possible understanding of our
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue sources and the
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
economy at large as many of you would
 
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
probably agree there is much uncertainty
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
about what the short-term and
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
medium-term future looks like
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
we relied heavily on state agencies to
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
provide detailed information on their
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
operations and revenue and revenue
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
expectations for the remainder of this
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal year as well as the next two
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
years we looked at all of these Revenue
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
sources from the very small to the very
 
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.949 align:start position:0%
sources from the very small to the very
large

00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
we have seen record growth rates above
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
plan or official estimates in some of
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
these areas in the 17 to 33 percent
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
range this year this has been quite
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
surprising and of course cannot be
 
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
expected to continue forever
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
like many of you we are concerned about
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
a recession or a downturn in the economy
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
overall and New Hampshire is no
 
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
exception all of us are heavily impacted
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
by inflation and Rising interest rates
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
and this situation is expected to
 
00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:36.829 align:start position:0%
and this situation is expected to
continue

00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
so how much of a downturn will we see in
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when will it occur and how
 
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
long will it last these are the
 
00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:46.019 align:start position:0%
questions we wrestled with every day in
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
in the end we built these Revenue
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
estimates from the bottom up
 
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
Brick by Brick to provide the numbers
 
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
before you today and just so you know
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
these are in your seat Pockets Color of
 
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.850 align:start position:0%
these are in your seat Pockets Color of
Money

00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
Money
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
overall we came in slightly below the
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
governor's estimates he was slightly
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
more optimistic than us on business
 
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
taxes as we expect these revenues to
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
actually go down in 2024 approximately
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
2.5 percent and then Grow Again one
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
percent in 2025.
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
however our committee was slightly more
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
optimistic than the governor on meals
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
and rooms taxes we actually believe they
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
will grow 1.5 percent in 2024 and then
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
2.5 percent in 2025.
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
the toughest Revenue estimate for us was
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
we started to see some warning signs
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire in January and
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
February we believe the volume and
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
prices of home sales will decrease about
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
5 in 2024 and then remain flat or stable
 
00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
in 2025.
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
in summary these numbers before you are
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
thoughtful reasonable and cautious
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
estimates we hope that you will support
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
the unanimous bipartisan efforts of this
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
committee and now I'll turn it over to
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
representative Army for her expert
 
00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:09.949 align:start position:0%
representative Army for her expert
wisdom

00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm very glad we've been able
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
to reach agreement on our Revenue
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
estimates because this year is the most
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
challenging that I have seen since the
 
00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
Great Recession
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
we cannot know the effect of several
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
structural changes made in the
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
all-important business taxes in recent
 
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
years until at least 2024.
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
but there is reason to worry about the
 
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
single sales factor and the credit carry
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
forward changes the first of which on
 
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by on the Senate and
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
the second of which was brought forward
 
00:15:52.449 --> 00:15:52.459 align:start position:0%
by us on
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
economists are reconsidering their
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
predictions of a recession or a simple
 
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.850 align:start position:0%
predictions of a recession or a simple
Slowdown

00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
Slowdown
 
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:00.980 align:start position:0%
weekly daily
 
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
it is just about impossible to do
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
anything except a crystal ball
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
you need to understand that the
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
governor's Revenue estimates had to be
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
set in cement in December so we are
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
operating with about 10 weeks more
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
information than he had
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
and I believe that at least on some of
 
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
these uh his uh his man who came to us
 
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:29.660 align:start position:0%
has agreed that
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
he was also lower
 
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
on I built I think that we agreed with
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
the February agency estimates 11 times
 
00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:43.259 align:start position:0%
including the highway and fishing game
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
funds and with the median of the
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue administration's
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
estimate Range four times and you've
 
00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
just heard about I believe
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
I I heard that you say talk about the
 
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax the meals
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax and the business taxes
 
00:17:11.169 --> 00:17:11.179 align:start position:0%
where we were 45 million below
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
the Department's median for the two
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
years about two percent
 
00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:19.579 align:start position:0%
this is our hardest text to negotiate
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
because of what all the economists are
 
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.429 align:start position:0%
because of what all the economists are
doing

00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
because each of us has different
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
experiences of
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
where we may be in the recession issue
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
we found ourselves in the cells in the
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
end 1.2 percent only below the agency's
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
numbers and 77 million dollars short of
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
them though a hundred million dollars
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
short of the December estimate that the
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
governor did
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%

foreign

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and good morning
 
00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:11.330 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and good morning
colleagues

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are many things that we need in
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we need lower energy
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
prices we need housing and we need
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
cheaper child care
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
but something that we don't need is a
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
bill that makes our streets our
 
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
gathering places and our schools any
 
00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:30.059 align:start position:0%
less safe than they already are and
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what HB 31 would do
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
it would end our state's current
 
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
prohibition on carrying or possessing
 
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:39.140 align:start position:0%
with the intent to sell
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
blackjacks metallic Knuckles better
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
known as brass knuckles
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
and an old-time dealer of Mayhem known
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
as a slung shot
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
so if you're like me you might be
 
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:51.620 align:start position:0%
thinking that the sponsors of the bill
 
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
might have misspelled slingshot that's
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
actually not the case a slingshot is
 
00:20:59.890 --> 00:20:59.900 align:start position:0%
actually a different animal
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
a slingshot doesn't shoot a projectile
 
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
what it what it is is basically a heavy
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
metal or stone weight that's attached to
 
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
a short rope or strap that's used in the
 
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
same potentially deadly way is a
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
blackjack so think of it as something
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
you twirl around and you can hit
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
somebody with
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
currently carrying or possessing these
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
weapons with the intent to sell them is
 
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor in New Hampshire and
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's for very good reason
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
a quick online search reveals case after
 
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
case in state after state where these
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
weapons have been used to horrible
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
effect in assaults
 
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
in addition to inflicting concussions
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
and potential brain damage these weapons
 
00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:44.419 align:start position:0%
can fracture skulls and break bones
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
lacerations from brass knuckle attacks
 
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
can leave wounds that require dozens of
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
stitches and plastic surgery to fix
 
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
that's if they can be fixed at all
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
something that I kept looking for as I
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
as I searched for information that would
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
be helpful would be even one story or
 
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
article that might actually show a case
 
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539 align:start position:0%
or example of how these weapons are
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually used in self-defense to stop an
 
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.370 align:start position:0%
actually used in self-defense to stop an
attacker

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
attacker
 
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
but while you it can occasionally find a
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%

you

you
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker this
 
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
bill is not about slung shots although I
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank the representative because I had
 
00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:48.539 align:start position:0%
no idea what that was either
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
um or brass knuckles or any of these
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
things frankly do you know what else
 
00:22:57.529 --> 00:22:57.539 align:start position:0%
causes horrible injury a wrench a
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
baseball bat a piece of pipe none of
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
those things are illegal
 
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
these are specifically targeted because
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
they're archaic when this was written
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
they were popular
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
if I challenge anyone in the room now Mr
 
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
Speaker to go on amazon.com you can
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
order a set of brass knuckles they call
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
them a paperweight it's not like these
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
things haven't been around they've been
 
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.370 align:start position:0%
things haven't been around they've been
around

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
there's no rash of assaults with with
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
these or would there be one because as I
 
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
said people can already have baseball
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
bats screwdrivers you name it
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
frankly this is about the Second
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment and so far as the courts ruled
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
that anything that can be handheld is a
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
personal weapon for example tasers we
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
all see tasers they sell them at Walmart
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
it's an electric weapon
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court said you can have
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
those so why are we targeting these
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
antiques to say that you can't have them
 
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
they're available for self-defense
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
someone smaller than someone else may
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
find that helpful to use to protect
 
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
themselves there's a lot of scenarios
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
where someone could use something like
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
this small handy in their pocket
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
probably not a slung shot though that
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
sounds kind of complicated but as I said
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is a second amendment issue it's
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
not really about the name of the weapons
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
in here it's the fact that whether or
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
not our citizens have the right to
 
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.140 align:start position:0%

people who put us here would be appalled

that they are still useful for

thank you Mr Speaker

Mr Speaker it was a month ago today that
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice committee met in
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
this chamber it took up HP 32 and
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
several other builds
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
it is the prime sponsor of this bill I
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
was the first one to speak that day
 
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
and that was somewhat bittersweet
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
because my speaking pot was finished but
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
sitting down and hearing other people
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
get up and speak against the bill
 
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
in expressing their opinions was
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
somewhat disappointing to me
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
the late U.S senator Senator Daniel
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
Patrick Moynihan once said
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
everybody is entitled to their opinions
 
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
but everybody is not entitled to their
 
00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.810 align:start position:0%
but everybody is not entitled to their
facts

00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
facts
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
so when I was thinking about speaking to
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
all of you today I thought what I would
 
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.730 align:start position:0%
all of you today I thought what I would
do

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
was go back to that
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
hearing a month ago
 
00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
and try to address some of the things I
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
heard in the testimony from those who
 
00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:18.419 align:start position:0%
were opposed to this legislation
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
one woman from Manchester
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
told the committee that she had she
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
lived in Manchester and she had two
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
daughters that she brought to school
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
and she was concerned with the bill
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
because under this bill she would not be
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
able to carry her gun with her have her
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
gun with her when dropping them off
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
and I had a very nice email from a
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
member of the House who addressed that
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
same issue he brought his children to
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
school every morning he carried a gun
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
and as I said to him in my email in
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
response under this bill it clearly says
 
00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
that if you're not going onto the school
 
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.549 align:start position:0%
that if you're not going onto the school
grounds

00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
grounds
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
you're not doing anything wrong if you
 
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
come onto the school grounds and you
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
want to go into the school then you've
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
got to make sure your firearm is secured
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
in the vehicle
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
but for people dropping children off
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
that is not a problem the same with one
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
man that said now I can't drive by my
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
school if I'm on because I'm in within a
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
thousand feet of the school
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
as the legislation says this bill
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
pertains to those on the school grounds
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
not carrying a firearm with them
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
the bill says that if you come onto the
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
school grounds in your arm then you've
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
got to secure your gun in your vehicle
 
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
like you normally would anyway before
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
going into the school
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
now I've been a licensed Tanner in New
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now for over 50 years
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
actually 10 years over 50 years
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
God I'm getting old but um
 
00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
so I'm not anti-gun and I own guns long
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
guns and handguns
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a provision in this build I
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
know a lot of people myself when I was
 
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
in school used to go deer hunting after
 
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.510 align:start position:0%
in school used to go deer hunting after
school

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
there's a provision if a student wants
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
to go hunting you just keep your shotgun
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going or a rifle just locked
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
up in the rack of the vehicle keep it
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
school property to get to a cornfield to
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%

00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:27.549 align:start position:0%
shotgun and cross the property you're
fine

00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
uh one person said and I think it was at
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
the hearing well if your home is next to
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
now you're within a thousand feet of
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
school you can't own a gun
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
no part two of the bill if you read it
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
says this bill does not pertain to
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
private property
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
of course you can reach out to your
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
kitchen window and touch the school you
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
can still own it
 
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
own a gun if it's just when you're on
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
school property
 
00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.210 align:start position:0%
school property
um

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of some of the other
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
things one person I understand said if
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'm walking into my children to school
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
and I'm assaulted I can't use my weapon
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
to defend my children and myself
 
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.310 align:start position:0%
to defend my children and myself
again

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
if you're on a public way the bill says
 
00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:16.019 align:start position:0%
as long as you shouldn't on a school
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
property and you have a legal right to
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
have a firearm you have a legal right to
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
defend yourself
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
we got a lot of bills today and I'm
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
going to stop here but you know
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
I didn't submit this bill because I'm
 
00:33:33.409 --> 00:33:33.419 align:start position:0%
anti-gun or Auntie Hunter because I am
 
00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:34.850 align:start position:0%
anti-gun or Auntie Hunter because I am
one

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
I submitted this bill really for two
 
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.330 align:start position:0%
I submitted this bill really for two
reasons

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
Sarah and Alex those are my
 
00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:42.539 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and I'm thinking about
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
your grandchildren your kids there are
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
certain places in New Hampshire we just
 
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
don't allow Firearms airports jails
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
prisons courtrooms and other places we
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
don't need them on school grounds and
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'd ask you to please to support this
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker we just heard a lot of facts
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
I would like to address some of those
 
00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:14.750 align:start position:0%
I would like to address some of those
facts

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
facts
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
the fact is it is murder
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
if you take a weapon into a school
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
and your intention is to kill somebody
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
and you do it
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
this bill will not make it
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
former Mr Speaker mentioned that if you
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
want to go hunting you can still do that
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
however if you read the bill it clearly
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
states that if you need to access a
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
hunting trail that you have to access
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
by means of a school ground you have to
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
have permission
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
from somebody at the school in order to
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
he mentioned that this does not affect
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
you if you have private property with
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's within a thousand feet of a
 
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
school zone
 
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
okay well it may not affect you if you
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
live within a thousand feet
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
but what about if you are walking your
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
child to school
 
00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:11.579 align:start position:0%
what happens when you get within a
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
thousand feet are you supposed to put
 
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
your firearm in somebody's mailbox
 
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to just lay it down mean
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
he mentioned if you're picking your
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
child up from school okay well if you
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
read the bill
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
you have to have your gun unloaded or it
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
has to be locked I can stand here and
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
give you examples of family members that
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
I have had unfortunately maybe many of
 
00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:41.099 align:start position:0%
you have had that did not have the
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to call and ask for help
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the opportunity to call
 
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
for a police officer
 
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
I have a family member that is dead
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
today because he didn't have the ability
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
to call and ask for help
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is if you have
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
if you're carrying your gun on a school
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
ground you've had to go to your local
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
police department you had to go get a
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
concealed carry permit which means you
 
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
had to fill out
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
a form you had to go through a
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%

00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%

00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
daughter as a senior in high school who

weighs less than 100 pounds and stands
 
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:33.300 align:start position:0%

every classroom
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
first looking for exits then looking for

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
and then looking for who in the
 
00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:44.339 align:start position:0%
classroom she believes is more important
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
than she is so she knows whose body to
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
throw her own in front of
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
and if I know that in the first three
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
months of this year more than one
 
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
thousand children and teenagers have

been killed or wounded by gunfire
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
and if I believe that if we were to
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
and allow for another motion that that
 
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
other motion would support the public
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
good would I now press the red button to
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl so another motion can be
 
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.370 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl so another motion can be
made

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%

an incident out of school the people who
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
waited while people were slaughtered and
 
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that having a
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
weapon with you would not make you have
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%

House Bill 59 is a fairly simple bill
 
00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
it's about background checks
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
it's about closing a loophole in the

background checks are constitutional
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're common sense and they save lives
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
background checks are the foundation of
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
any comprehensive gun violence

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
the primary objective of a background
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
check is to keep Firearms out of the
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
background checks do not restrict or
 
00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
regulate firearms
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
they regulate buyers

they prohibit they keep guns out of the

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
they only regulate and prevent firearm

sales to people or prohibited persons
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
and actually they do not have the right
 
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
to own a gun under the Second Amendment
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
Law requires background checks only for
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
sales completed by a licensed firearm
 
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.010 align:start position:0%
sales completed by a licensed firearm
dealer

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
dealer
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
this situation effectively exempts
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
commercial transactions between private
 
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.970 align:start position:0%
commercial transactions between private
parties

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
the bill seeks to close this loophole in
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
state and federal law
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
by requiring commercial transactions
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
taking place between private parties who
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
are not licensed firearm dealers
 
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
and who do not know each other
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
to include a background check obtained
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
one of the objections you will hear
 
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
about this bill is that as written
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
every time a unlicensed seller transfers
 
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
or sells or transfers of firearm they
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
have to get a background check
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
due to an unfortunate clerical error
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
a critical paragraph Was omitted from
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
the bill as submitted
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
that paragraph indicated that background
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
checks are not required if it can be
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
ascertained that neither party to the
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
transaction is a primitive person
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
however the omitted language is a is
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
actually in the analysis of the bill it
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
actually says that in the bill but that
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you to please vote no to
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
defeat the itl
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
read the amendment
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
0387 printed in the calendar on page 33.
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
so the clerical error can be corrected
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
in an ought to pass with Amendment
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
motion can be made
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I asked for a
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
this bill changed the definition of a
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
commercial sale
 
00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:25.819 align:start position:0%
currently this bill is unnecessary
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
conflicting and duplicative
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
currently all federal firearms licensed
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
dealers are required to conduct a
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
background check on all firearms sales
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
and transfers
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire the
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
department of safety additionally
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
conducts all handgun in what's
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
classified as another sale
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
the all long guns Firearms purchases
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
that are conducted via the Federal
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Investigation Nix Center for
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
each entity provides a tracking number
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of the status
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
of the outcome
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
under current federal law
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
under the age of 21
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
anyone is automatically delayed and
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
additionally delayed for 10 days this
 
00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
was part of bipartisan support that was
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
just implemented I believe it was around
 
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
one of the concerning parts of this bill
 
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
is establishing the following definition
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
of commercial sales being transfer
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
ownership of a firearm included but not
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
limited to the sale exchange or gift
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
another concerning part of this bill is
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
159 F3 successful completion of a
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
background check no firearms shall be
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
delivered to an individual pursuant to a
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
commercial sale until Nix has issued a
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
proceed response
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
it is not uncommon in the Firearms
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
business to not receive a proceed status
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
for weeks months on a very rare occasion
 
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
it should be judicially noted that
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
Firearms is transferred and the buyer is
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
found to be a prohibited person the batf
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
bureau called back on firearms and the
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police are notified
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
by the dealer currently New Hampshire
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
law prohibits a sale transfer of a
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
firearm to a person who is not
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%

obligation to conduct a background check

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
if I know background checks are
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
constitutional common sense and they
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
save lives and are the foundation of any

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
and if I know the bill seeks to close
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
the loophole in state and federal law
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
that allows unlicensed people who do not
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
know each other to complete a firearm
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
sale without a background check
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that the bill as
 
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
introduced omits critical information
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
that describes when background checks
 
00:51:27.049 --> 00:51:27.059 align:start position:0%
are not required
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button so that
 
00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:32.579 align:start position:0%
the itl can be defeated the clerical
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
Omission can be corrected and the bill
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
can be debated in its entirety thank you

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
know that it is current New Hampshire
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
law that it is illegal to sell a firearm
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
to someone you don't know and it is
 
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
current federal law that is a felony to
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
sell a firearm to someone who is a
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
prohibited person
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know that the only
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
way to enforce this law would be to
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
create a gun registry so that they could
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
track every single gun that is traded
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%

passed this law last session because we

style pistols were legal and we bought
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
millions of them and then they decided
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
one day not so much now they're illegal
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
this law was passed by us so that our
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would not be used as a
 
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
tool of the federal government to
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%

gun violence tragedies that HB 106 aim
 
01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
to prevent are often preceded by red
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
flags warning signs such as threats and
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
other dangerous Behavior
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
despite their desire and willingness to
 
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
help law enforcement and the loved ones
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
of those in crisis are thwarted in their
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%

appropriate and proactive intervention
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
without the power to do so
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
without such proactive action those in
 
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%

01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
they might have remain at heightened and
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
unnecessary risk of harm
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
why does New Hampshire need a red flag
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
Bill like HP 106
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
under current New Hampshire statute a
 
01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:27.299 align:start position:0%
person who displays warning signs that
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
they're considering suicide or engaging
 
01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:32.339 align:start position:0%
in a violent act but who is not a
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
prohibited person under the federal gun
 
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
control act law would still be able to
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
legally buy and possess firearms
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
89 percent of all New Hampshire gun
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
deaths are suicides
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
in 2020 New Hampshire's gun suicide rate
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
was around 17 percent higher than the
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
national average suicides attempted with
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%

01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
HP 106 is a life-saving tool that will
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
allow people in crisis the chance to get
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
the health they need and prevent those
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
foreseeable warning signs from
 
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:11.940 align:start position:0%

Hampshire citizens
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a few minutes to
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
clarify what a New Hampshire extreme
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
risk protective order is and what it
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
isn't it finally addressed
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
constitutionality and due process
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
urpo orders provide an Avenue for law
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
enforcement and a very limited group of
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
people to ask the courts for assistance
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
in protecting a loved one or in law
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%

about constitutionality and due process
 
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
red flag bills have been enacted in 19

States in DC
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%

01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
standards set by the United States

Supreme Court
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
and have been found to be
 
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
constitutionally sound and to withstand
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
due process challenges in Indiana and

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
let's talk about why hb106 is consistent
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
with the Second Amendment and satisfies
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
due process
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
though we're often reminded that part 1
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
article 2A of the New Hampshire
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
Constitution provides that all persons
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
have the right to keep and bear arms and
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
defense of themselves their families
 
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
their property in the state let us not
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
forget that in the landmark case
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
District of Columbia versus Heller the
 
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court determined that the rights
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
secured by the Second Amendment is not
 
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
unlimited and is subject to
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
presumptively lawful regulatory measures
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
in that case Justice Scalia has made
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
clear that like most rights the rights
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
secured by the Second Amendment right is
 
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
not unlimited he noted it is not a right
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
in any manner whatsoever and for
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
whatever purpose
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
HB 106 is also consistent with article
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
2A the New Hampshire Constitution State
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
versus Smith says the state
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to bear arms is not
 
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
absolute and may be subject to
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
restriction and regulation
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
rejected of an Article II challenge to
 
01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire in state B Smith the
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
Smith Court found that the state right
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
to keep and bear arms is not absolute
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
and concluded that a restriction of that
 
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
right is valid as long as it narrowly
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
serves a significant government interest
 
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
the Court held that the interests served
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
by the statute
 
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
or the protection of human life and
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
property and the statute narrowly serves
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
those in interest by prohibiting a
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
category of persons likely to be
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous from possessing dangerous
 
01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.229 align:start position:0%
dangerous from possessing dangerous
weapons

01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
HB 106 satisfies the requirements of the
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
due process clause in the United States
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution the ex parte hearings
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
included within this bill are based upon
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
existing New Hampshire domestic violence
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
laws that courts have repeatedly upheld
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
against due process challenges
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
a pre-hearing deprivation followed by a
 
01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
full hearing within a reasonable time
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
frame is incorporated within HB 106 and
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
satisfies the due process of law
 
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
required by the Constitution
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
in a variety of other cases the United
 
01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:33.140 align:start position:0%
States Supreme Court has made clear that
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
pre-hearing deprivations are
 
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
constitutional especially in emergency
 
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
situations the court has recognized that
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
in multiple contexts that where a state
 
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
must act quickly or it would be imp
 
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
where it would be impractical to provide
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
pre-deprivation process
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
post their probation process satisfies
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
the requirement of the due process
 
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.610 align:start position:0%
the requirement of the due process
clause

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
clause
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
The Prompt evidentiary hearing and high
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
burden of proof evidence standard as
 
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
well as the provision of penalty for
 
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
false allegation as proof satisfactory
 
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
for constitutional objections addressing
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
due process in other states with similar
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
urpo laws
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
despite a reluctance by some to
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that we have a gun violence
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
problem here in New Hampshire we do
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
ask the family or friends of any gun
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
suicide or homicide victim
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
ask law enforcement and our Mental
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
Health Providers ask the family and
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
friends of those who evidenced warning
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
signs of impending
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
gun violence toward themselves or others
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
yet absent a bill like HB 160 and the
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
despite the best efforts of those who
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
cared about that individual
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
life-altering or ending action occurred
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
when that person got access to a firearm
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
watch the news look at the dedications
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
in high school and college year books to
 
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
deceased students who didn't live to
 
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
graduation read the obituary pages of
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
our local newspaper we are trying to
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
tying the collective protective hands of
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
our society when we fail to take the
 
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
most minimal action to provide families
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement a tool to protect
 
01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
those in crisis and those that might
 
01:14:23.699 --> 01:14:24.770 align:start position:0%
those in crisis and those that might
harm

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
harm
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
I believe we can all agree that firearms
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
and the hands of dangerous people are a
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
threat to Public Safety this is common
 
01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
sense it's time to now to address that
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
threat and put a common sense solution
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
into statute
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
please show the people of New Hampshire
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
we are serious about saving lives and
 
01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
protecting Public Safety and press the
 
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
red button to vote against the itl so
 
01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
another devotion can be made Mr Speaker
 
01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
I asked for a division vote thank you
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker what we
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
just heard from my uh honorable
 
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
colleague friend is absolutely true it
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
is dangerous to let people who are
 
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
dangerous to themselves or others walk
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
around unchecked and aren't however
 
01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
thankfully I discovered RSA 135c 27-33
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
we already have an involuntary
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
commitment process in New Hampshire if
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
someone is deemed to be dangerous they
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
can be committed for 10 days for
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
psychological evaluation and they will
 
01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
not have firearms where they are
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
contained so the problem solved already
 
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
we can already do it if someone is
 
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
dangerous they talk about killing people
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
with suicide their family members can go
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
right to the court put a petition in and
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
they will be admitted if the court
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
agrees they are a danger
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
this law proposed is very complicated as
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
you just heard and it puts the defendant
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
in the position of having to pay for an
 
01:15:59.689 --> 01:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
attorney to prove that he's not going to
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
do something
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's not how it works in America we
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the pre-crime unit if you
 
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
have not done something you do not get
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
charged because you might and you do not
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
lose your rights and property because
 
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
you might do something we have a mental
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
health law to take care of that
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
and we have the Constitution to take
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
care of this I ask you the Sports
 
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
representative Senator natasto requests
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%

01:16:30.239 --> 01:16:32.630 align:start position:0%
that are all callers that's efficiently
seconded

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
seconded
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded members will
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker after voting on
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 498 at the last session I
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
realized I made a mistake when I was
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
pressing the button I later found out
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
that other members also felt that they
 
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
voted incorrectly so I moved that we
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
revisit House Bill 498 for
 
01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:22.739 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker and thank you for
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak on this I would
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
like to see this vote the
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
reconsideration vote passed because I
 
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
think I've talked to people there's a
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion on exactly what goes on
 
01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
here I think there's an awful lot of
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
people that weren't aware that uh fish
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
and game department is allowed to
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
provide to perform warrantless searches
 
01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the bill itself
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
just promotion for reconsideration and I
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
think I mean enough people were confused
 
01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:05.219 align:start position:0%
on the issue that if we have a chance to
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
explain it again I think the vote may
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
change thank you
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:27.420 align:start position:0%

01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%

01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee everybody has said no
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%

01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee having
 
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
considered the same being unable to
 
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority Report with the
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
pass instead of John R wheeler for the
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
jono wheeler for the minority of the
 
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.229 align:start position:0%
jono wheeler for the minority of the
committee

01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.010 --> 01:27:18.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine along with many other
 
01:27:20.159 --> 01:27:21.770 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine along with many other
psychedelics

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
psychedelics
 
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
has been maligned since the 1960s when
 
01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
it was all psychedelics were attached to
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
Vietnam War resistance and the like
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
but their
 
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
effects on depression addiction
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
PTSD a whole host of mental issues is
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
well documented
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's just not voluminous because the
 
01:27:46.129 --> 01:27:46.139 align:start position:0%
federal government and other entities
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
including big Pharma have endeavored to
 
01:27:51.169 --> 01:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
bury it we have something like 13
 
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
percent of Americans on antidepressants
 
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
that's according to the CDC
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
so right now in this room we have 50
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
people on Skittles and we need to figure
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
out why it's occurring and to move these
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
people off of these dangerous drugs onto
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
something that so DMT when we trip on
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
DMT let's say six minutes 20 minutes
 
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
whatever it is nobody's getting in a car
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
and going to drive the 7-Eleven while
 
01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
they're tripping on DMT
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
so it's not dangerous for the reasons
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
cited in the the committee report no
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
there's no Public Safety factor in
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
Canterbury right now as we heard during
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
the testimony related to the bill
 
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
there are people undergoing therapy with
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
this all the time there's no reports of
 
01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:38.219 align:start position:0%
any crazies running around naked in
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
Canterbury doing crazy things so we have
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
well maybe there are I haven't seen them
 
01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:44.629 align:start position:0%
well maybe there are I haven't seen them
so

01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:44.639 --> 01:28:45.649 align:start position:0%
so
okay

01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
I'm right next door in Northfield so
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
in the U.S news and World Report there's
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
the headline is in April 20th article of
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
this of 2022. in Long Run
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
antidepressants don't improve quality of
 
01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:00.290 align:start position:0%
antidepressants don't improve quality of
life

01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
which I think we all know but we don't
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
really want to admit because big Pharma
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
tells us every time you turn on the TV
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
brought to you by Pfizer so
 
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.629 align:start position:0%
brought to you by Pfizer so
so

01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
in another in a BBC article
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
they wrote while conventional drugs May
 
01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
numb negative feelings quote these drugs
 
01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
seem to allow you to approach difficult
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
experiences in your life sit with that
 
01:29:20.159 --> 01:29:22.310 align:start position:0%
experiences in your life sit with that
distress

01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
distress
 
01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
and process them
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
it might be getting us something more
 
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
fundamental that was the root cause of
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
the problem Professor Morgan said
 
01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
through that we think you can get much
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
more lasting change
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
and now I'm going to go segue to
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
Veterans so we all know that veterans
 
01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:38.219 align:start position:0%
are committing suicide at a much higher
 
01:29:38.219 --> 01:29:39.169 align:start position:0%
are committing suicide at a much higher
rate

01:29:39.169 --> 01:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
than average Americans or non-veterans
 
01:29:44.530 --> 01:29:44.540 align:start position:0%
so we've had
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
6100 veteran suicides in 2020 alone and
 
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
we've had 20 consecutive years
 
01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
of over 6 000 veterans committing
 
01:29:57.169 --> 01:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
suicide every year six thousand people
 
01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's a huge number so what are we
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
going to do more antidepressants they
 
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
so veterans account for more than nine
 
01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
percent of all adults experiencing
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
homelessness in the U.S
 
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
and 39 000 on any given day
 
01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:17.629 align:start position:0%
and 39 000 on any given day
so

01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
I bring that up into talk about the
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
situation in Concord which I don't know
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
if you guys noticed but there's a whole
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
bunch of homeless people in Concord so
 
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
at the late recent delegation meeting we
 
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
were talking about this in this 300
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
homeless they've documented I don't know
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
how they they tag them but they've
 
01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
counted that many and 30 have applied
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
for housing vouchers
 
01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
so only 10 percent of them are actually
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
looking to kind of reintegrate into
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
society so let's kind of figure out why
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
do you think maybe these people have
 
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
mental illnesses that they they don't
 
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
want to take these psych meds for so
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
maybe we can think about different
 
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
alternative means that are safer pure
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
and a one-time treatment instead of
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
giving them Skittles every day to take
 
01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.470 align:start position:0%
giving them Skittles every day to take
so

01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh last thing to talk about is
 
01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
psilocybin magic mushrooms I don't know
 
01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
what you guys are familiar with
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
they've been legalized in Denver
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
in Portland and also I just found out
 
01:31:14.209 --> 01:31:14.219 align:start position:0%
where is this in Massachusetts
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
Somerville Massachusetts actually
 
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
decriminalized them in 2021. so
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
we got to kind of realize what we're
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
doing with and we're not dealing with
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
some kind of Dangerous Drug we're
 
01:31:24.649 --> 01:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
dealing with something that can help
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
people process
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
psychological trauma so yeah everybody
 
01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
in here wants to consider they got their
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
stuff together but you know what a lot
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
of people in this state don't so we have
 
01:31:35.209 --> 01:31:35.219 align:start position:0%
to provide a means for them to do it and
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
I think this is a safer more cost
 
01:31:40.129 --> 01:31:40.139 align:start position:0%
effective means of doing it than buying
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
into the big Pharma propaganda and
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
lifelong customer model that we
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
currently see
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
so I ask that you support this bill and
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
allow New Hampshire residents to Live
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
Free or Die and choose the treatments
 
01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
that they wish
 
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
to use to treat their disorders thank
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%

of psychedelics and and I'll put that
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
before I ask the question

are you aware of any cases of accidental
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%

01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:13.820 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this bill would exempt
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine DMT from the
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act DMT is a naturally
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
occurring psychedelic compound that is

found in many if not all plants and
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
animals including humans it's been used
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%

experiences
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
DMT is capable of inducing profound
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
life-changing experiences
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
it produces an intense experience with
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
Visual and auditory effects altered
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
perceptions of time and space and a
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
sense of transcending the physical world
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
DMT has been found to have an
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary ability to transport
 
01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
individuals into a completely different
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
realm of existence people report being
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
blast out of their bodies and countering
 
01:34:02.330 --> 01:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
beings of different forms and

beings of different forms and
experiencing

01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:03.620 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
intense spiritual Revelations that are
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
impossible to put into words
 
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
some describe it as seeing God or being
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
in the presence of a higher power
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
DMT has been shown to change uh have a
 
01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
change in the personality trait openness
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
by one standard deviation permanently
 
01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
and many people state that their DMT
 
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
experience is the most significant
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
experience of their entire life
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
multiple U.S Supreme courses have
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
already ruled in favor of churches using
 
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
DMT and recently the New Hampshire
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled that a Man convicted
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
of possession of psilocybin was
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
wrongfully tried because his use in the
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
Psychedelic was part of his religious
 
01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.169 align:start position:0%
Psychedelic was part of his religious
practice

01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
the court cited part one Article 5 of
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Constitution
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
which maintains that each person has a
 
01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
natural and unable right to worship God
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
based on their own conscious and that
 
01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:56.060 align:start position:0%
that individual shall not be hurt
 
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
molested or restrained in their
 
01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
religious practices
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
provided he did not disturb the public
 
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
peace or disturb others in their
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
religious worship
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
so this bill just catches up the rsas to
 
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
the current New Hampshire law
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
DMT is not toxic or addictive it's
 
01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
impossible to overdose on DMT and DMT
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
isn't even done Often by users it's done
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
maybe once a year and for many it's
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
they'll only do it once in their entire
 
01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.570 align:start position:0%
they'll only do it once in their entire
life

01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh the and the only one and committee
 
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
the only testimony against it was uh
 
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative uh from the New Hampshire
 
01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
State Police and he was arguing that it
 
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
could be a public it was a public safety
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
issue because it could create an
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
impaired driver
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
um and it's just something the police
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
aren't familiar with uh he didn't have
 
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
much knowledge on what the effects of
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
dmtr DMT actually acts immediately on
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
the user and will uh instantly disable
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
them so from physical activity so and it
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
only lasts like five or ten minutes with
 
01:35:59.209 --> 01:35:59.219 align:start position:0%
no after a factor hangover so it's not
 
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
even possible to be driving a car
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
um so in conclusion I ask members to
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
affirm part one Article Five of the New
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
every individual has a natural and
 
01:36:11.209 --> 01:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
unalienable right to worship God
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
according to the dictates of his own
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
conscious and reason and no subject
 
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
shall be hurt molested or restrained in
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
his personal Liberty or state for
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
worshiping God in the manner and season
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
most agreeable to the dictates of his
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
own conscious or for his religious
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
profession sentiments or persuasion
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
provided he did not disturb the public
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
peace or disturb others in their
 
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
religious worship
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
this constitutional Point has already
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
been litigated on in the New Hampshire
 
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and it was found in the
 
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
case of the possession of psilocybin
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
that the individual was wrongfully tried
 
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:37:04.930 --> 01:37:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
navigating hearing aids can be an issue
 
01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:11.330 align:start position:0%
navigating hearing aids can be an issue
sometimes

01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.050 --> 01:37:14.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine or DMT is a
 
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
hallucinogenic drug that is currently
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
classified as a schedule 1 controlled
 
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
substance under both Federal and New
 
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
in our State penalties apply for making
 
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
it selling it buying it or possessing it
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
but because it is used by certain
 
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
religious groups for religious
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
ceremonies our courts have carved out a
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
reasonable objection for people who use
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
DMT as part of their religion
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we focus on in
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
our committee whenever we're called on
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
to consider legalizing any substance
 
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
whether it's a hallucinogenic a
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
hallucinogenic or something else there's
 
01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
currently illegal is its potential
 
01:37:59.330 --> 01:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
impact on public safety
 
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
our responsibility when we consider
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
bills like this is to balance the very
 
01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
real right of individuals to control
 
01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
what they choose to put into what put in
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
their own bodies against society's need
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
to minimize situations where people
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
especially kids can consume things that
 
01:38:20.209 --> 01:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
make themselves a danger to themselves
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
and or to others
 
01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
while there's growing evidence that DMT
 
01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
may be a game-changing treatment for
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
PTSD and other mental illnesses
 
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill that carves out
 
01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
special exceptions for medical usage
 
01:38:42.370 --> 01:38:42.380 align:start position:0%
what HB 216 does is to effectively erase
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
DMT from our New Hampshire statute
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
so if this bill passes any limitations
 
01:38:51.649 --> 01:38:51.659 align:start position:0%
on making it selling it buying it
 
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
possessing it or consuming it would
 
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
disappear in New Hampshire 60 days after
 
01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:58.250 align:start position:0%
disappear in New Hampshire 60 days after
Passage

01:38:58.250 --> 01:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
unlike some of the legalization bills
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we've seen for other substances in
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
this body this bill has no guard rails
 
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
to protect miners no educational
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
elements to promote responsible use
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
and no protections of any sort for
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
anyone who cares to use it
 
01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing we heard
 
01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
testimony that a small but significant
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who use
 
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.950 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who use
dimethyltryptamine

01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine
 
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
experience serious side effects
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
these side effects can range from a
 
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
dangerous acceleration of heartbeat in
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
some users some people who take it can
 
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
also experience a reaction known as
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
serotonin shock
 
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
this reaction can occur in people who
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
are already taking antidepressants
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
so if you combine some of the reasons
 
01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:50.699 align:start position:0%
why people might want to take a drug
 
01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
like DMT it might be for depression
 
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
it might be for it might be for PTSD it
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
might be for other forms of mental
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
illness you can see where serotonin
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
shock would be something that could
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
we don't dispute the fact that there are
 
01:40:14.209 --> 01:40:14.219 align:start position:0%
some people who may experience benefits
 
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
but the potential for unintended
 
01:40:19.129 --> 01:40:19.139 align:start position:0%
consequences at a point in time where
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement our medical community
 
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
and our families are already dealing
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
with a fentanyl epidemic is far too
 
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
great and there is simply too many
 
01:40:30.169 --> 01:40:30.179 align:start position:0%
unknowns at this point
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
so should we allow the use of DMT in
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
clinical settings the way that we do for
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
01:40:40.450 --> 01:40:40.460 align:start position:0%
maybe but that's not what this bill does
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is simply wipe DMT
 
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
off the books in a way that is not
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
responsible in the middle of a fentanyl
 
01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.750 align:start position:0%
responsible in the middle of a fentanyl
epidemic

01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
epidemic
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
so what I would urge you to do is to
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
support the committee recommendation and
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
vote green to itl the bill that's in
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
front of us and Mr Speaker I request a
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
division vote does the member yield the
 
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
questions I do remember yields I mean
 
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you speaker Mr Speaker are you
 
01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
aware of any method given given the
 
01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
situation that currently stands where we
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
commonly find things like Fentanyl and
 
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
cyclazine in other drugs are you aware
 
01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
of any method legal method at this point
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to test or analyze so that
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
people would have any idea if it was
 
01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:37.340 align:start position:0%
legalized people would have any
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
Assurance in what is actually in what
 
01:41:43.729 --> 01:41:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
my under my understanding is that most
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the DMT that's produced in New
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not uh something that's
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
coming in over the Border it's actually
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
something that's produced by by the
 
01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
folks who are actually using it uh for
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
religious ceremonies and other people
 
01:42:00.890 --> 01:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
who happen to get a hold of uh uh the
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
plants that you need to make to make the
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
drug so I think the risk at this point
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
and this is just off the top of my head
 
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
of it you know showing up in a pill like
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
xylazine does with fentanyl is is
 
01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:16.139 align:start position:0%
actually pretty minimal
 
01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
as a member yield a further question
 
01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.510 align:start position:0%
as a member yield a further question
yes

01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Muse in your
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
testimony you said that the people who
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
took DMT may be a danger to society
 
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
could you tell us a little bit more
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
pointed how someone who ingests DMT and
 
01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
meet someone from Another Universe
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
potentially is a danger to society I I
 
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's not the they themselves represent a
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
danger to society but one of the things
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
that we did here is that when you are
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
under the influence of this drug you are
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
someplace else you're not here
 
01:42:58.250 --> 01:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that the state
 
01:43:00.169 --> 01:43:00.179 align:start position:0%
police rightly or wrongly expressed is
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know how quickly can you get back
 
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel of a motor vehicle
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
after you take something like this
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
um so part I think part of the issue you
 
01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
know when we talk about uh you know the
 
01:43:16.970 --> 01:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
danger to society there are some direct
 
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
risks like what happens if somebody
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
drives but I think you know the other
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
thing that we need to consider is that
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is not a drug that's been tested
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
much or it if at all on kids
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
so I mean it you know to to essentially
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
take the reins off of it and put kids in
 
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
a situation where they can legally buy
 
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:38.810 align:start position:0%
a situation where they can legally buy
it

01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:39.470 align:start position:0%
it
um

01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
seems to be pretty irresponsible thing
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
for us to do so
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
so what I would say is as a member of
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice committee sometimes
 
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's very frustrating we get bills like
 
01:43:55.810 --> 01:43:55.820 align:start position:0%
this that deal with drugs like
 
01:43:58.129 --> 01:43:58.139 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine and psilocybin
 
01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:00.659 align:start position:0%
because we're not MediCal experts all we
 
01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
can really do is evaluate the risk to
 
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
Public Safety what we can't do well is
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
evaluate the medical risks and and I
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
think if that's something that the
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill would like to do in
 
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
the future then I think a different Bill
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
a different kind of Bill going to a
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
different committee might be the way to
 
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
achieve it so remember yield a further
 
01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:24.770 align:start position:0%
achieve it so remember yield a further
question

01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:25.970 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
sir Roy McGuire thank you Mr speaker
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:30.890 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
representative

01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:32.689 --> 01:44:32.699 align:start position:0%
um representative we just heard that you
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
know this can make you launch into space
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
and the snozberries taste like
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
snozberries and all that stuff but
 
01:44:40.609 --> 01:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
can you explain to us what the sponsor
 
01:44:42.649 --> 01:44:42.659 align:start position:0%
put in the bill as safeguards and
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines to protect children because I
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
understand children can't buy cigarettes
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
now but if this past would they just be
 
01:44:51.649 --> 01:44:51.659 align:start position:0%
able to buy this stuff
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
what the bill actually does is exempt
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine from the controlled
 
01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:01.139 align:start position:0%
Drug Act that's it it erases it it
 
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite erase it that's actually
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
not not quite what it does what it does
 
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
is it puts an exception in there that
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
basically accepts it from the control
 
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
Drug Act
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
so there are no guard rails on its
 
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
production on its sale who can buy it
 
01:45:19.129 --> 01:45:19.139 align:start position:0%
who can sell it who can make it how
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
strong it needs to be whether it has
 
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
contaminants in it nothing
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
son of San Antonio has requested a roll
 
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
it's not sufficiently seconded this will
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
members take your seats there was a
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%

01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
a division vote
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative senator
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
find out that DMT has no public safety
 
01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:02.570 align:start position:0%
find out that DMT has no public safety
hazard

01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
hazard
 
01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the use of DMT is
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
protected by part one Article 5 of The
 
01:47:09.410 --> 01:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
Constitution for religious use and that
 
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
our constitutional rights do not require
 
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
guard rails
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
and if I know that DMT naturally exists
 
01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
in the human body
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that DMT is
 
01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
reported to have people experience the
 
01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:24.659 align:start position:0%
most significant experience of their
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
life then when I press the red button to
 
01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh so we can make another motion thank
 
01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:32.450 align:start position:0%
uh so we can make another motion thank

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't want children to be able to walk
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
into the store and get a pack of
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
Bubblicious and some mushrooms or
 
01:47:55.609 --> 01:47:55.619 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have an established
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
protocol a public notification when
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
sobriety checkpoints are planned we do
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
this not because we want to encourage
 
01:50:49.129 --> 01:50:49.139 align:start position:0%
people driving Under the Influence to go
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
around the checkpoints
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
rather we aim to decrease the potential
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
imposition on everyday citizens going
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
about their everyday lives
 
01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
yet until now we've allowed the
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
imposition of the federal government
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
setting up immigration checkpoints up to
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
a hundred miles away from the border the
 
01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
actual Border in the exact same way with
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
no public notice
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
now I want you to picture how much of
 
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
is within the 100 mile overlapping
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the U.S border Patrol in
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
fact it's all of it
 
01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
the entire State a state where we
 
01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
respect excuse me where we respect
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
privacy rights and the right to be free
 
01:51:32.169 --> 01:51:32.179 align:start position:0%
of arbitrary stops and searches
 
01:51:34.609 --> 01:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
basically the definition of a checkpoint
 
01:51:37.609 --> 01:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
is subjected to the whims of the border
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
patrol now I understand the need for
 
01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
vigilance I understand that the border
 
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
patrol has a job to do
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire residents whether
 
01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
longtime residents visitors or newly
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
naturalized citizens do not deserve to
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
be arbitrarily stopped and searched
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
without notice
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
many of our constituents also depend on
 
01:52:00.169 --> 01:52:00.179 align:start position:0%
the revenue of tourists and visitors who
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
flock to our many attractions and events
 
01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you right now my friends
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
who've come up here every year for
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
decades to attend Bike Week would
 
01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
certainly think twice about making that
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
Trek at a time when they may end up
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
stuck on the highway for hours and risk
 
01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:16.139 align:start position:0%
unreasonable searches on their ride
 
01:52:16.139 --> 01:52:18.350 align:start position:0%
unreasonable searches on their ride
there

01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
and those those times things like Bike
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
Week are exactly the times border patrol
 
01:52:26.330 --> 01:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
casts their very wide net
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
to their minds this is ideal
 
01:52:31.729 --> 01:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
now I'm not asking for immigration
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
checkpoints to end what I am asking is
 
01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:36.659 align:start position:0%
for our state police to notify simply
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
notify the public in a post in a tweet
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
really however they choose
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
when they are made aware of a potential
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
imposition on the good people of New
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on their behalf in mine please
 
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
join me in passing this very simple
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
straightforward request for common
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
courtesy from our law enforcement
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I requested division book
 
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:09.410 --> 01:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
I Rise also in support of this bill and
 
01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sharing my personal story
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
because this could happen to any of us
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
or any of your kids
 
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
um my father worked for the U.S
 
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
government for usaid when I was born he
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
was stationed in Pakistan so my first
 
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
passport photos were taken when I was 10
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
hours old
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
I've been through an immigration
 
01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
checkpoint they asked to see my license
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
then they asked me where I was born
 
01:53:33.649 --> 01:53:33.659 align:start position:0%
then they asked me to pull to the side
 
01:53:35.090 --> 01:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
of the road so we could have a further
 
01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.410 align:start position:0%
of the road so we could have a further
discussion

01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
I was there for quite a while
 
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
wasted my time wasted their time it
 
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
caused a huge traffic line from all the
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
people waiting for me to finish
 
01:53:47.229 --> 01:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
answering their questions
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
inconvenienced a lot of people because
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
my father worked for the U.S government
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
when I was born
 
01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:54.590 align:start position:0%
when I was born
so

01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
I ask you to vote in support of this
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill of notification because if I know
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
that for example I'm going up to North
 
01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
Conway to go shopping or if I know I'm
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
going up to Waterville to go skiing
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
although I don't choose to ski there but
 
01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
if I knew I were going there to ski and
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
I knew that there was going to be an
 
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
immigration checkpoint I would know to
 
01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:16.860 align:start position:0%
include my passport in my car that day
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
to save both myself and the immigration
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
authorities an awful lot of time
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
so I ask you on behalf of myself and on
 
01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
behalf of any of your kids who it could
 
01:54:29.570 --> 01:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
be to vote in support of this Bill thank
 
01:54:29.580 --> 01:55:44.689 align:start position:0%
be to vote in support of this Bill thank
you

01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.699 --> 01:56:02.410 align:start position:0%
 
immediately

01:56:02.410 --> 01:56:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative tensile are you in the
 
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:20.990 align:start position:0%
representative tensile are you in the
room

01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Speaker I apologize to
 
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
my concession once I wasn't aware I was
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking I am if I know that
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
it's not appearing I
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
again sorry I wasn't aware I was
 
01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.970 --> 01:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
but my speech is going to be very short
 
01:57:28.010 --> 01:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
I am against the ought to pass on this
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.169 --> 01:57:51.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker this is
 
01:57:53.530 --> 01:57:53.540 align:start position:0%
a bill that has been before us
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
in several other sessions this is a bill
 
01:57:59.810 --> 01:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
that the house has generally looked
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
pretty kindly on there really is nothing
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill that keeps anybody in law
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement from from doing their job
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that keeps border patrol
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
officers from doing their job in the
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
bill all it really does is require
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
notification of a process that can
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
present a huge inconvenience for people
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
who live in the area and for a lot of
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
the people who fuel the economy of the
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
North country
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh so essentially what it does is it

of Customs and Border Patrol to actually

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
if I believe that the United States is a
 
02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
Sovereign Nation I would oppose house
 
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
bill 624.
 
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
if I believe that the goal of House Bill
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
624 is to stem the flow of illegal drugs
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
and guns coming into our country I would
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
oppose house bill 624.
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
if I believe that advance notice of a
 
02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
checkpoint would defeat the purpose of
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
having a checkpoint I would oppose house
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
bill 624.
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%

agents are under attack daily and could
 
02:00:50.750 --> 02:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
use support in their duties I would
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 624 thank you and if
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
you support
 
02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:57.770 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill prevents Customs
 
02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
and Border Patrol officers from doing
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
their job or prevents local or state law
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
enforcement from assisting them
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
but if I also know that immigration
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
checkpoint stops can put an unreasonable
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
burden on local residents inconvenienced
 
02:01:29.450 --> 02:01:29.460 align:start position:0%

economy in Northern parts of the state
 
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
and are often used as a constitutionally
 
02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
questionable pretext for conducting

broader searches that may violate civil

02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
simply requires the public be notified

thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
so what do we know about New Hampshire's
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
brand new education Freedom account
 
02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:43.310 align:start position:0%
brand new education Freedom account
program

02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
well we know it was highly unpopular
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
with granite Staters what
 
02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:50.219 align:start position:0%
when it was proposed two years ago more
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
than 5200 people signed in opposition to
 
02:04:53.159 --> 02:04:54.050 align:start position:0%
than 5200 people signed in opposition to
it

02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
and the bill didn't even get out of our
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee or have a vote on the house
 
02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:58.970 align:start position:0%
committee or have a vote on the house
floor

02:04:58.970 --> 02:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
floor
 
02:05:01.250 --> 02:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
and we know the program was designed to
 
02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
provide students from low-income
 
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
families an alternative to their Public
 
02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:07.070 align:start position:0%
families an alternative to their Public
School

02:05:07.070 --> 02:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
School
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
but turns out just about all the kids in
 
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
the program were already in private
 
02:05:13.129 --> 02:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
schools or home schools when they
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
applied for an EFA
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 367 now amended expands the
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
program to include families making more
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
than a hundred thousand dollars a year
 
02:05:27.410 --> 02:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
and now is not the time to expand this
 
02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:28.729 align:start position:0%
and now is not the time to expand this
program

02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
this coming fall the legislative budget
 
02:05:34.370 --> 02:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
office will provide will will conduct a
 
02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
performance audit on the program
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
currently the fa program has cost
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers almost 25 million dollars
 
02:05:44.089 --> 02:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner is asking for
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
another 60 million in taxpayer money to
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
pay private school costs over the next
 
02:05:50.290 --> 02:05:50.300 align:start position:0%
two years
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
expanding the program will reduce the
 
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
amount of funding available to our
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
Public Schools the schools we are
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
required to adequately fund for the New
 
02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution
 
02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
and when the state diverts money away
 
02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
from our Public Schools what happens
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's right it increases our property
 
02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:11.089 align:start position:0%
that's right it increases our property
taxes

02:06:11.089 --> 02:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:06:13.970 --> 02:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
bills like House Bill 367 are policy
 
02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:16.070 align:start position:0%
bills like House Bill 367 are policy
bills

02:06:16.070 --> 02:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:06:18.589 --> 02:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
but that also says a lot about our
 
02:06:18.599 --> 02:06:21.410 align:start position:0%
but that also says a lot about our
priorities

02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:23.629 --> 02:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
now is not the time to expand this
 
02:06:23.639 --> 02:06:24.589 align:start position:0%
now is not the time to expand this
program

02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
please consider the impact on the state
 
02:06:29.209 --> 02:06:29.219 align:start position:0%
budget and how that impact will limit
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
the state's ability to fund other
 
02:06:33.530 --> 02:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
priorities important to your
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%

public schools
 
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:40.440 align:start position:0%

property taxes
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
please vote no on the motion of ought to

02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
for their children the best possible
 
02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
education for their children like the
 
02:07:23.330 --> 02:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
little one we've been hearing from this
 
02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:25.010 align:start position:0%
little one we've been hearing from this
morning

02:07:25.010 --> 02:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is Empower parents to
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
provide children with those educational
 
02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:32.030 align:start position:0%
provide children with those educational
opportunities

02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
but we also know that there is an income
 
02:07:37.010 --> 02:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
cap for this program
 
02:07:38.689 --> 02:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment that we just
 
02:07:38.699 --> 02:07:39.729 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment that we just
passed

02:07:39.729 --> 02:07:39.739 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
increases by a small amount that family
 
02:07:44.089 --> 02:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
income limit
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
we might even say that it keeps up with
 
02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
the historic inflation that we've been
 
02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:51.290 align:start position:0%
the historic inflation that we've been
experiencing

02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony about hundreds of
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
families that have been denied access to
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
the program because of their income
 
02:08:04.729 --> 02:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
not just denying the family but denying
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
the education that that child and that
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
family needs to succeed
 
02:08:14.450 --> 02:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
currently a single mom with a child they
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
have an Inca income cap of under fifty
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars
 
02:08:21.649 --> 02:08:21.659 align:start position:0%
this amendment would increase that cap
 
02:08:25.070 --> 02:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
so that that Mom and her child could
 
02:08:28.250 --> 02:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
have an in an income of approximately
 
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
nine thousand dollars greater than they
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
do now
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
how many of those families would qualify
 
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know but we want to give them a
 
02:08:40.850 --> 02:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
chance we want to give the children a
 
02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:42.290 align:start position:0%
chance we want to give the children a
chance

02:08:42.290 --> 02:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
chance
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the impact of this program
 
02:08:48.169 --> 02:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
we heard that about the impact that this
 
02:08:49.850 --> 02:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
will have on the budget
 
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned about the impact in
 
02:08:53.689 --> 02:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
our kids
 
02:08:56.930 --> 02:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
we believe that the bill passage with
 
02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
this amendment has a great chance to get
 
02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
signed into law we ask you to give
 
02:09:05.810 --> 02:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
support to more New Hampshire children
 
02:09:07.729 --> 02:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
so that they can have the opportunity
 
02:09:12.050 --> 02:09:12.060 align:start position:0%

02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass as
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill 367. this is a
 
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:42.420 align:start position:0%

02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that according to
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education the EFA
 
02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
program was intended for students from
 
02:10:55.370 --> 02:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
low-income families
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill expands the
 
02:11:00.589 --> 02:11:00.599 align:start position:0%
EFA program to families making more than
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars a year
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
and if I know that expanding the EFA
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
program will limit the state's ability
 
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
to fund other programs important to
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
granted Staters then would I press the
 
02:11:14.689 --> 02:11:14.699 align:start position:0%

02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%

02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:27.780 align:start position:0%

percent of the federal poverty line to
 
02:11:36.169 --> 02:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
350 percent if I know Low Middle low and
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
middle income parents are using
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts to ensure
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%

education they deserve
 
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
and if I also know this program has
 
02:11:47.209 --> 02:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
exceeded expectations providing
 
02:11:49.010 --> 02:11:49.020 align:start position:0%

legislators for limited spending
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
about 1994 Along came a new member
 
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
called Paul palmersky
 
02:17:13.969 --> 02:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
and he was active in the group and after
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
a while he said
 
02:17:18.290 --> 02:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
your focus is too narrow
 
02:17:21.169 --> 02:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
we should be looking at the Constitution
 
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
and the party platform and a few weeks
 
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
later he formed a different group called
 
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
the house Republican Alliance
 
02:17:34.370 --> 02:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
and pretty soon I'll be LLS members went
 
02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
over to join that group as well and it
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
has been very active since since about
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%

02:17:46.690 --> 02:17:46.700 align:start position:0%
active group so I rise to memorialize
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
the gentleman Paul mursky who on
 
02:17:52.669 --> 02:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
February 19th departed this world he was
 
02:17:55.009 --> 02:17:55.019 align:start position:0%
one of the great influences in this body
 
02:17:58.310 --> 02:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
for the approximately 12 years that he
 
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
was here he has left a lasting Legacy
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
and he's had some good friends I would
 
02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:04.129 align:start position:0%
and he's had some good friends I would
ask

02:18:04.129 --> 02:18:04.139 align:start position:0%
ask
 
02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
let's see is Cliff Newton here
 
02:18:09.469 --> 02:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
I would ask him to make a few remarks
 
02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.209 --> 02:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Ken for that
 
02:18:20.290 --> 02:18:20.300 align:start position:0%
I uh knew Paul marsky for over 25 years
 
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
and my first served with him in 2002.
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
and in that time
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of things done we get a lot
 
02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
of the group together the HRA
 
02:18:36.349 --> 02:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
and Paul had a laugh that was as big as
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
the man himself
 
02:18:41.450 --> 02:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
and what I would need to catch up with
 
02:18:43.250 --> 02:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
Paul all I'd have to do was go in the
 
02:18:45.290 --> 02:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
hall or go on a floor of a room and if
 
02:18:46.849 --> 02:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
he was on that floor you'd hear him
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
because he'd laugh
 
02:18:51.169 --> 02:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
and I talked with him recently before he
 
02:18:55.129 --> 02:18:55.139 align:start position:0%
passed and he had still had that laugh
 
02:18:57.889 --> 02:18:57.899 align:start position:0%
Paul was also a rebel his favorite
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
saying was never ask for never asked for
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me it's easier to beg for
 
02:19:08.330 --> 02:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
forgiveness and ask for permission
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
and Paul was telling the story about his
 
02:19:14.650 --> 02:19:14.660 align:start position:0%
college days his parents had a store on
 
02:19:18.290 --> 02:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
I think it was uh it was a big lake up
 
02:19:19.790 --> 02:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
North Windham lake or something like
 
02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:20.810 align:start position:0%
North Windham lake or something like
that

02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
and his parents wanted to go on vacation
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
so they asked Paul who was in college
 
02:19:26.089 --> 02:19:26.099 align:start position:0%
they said can you come down and run the
 
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
store and you guys and your friends you
 
02:19:30.110 --> 02:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
can have whatever you want in the store
 
02:19:31.849 --> 02:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
to eat and drink
 
02:19:34.129 --> 02:19:34.139 align:start position:0%
and they say his father said just one
 
02:19:37.490 --> 02:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
thing he said don't feed the dogs
 
02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
so Paul being the rebel the store had a
 
02:19:43.129 --> 02:19:43.139 align:start position:0%
little that had a popcorn machine and
 
02:19:45.169 --> 02:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
every night to empty the popcorn machine
 
02:19:48.049 --> 02:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
what would he do he'd feed the Ducks
 
02:19:50.929 --> 02:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
so when his parents come back his father
 
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
gets out of the car and there's hundreds
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
of ducks on the lawn
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
and his father looks at him and all he
 
02:19:59.330 --> 02:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
says is
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
you fed the docks didn't you
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
so I can't help but hope that Paul is
 
02:20:07.490 --> 02:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
somewhere still feeding the Ducks
 
02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
and still being a little bit of a rebel
 
02:20:13.390 --> 02:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:17.050 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

02:20:17.050 --> 02:20:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.359 --> 02:20:40.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:20:40.730 --> 02:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:49.809 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

02:20:49.809 --> 02:20:49.819 align:start position:0%

um

02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:12.410 --> 02:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to take lunch let's meet
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%

03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes

03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
members take his seats the house will be

03:34:04.330 --> 03:34:04.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues I rise in
 
03:34:10.729 --> 03:34:10.739 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill free 80.
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
current statute ensures that surveys are
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
conducted on a volunteer basis the
 
03:34:20.450 --> 03:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
opt-in policy ensures that no one
 
03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
participates unwillingly and no one is
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
pressured into participating
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
changing this to opt out makes parents
 
03:34:34.190 --> 03:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
less aware of what is going on inside
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
03:34:38.929 --> 03:34:38.939 align:start position:0%
it is imperative that parents can easily
 
03:34:42.050 --> 03:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
choose for their students not to be
 
03:34:42.060 --> 03:34:43.570 align:start position:0%
choose for their students not to be
surveyed

03:34:43.570 --> 03:34:43.580 align:start position:0%
surveyed
 
03:34:46.870 --> 03:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
also there are New Hampshire students
 
03:34:48.889 --> 03:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
underperforming on the Statewide
 
03:34:53.469 --> 03:34:53.479 align:start position:0%
assessment therefore we should we must
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
prioritize academic Improvement and not
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
decrease instructional time to perform
 
03:35:04.510 --> 03:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
unwanted surveys that provide no
 
03:35:07.250 --> 03:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
academic benefit
 
03:35:09.290 --> 03:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
the survey mentioned by name within
 
03:35:12.170 --> 03:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
houseboat free 80 is the youth risk
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
behavior survey which has been conducted
 
03:35:20.210 --> 03:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
biannually by the CDC since 1991.
 
03:35:23.690 --> 03:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
while in high school I took this survey
 
03:35:23.700 --> 03:35:25.429 align:start position:0%
while in high school I took this survey
twice

03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
twice
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
the questions are direct and invasive by
 
03:35:31.190 --> 03:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
Design asking about sensitive topics
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
such as abuse neglect drugs rape and
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
suicide to name only a few
 
03:35:42.050 --> 03:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
after completing the survey there is not
 
03:35:45.410 --> 03:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to discuss these topics even
 
03:35:47.929 --> 03:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
though students who feel embarrassed
 
03:35:50.590 --> 03:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
scared and uncomfortable
 
03:35:52.969 --> 03:35:52.979 align:start position:0%
need support
 
03:35:55.250 --> 03:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
not surveys
 
03:35:58.190 --> 03:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore the validity of aggregated
 
03:36:01.849 --> 03:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
data must be considered
 
03:36:05.330 --> 03:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
survey results lack credibility because
 
03:36:07.429 --> 03:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
of a lack of honesty
 
03:36:10.969 --> 03:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
for example underage substance use is a
 
03:36:13.690 --> 03:36:13.700 align:start position:0%
commonly committed crime but likely
 
03:36:16.130 --> 03:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
underrepresented in the data
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
there are even students who think it is
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
cool to intentionally skew survey
 
03:36:22.620 --> 03:36:23.929 align:start position:0%
cool to intentionally skew survey
results

03:36:23.929 --> 03:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
results
 
03:36:26.690 --> 03:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
therefore conclusions made from
 
03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
falsified data should be considered
 
03:36:29.880 --> 03:36:32.929 align:start position:0%
falsified data should be considered
misinformation

03:36:32.929 --> 03:36:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:36.650 --> 03:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
finally houseboat free 80 would apply to
 
03:36:39.889 --> 03:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
Future surveys that we do not at the
 
03:36:43.610 --> 03:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
present time know the content of
 
03:36:46.849 --> 03:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
so please join me in opposing the OTP
 
03:36:49.790 --> 03:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
motion because people are not
 
03:36:53.090 --> 03:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
percentages and should not be subjected
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
to unwanted surveys for the sake of
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
collecting inaccurate data
 
03:37:02.210 --> 03:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:03.889 --> 03:37:03.899 align:start position:0%
the chair the chair recognizes
 
03:37:10.630 --> 03:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:13.070 --> 03:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh good afternoon welcome
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
back for lunch
 
03:37:16.849 --> 03:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
how many times have we sat in this Hall
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
and heard the statement this bill isn't
 
03:37:22.729 --> 03:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time it needs more work
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
where the committee needs more data
 
03:37:28.849 --> 03:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
just this session think back on your own
 
03:37:31.010 --> 03:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
committee votes and how you may have
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
concluded with a statement we need more
 
03:37:36.050 --> 03:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
data we need more information then you
 
03:37:38.330 --> 03:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
vote to itl or retain the bill because
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have it
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
this isn't a fancy bill it's not the
 
03:37:44.690 --> 03:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
youth risk be her behavior survey that's
 
03:37:47.210 --> 03:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
in law it's not what we just heard it
 
03:37:49.490 --> 03:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't die on the table as an unfunded
 
03:37:52.010 --> 03:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
mandate there are no hidden agendas or
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences lurking in the
 
03:37:54.239 --> 03:37:55.190 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences lurking in the
shadows

03:37:55.190 --> 03:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
shadows
 
03:37:58.010 --> 03:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
it simply does a couple of things in

03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill is very simple
 
03:38:34.969 --> 03:38:34.979 align:start position:0%
expand data collection to Charter
 
03:38:37.250 --> 03:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
Schools and increase participation in
 
03:38:39.410 --> 03:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
all public schools so by using the
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
opt-out system versus an opt-in
 
03:38:44.330 --> 03:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
researchers know that the more data
 
03:38:46.190 --> 03:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
collected yields more results and
 
03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
provides better opportunities to make
 
03:38:50.809 --> 03:38:50.819 align:start position:0%
more accurate recommendations thereby
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
improving the effectiveness of programs
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%

03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
03:48:41.690 --> 03:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
currently there are three thousand two
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
hundred students receiving an EFA
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
voucher at a cost of 20 million dollars
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
the governor has proposed 60 million
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
dollars in this next biennium
 
03:48:58.429 --> 03:48:58.439 align:start position:0%
as you can see the funds for the EFA
 
03:48:58.439 --> 03:48:59.570 align:start position:0%
as you can see the funds for the EFA
program

03:48:59.570 --> 03:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:49:02.510 --> 03:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
are growing by the Millions
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
even though servicing just three to four
 
03:49:07.969 --> 03:49:07.979 align:start position:0%
thousand students
 
03:49:11.150 --> 03:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
the program deserves its own designated
 
03:49:13.610 --> 03:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
budget item
 
03:49:16.610 --> 03:49:16.620 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund was established
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
to provide needed State financial aid to
 
03:49:23.210 --> 03:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
local public schools to support an
 
03:49:25.969 --> 03:49:25.979 align:start position:0%
adequate education for over a hundred
 
03:49:29.650 --> 03:49:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
hb440 would take needed funding from the
 
03:49:38.090 --> 03:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
EFA away from the trust fund
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
to add this funding for the EFA program
 
03:49:44.929 --> 03:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund threatens
 
03:49:48.349 --> 03:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
the amount of taxpayer trust funded
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
dollars to local school districts
 
03:49:51.359 --> 03:49:52.729 align:start position:0%
dollars to local school districts
further

03:49:52.729 --> 03:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:49:56.210 --> 03:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
there is currently little accountability
 
03:50:00.110 --> 03:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
on the allocation of taxpayer dollars to
 
03:50:02.210 --> 03:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
the EFA program
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
by designating a specific budget item
 
03:50:08.690 --> 03:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
for the EFA program the millions of
 
03:50:11.389 --> 03:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
dollars devoted to the program will not
 
03:50:14.330 --> 03:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
get lost in the many education
 
03:50:17.090 --> 03:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
department of education programs
 
03:50:20.450 --> 03:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a stated budget limit
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
to the allocation of the EFA vouchers
 
03:50:26.690 --> 03:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
some project that the EFA program May
 
03:50:30.170 --> 03:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
exceed 70 million dollars
 
03:50:32.090 --> 03:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
we need to remember that every dollar
 
03:50:35.330 --> 03:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
expended from the education trust fund
 
03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
is a dollar that will not go to the
 
03:50:40.490 --> 03:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid to your local school
 
03:50:40.500 --> 03:50:41.389 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid to your local school
district

03:50:41.389 --> 03:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:50:44.990 --> 03:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
and could eventually raise taxpayer
 
03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:47.570 align:start position:0%
and could eventually raise taxpayer
dollars

03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:50.450 --> 03:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
the EFA program needs its own budget
 
03:50:52.490 --> 03:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
separate from the trust fund
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund needs to remain
 
03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the funding of adequate
 
03:50:59.330 --> 03:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
education for the 160 000 New Hampshire
 
03:51:01.729 --> 03:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
students attending Public Schools
 
03:51:03.889 --> 03:51:03.899 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote no
 
03:51:08.570 --> 03:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
on the OTP motion of hb440 so that an
 
03:51:11.210 --> 03:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
alternative motion can be made and Mr
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
Speaker I'd request a division vote
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
care recognized representative cordelli
 
03:51:20.889 --> 03:51:20.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
let me tell you really what this bill
 
03:51:23.279 --> 03:51:24.410 align:start position:0%
let me tell you really what this bill
does

03:51:24.410 --> 03:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
HB 440 clarifies the intent of the
 
03:51:29.690 --> 03:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
general court with respect to the
 
03:51:32.389 --> 03:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the education trust
 
03:51:37.130 --> 03:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
fund was set up in 1999 and specified
 
03:51:40.370 --> 03:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
specific uses including Distributing the
 
03:51:43.130 --> 03:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
education grants to schools
 
03:51:45.530 --> 03:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
since that time a number of programs
 
03:51:47.650 --> 03:51:47.660 align:start position:0%
have been signed into the law
 
03:51:50.330 --> 03:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
specifying use of the education trust
 
03:51:53.210 --> 03:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
fund these include infrastructure grants
 
03:51:55.190 --> 03:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
and kindergarten grants to
 
03:51:55.200 --> 03:51:56.809 align:start position:0%
and kindergarten grants to
municipalities

03:51:56.809 --> 03:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:52:00.309 --> 03:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
those statutes specifically
 
03:52:03.170 --> 03:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
addressed the education trust fund as
 
03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
the source of funding for those grants
 
03:52:09.170 --> 03:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
two years ago the education Freedom
 
03:52:11.750 --> 03:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
account program was created and put into
 
03:52:15.250 --> 03:52:15.260 align:start position:0%
law stating specifically let me quote
 
03:52:17.570 --> 03:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the education trust
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
fund the amount necessary to fund any
 
03:52:22.670 --> 03:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
grants or transfers authorized under
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
this chapter is hereby appropriated to
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
the department from the education trust
 
03:52:28.680 --> 03:52:30.130 align:start position:0%
the department from the education trust
fund

03:52:30.130 --> 03:52:30.140 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
HP 440 adds efas and these other
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
programs as authorized uses of the
 
03:52:40.250 --> 03:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
03:52:42.889 --> 03:52:42.899 align:start position:0%
due to oversight
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund statute was
 
03:52:52.190 --> 03:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
never updated to include these programs
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
but isn't it interesting that during
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
testimony the only one of these programs
 
03:53:00.889 --> 03:53:00.899 align:start position:0%
that was objected to was the education
 
03:53:04.729 --> 03:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts as we've just heard is
 
03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
it possible that this is really just
 
03:53:10.510 --> 03:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
another attempt to
 
03:53:14.330 --> 03:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
attack the education Freedom accounts
 
03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
there are two legal principles in play
 
03:53:17.220 --> 03:53:18.170 align:start position:0%
there are two legal principles in play
here

03:53:18.170 --> 03:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:53:18.180 --> 03:53:19.490 align:start position:0%
here
first

03:53:19.490 --> 03:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:53:21.650 --> 03:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
and we've heard it before
 
03:53:24.650 --> 03:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
one legislature cannot find a future
 
03:53:24.660 --> 03:53:26.090 align:start position:0%
one legislature cannot find a future
legislature

03:53:26.090 --> 03:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:53:30.170 --> 03:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
thus the 1999 legislature which defined
 
03:53:32.210 --> 03:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
the uses of the education trust fund
 
03:53:36.469 --> 03:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
cannot find the 2021 legislature that
 
03:53:38.809 --> 03:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
created the EFA account
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
and said that EFA
 
03:53:43.370 --> 03:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
funds are to come from the education
 
03:53:46.070 --> 03:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund secondly
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
in 2012 the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
heard a case involving the Wolfeboro
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
firefighters versus the town
 
03:53:58.429 --> 03:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
in that case there were two statutes in
 
03:53:58.439 --> 03:53:59.690 align:start position:0%
in that case there were two statutes in
conflict

03:53:59.690 --> 03:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
03:54:02.090 --> 03:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
that when there are two statutes in
 
03:54:08.929 --> 03:54:08.939 align:start position:0%
Conflict the later statute controls in
 
03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
this case the EFA statute
 
03:54:16.729 --> 03:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
this I'm afraid is just another attempt
 
03:54:19.550 --> 03:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
to mean as a means to sabotage the
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts
 
03:54:24.650 --> 03:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
and the kids in the program
 
03:54:28.370 --> 03:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
vote uh green please and Mr Speaker I
 
03:54:32.570 --> 03:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:34.490 --> 03:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
Senator cordelli has requested a roll
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
call vote as that's sufficiently second
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
that it is sufficiently seconded this
 
03:54:40.250 --> 03:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
will be a roll call vote members take
 
03:55:27.170 --> 03:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill 440. this will be a roll call
 
03:55:34.429 --> 03:55:34.439 align:start position:0%
vote the chair recognizes
 
03:55:36.170 --> 03:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
representatives cascadden for a
 
03:55:40.210 --> 03:55:40.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
if I know that there are 3 200 students
 
03:55:49.389 --> 03:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
receiving education Freedom accounts
 
03:55:53.090 --> 03:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
vouchers costing 120 million dollars
 
03:55:55.490 --> 03:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
and the proposed rate for the taxpayer
 
03:55:58.849 --> 03:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
funded voucher was originally for 25
 
03:56:02.450 --> 03:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
students at a cost of 129
 
03:56:02.460 --> 03:56:03.170 align:start position:0%
students at a cost of 129
000

03:56:03.170 --> 03:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
000
 
03:56:05.090 --> 03:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
then wouldn't we propose a separate
 
03:56:07.969 --> 03:56:07.979 align:start position:0%
state budget line item
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
if I know that there's a dire need to
 
03:56:14.809 --> 03:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
fund Public Schools would I not allocate
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
property tax dollars for that purpose
 
03:56:21.769 --> 03:56:21.779 align:start position:0%
and if I know that there is little to no
 
03:56:24.290 --> 03:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability of our
 
03:56:27.050 --> 03:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
local property tax dollars funding
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account programs what
 
03:56:35.090 --> 03:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
I now vote no by pushing the red button
 
03:56:36.590 --> 03:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative
 
03:56:40.910 --> 03:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:44.330 --> 03:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
know that this bill is necessary to
 
03:56:48.530 --> 03:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
update the statute for the use of the
 
03:56:51.170 --> 03:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and if I know that
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
one statute cannot violate another and
 
03:56:56.210 --> 03:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
if I know that when a conflict exists
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
between two statutes the latter statute
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
will control and above all
 
03:57:03.769 --> 03:57:03.779 align:start position:0%
this is a really boring bill because all

the education Freedom account or EFA

program is in its second year of

program is in its second year of
operation

03:58:47.150 --> 03:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
operation
 
03:58:50.510 --> 03:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
and started out with an income limit of
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
300 percent of poverty which was about
 
03:58:55.610 --> 03:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
ninety thousand dollars today we just
 
03:58:58.729 --> 03:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
entertained a bill that raised it to 350
 
03:59:01.610 --> 03:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
000 which stretches that limit up to
 
03:59:03.229 --> 03:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
almost a hundred thousand dollars for a
 
03:59:04.670 --> 03:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
family of four
 
03:59:07.849 --> 03:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
the initial intent of the program was to
 
03:59:09.889 --> 03:59:09.899 align:start position:0%
provide school choice for low-income
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
families to send their children to
 
03:59:14.689 --> 03:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
private and home school as an
 
03:59:17.570 --> 03:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
alternative Choice from a public school
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
families whose children were already
 
03:59:21.530 --> 03:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
attending private or parochial schools
 
03:59:24.170 --> 03:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
or were home schools immediately took
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of this new program
 
03:59:29.330 --> 03:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
their numbers were unknown when the
 
03:59:32.090 --> 03:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
final initial final statement physical
 
03:59:35.210 --> 03:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
statement was made and only 20 to 25
 
03:59:37.250 --> 03:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
percent of the funds actually went to
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
the students leaving the public schools
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's why there was such a discrepancy
 
03:59:44.450 --> 03:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
the resulting cost of the program was
 
03:59:46.729 --> 03:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
grossly underestimated both in the
 
03:59:48.889 --> 03:59:48.899 align:start position:0%
number of the students and the resulting
 
03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
amount of money that would be taken from
 
03:59:53.809 --> 03:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
the educational trust fund there's still
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
no budget cap to the allocations to the
 
03:59:59.330 --> 03:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
afo EFA program
 
04:00:02.090 --> 04:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes new eligibility for
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
the FAA program with no income
 
04:00:08.269 --> 04:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
requirement by extending eligibility to
 
04:00:10.849 --> 04:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
include groups of students who were in
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
various categories and situations
 
04:00:16.250 --> 04:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
the families of these children are from
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
situations like foster care
 
04:00:21.410 --> 04:00:21.420 align:start position:0%

04:00:24.769 --> 04:00:24.779 align:start position:0%
children English language Learners and
 
04:00:26.689 --> 04:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
more categories which would now be
 
04:00:30.170 --> 04:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive EFA funding without
 
04:00:30.180 --> 04:00:31.550 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive EFA funding without
any

04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
income limit
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
the number of students in these
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
categories would be added to the program
 
04:00:40.969 --> 04:00:40.979 align:start position:0%
and the number is totally unknown
 
04:00:43.490 --> 04:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
what we do know is that these are the
 
04:00:45.050 --> 04:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
very students who would greatly benefit
 
04:00:47.870 --> 04:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
from the expanded Services they could
 
04:00:50.330 --> 04:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
receive in the public school system the
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
private and parochial schools are not
 
04:00:54.530 --> 04:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
required and in many cases do not have
 
04:00:57.410 --> 04:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
the research sources to offer
 
04:01:00.050 --> 04:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
these vulnerable students and their
 
04:01:02.929 --> 04:01:02.939 align:start position:0%
families need a strong safety net meals
 
04:01:04.370 --> 04:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
basic needs
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
specialized school programs and
 
04:01:09.469 --> 04:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
Specialists community services and the
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
inclusive and nurturing culture found in
 
04:01:14.269 --> 04:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
local communities Public Schools
 
04:01:16.729 --> 04:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
to make such drastic changes in the
 
04:01:18.969 --> 04:01:18.979 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the efas at this point
 
04:01:22.610 --> 04:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
by expanding to an unknown number of new
 
04:01:26.570 --> 04:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
students without any new income limits
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
or a cap on the total amount will once
 
04:01:32.570 --> 04:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
again balloon the costs of the program
 
04:01:35.330 --> 04:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
we should think long and hard before we
 
04:01:38.210 --> 04:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
expand the EFA program and its effects
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
on our educational trust funds at this
 
04:01:43.370 --> 04:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
point because adequate funding for our
 
04:01:45.530 --> 04:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
Public Schools needs to be this
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
legislature's top priority
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
I requested division vote please and I

afternoon

04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
I want to ask you to go on a little
 
04:02:18.050 --> 04:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
imaginary trip with me
 
04:02:19.969 --> 04:02:19.979 align:start position:0%
who's your imagination
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
so imagine for a moment that you've
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
showed up as a new rep
 
04:02:28.010 --> 04:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
and you've gone through all the things
 
04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
necessary to get elected and here you
 
04:02:30.120 --> 04:02:30.889 align:start position:0%
necessary to get elected and here you
are

04:02:30.889 --> 04:02:30.899 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:02:32.809 --> 04:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
and you get your first bill and you're
 
04:02:35.150 --> 04:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
looking at it and it's like
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
you can't really it's like it's all in
 
04:02:39.889 --> 04:02:39.899 align:start position:0%
code and you can't figure it out
 
04:02:43.969 --> 04:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
so you ask and you're told now this is
 
04:02:46.189 --> 04:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
how you read these bills and this is the
 
04:02:47.689 --> 04:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
word you're really going to want to know
 
04:02:50.570 --> 04:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
shall shall make sure you know this see
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
it looks like this memorize this this is
 
04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
what it looks like okay so you think you
 
04:02:58.309 --> 04:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
got that one and the first bill comes up
 
04:02:59.630 --> 04:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
and you still can't
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
decode this but all right
 
04:03:04.429 --> 04:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
you've learned look at the pictures
 
04:03:06.650 --> 04:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
there aren't any pictures
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
you've learned listen to what other
 
04:03:10.370 --> 04:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
people are saying well they're saying
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
things they're talking about schools and
 
04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're talking about students and
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're talking about discipline and
 
04:03:18.530 --> 04:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
you've read the bill and it's got this
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
word that says Lash
 
04:03:20.640 --> 04:03:22.070 align:start position:0%
word that says Lash
Lash

04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
Lash
 
04:03:22.080 --> 04:03:23.510 align:start position:0%
Lash
okay

04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have that other word that
 
04:03:27.530 --> 04:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
word the other word they told you that
 
04:03:29.450 --> 04:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
said May
 
04:03:31.250 --> 04:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's the other important one challenge
 
04:03:31.260 --> 04:03:32.630 align:start position:0%
that's the other important one challenge
May

04:03:32.630 --> 04:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
May
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
well this other bill has this word
 
04:03:38.210 --> 04:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
that says
 
04:03:38.220 --> 04:03:40.610 align:start position:0%
that says
yam

04:03:40.610 --> 04:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
yam
 
04:03:43.610 --> 04:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense
 
04:03:46.610 --> 04:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
but lash is teachers
 
04:03:46.620 --> 04:03:48.590 align:start position:0%
but lash is teachers
and

04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
discipline lash are we going back to
 
04:03:53.570 --> 04:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
lashing students so you speak out
 
04:03:53.580 --> 04:03:55.070 align:start position:0%
lashing students so you speak out
because

04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:03:57.170 --> 04:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
we're now going to be lashing students
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
lashing students and everybody
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
and and you say that and now they're
 
04:04:04.370 --> 04:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
making fun of you you show up at the
 
04:04:06.530 --> 04:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
cafeteria and what's going on you show
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
up at the cafeteria and they're calling
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
you lash and you hear your name coming
 
04:04:14.450 --> 04:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
up and now this is your suspend I
 
04:04:16.010 --> 04:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
we're kind of getting a little off base
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
here on
 
04:04:21.769 --> 04:04:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:24.530 --> 04:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
trying to explain the situation of the
 
04:04:26.570 --> 04:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
children in our schools
 
04:04:31.969 --> 04:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
so you're a student and you don't get it
 
04:04:37.729 --> 04:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
and it's not working and you go to your
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
teacher and it's not working and they
 
04:04:42.410 --> 04:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
say I told you read from left to right
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
hold your hands like this the one that
 
04:04:48.590 --> 04:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
makes the L and you go they're all L to
 
04:04:50.330 --> 04:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
me I don't get it
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
but you're still not getting help and
 
04:04:54.050 --> 04:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
now the kids are making fun of you
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:02.269 --> 04:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
what's this got to do with the bill
 
04:05:04.729 --> 04:05:04.739 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it has to do with bullying
 
04:05:07.969 --> 04:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
and special needs the representative
 
04:05:11.450 --> 04:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
the member was raised the point of order
 
04:05:13.610 --> 04:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
State your point of order yeah yeah I I
 
04:05:17.210 --> 04:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
believe we've veered way off of the
 
04:05:21.469 --> 04:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
content of of this of this bill which is
 
04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
basically to um to remove any income
 
04:05:27.410 --> 04:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility for certain groups of
 
04:05:29.929 --> 04:05:29.939 align:start position:0%
students uh who apply for the education
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
the member kneels to really needs to
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
concentrate on the bill itself not
 
04:05:50.929 --> 04:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
our kids with special needs
 
04:05:57.889 --> 04:05:57.899 align:start position:0%
and kids who are being persistently
 
04:05:57.899 --> 04:05:59.450 align:start position:0%
and kids who are being persistently
bullied

04:05:59.450 --> 04:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
bullied
 
04:06:03.650 --> 04:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:06.110 --> 04:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
those kids go to their parents and they
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
say can't I get out
 
04:06:10.490 --> 04:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
a mandated to go here and the parents
 
04:06:12.349 --> 04:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
say I don't have enough money
 
04:06:16.370 --> 04:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
and the kids say well but so and so we
 
04:06:18.769 --> 04:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
have more money than they do
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
and the kids you know well yeah but they
 
04:06:24.349 --> 04:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
have helped the state pays for them
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
because they don't make much money the
 
04:06:29.090 --> 04:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
state isn't going to pay for us well so
 
04:06:30.830 --> 04:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
and so got help they went to this
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
special school and now they can read
 
04:06:36.830 --> 04:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but their parents have money
 
04:06:38.689 --> 04:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
but we have money we're not doing too
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
badly yeah but we have to fix the roof
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
and the car needs to be replaced
 
04:06:45.889 --> 04:06:45.899 align:start position:0%
and we don't have money and everything
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.490 --> 04:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
but guess what you still have to go to
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
that school we heard stories I can't
 
04:06:57.530 --> 04:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
tell you how many kids coming in
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
parents coming in their kids with belly
 
04:07:02.090 --> 04:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
aches throwing up in the morning
 
04:07:04.010 --> 04:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
anything to avoid going to school and
 
04:07:05.330 --> 04:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
being bullied again
 
04:07:07.490 --> 04:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense to them they can't
 
04:07:09.290 --> 04:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
decode the words they can't read it
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
makes no sense
 
04:07:13.010 --> 04:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
when Dad came and told us that story he
 
04:07:15.170 --> 04:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
said but I have money
 
04:07:17.090 --> 04:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
I took my kid out
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
I put him in a private school he's doing
 
04:07:23.389 --> 04:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
excellently and my son said to me Dad
 
04:07:25.849 --> 04:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
what about all those kids whose parents
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money
 
04:07:30.170 --> 04:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
are they still having to go through
 
04:07:31.969 --> 04:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
stuff like I did
 
04:07:34.610 --> 04:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
and he came and said I don't want an EFA
 
04:07:37.370 --> 04:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
for me I don't need it but I want an EFA
 
04:07:39.290 --> 04:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
for all those kids
 
04:07:41.809 --> 04:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
those kids who are being bullied those
 
04:07:43.550 --> 04:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
kids who just aren't getting it and
 
04:07:45.769 --> 04:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
aren't being reached by the the school
 
04:07:45.779 --> 04:07:46.910 align:start position:0%
aren't being reached by the the school
system

04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
I want them to be able to go to a school
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
that meets their needs a school that
 
04:07:53.090 --> 04:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
teaches them how to decode those words
 
04:07:55.729 --> 04:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
that make no sense to them
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what bilis is about
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
Mr bride stability for those kids who
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
are being moved all over the place so
 
04:08:05.269 --> 04:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
they can use their EFA to go to one
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
single school instead of being moved
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
every time they're in a new foster home
 
04:08:13.490 --> 04:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
or their parents get transferred
 
04:08:17.050 --> 04:08:17.060 align:start position:0%
that's what it's for it's for those kids
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I ask you we don't know where those
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
families are and we don't know where
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
that line is we don't know what they're
 
04:08:26.570 --> 04:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
going through but I ask you to support
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
those kids so they can get the help that
 
04:08:32.090 --> 04:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
the parents who have lots of money can
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
provide thank you so remember yield to
 
04:08:34.319 --> 04:08:36.170 align:start position:0%

04:08:44.450 --> 04:08:44.460 align:start position:0%

04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%

04:08:51.530 --> 04:08:51.540 align:start position:0%

04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
is is it true that this bill does much
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
like what we do in Medicaid where there
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
are Financial eligibility requirements
 
04:09:06.309 --> 04:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
to establish need as well as
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
categories in which people can qualify
 
04:09:12.769 --> 04:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
based on their need as well beyond just
 
04:09:16.010 --> 04:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
the financial I is it true that this
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
establishes some categories in which the
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
need of the student is as important as
 
04:09:27.170 --> 04:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
the financial wear with all of the
 
04:09:27.180 --> 04:09:31.849 align:start position:0%
the financial wear with all of the
parents

04:09:31.849 --> 04:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.610 --> 04:09:34.620 align:start position:0%

04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues and I must say it's a
 
04:11:48.410 --> 04:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be able to stand here and
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
say that
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill attempts to expand
 
04:11:54.370 --> 04:11:54.380 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts program
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
far beyond its original intent despite
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
the program lacking accountability
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
academically or fiscally
 
04:12:04.969 --> 04:12:04.979 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the budget for the
 
04:12:06.889 --> 04:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
program has already been exceeded by
 
04:12:09.229 --> 04:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars and making this
 
04:12:11.150 --> 04:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
drastic change in eligibility will
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
further balloon the cost of the program
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
without any limits on the cost to our
 
04:12:16.080 --> 04:12:17.330 align:start position:0%
without any limits on the cost to our
taxpayers

04:12:17.330 --> 04:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know that funding
 
04:12:23.929 --> 04:12:23.939 align:start position:0%
Public Schools adequately should be this
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislator's top educational priority
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to

thank you Mr Speaker I'm going to make
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
this very quick
 
04:25:20.210 --> 04:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
HP 112 would require the owner of a

restricted rental property and just so
 
04:25:23.870 --> 04:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
everyone knows restricted means four or
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
more units to give a 60-day notice to
 
04:25:28.610 --> 04:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
tenants that the landlord or housing
 
04:25:30.769 --> 04:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
provider intends to sell the property
 
04:25:32.689 --> 04:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
60 days is way too much time in this
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
housing market and it removes the
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
ability for a landlord to entertain any
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
cash offers because typically a cash
 
04:25:40.010 --> 04:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
offer you can close less than three
 
04:25:42.590 --> 04:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
weeks so further restricting the housing
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
Supply restricting rights of the
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
landlords uh to flip and sell their
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
property will exacerbate the housing
 
04:25:49.969 --> 04:25:49.979 align:start position:0%
crisis everyone knows the housing crisis
 
04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
is a supply side issue and further
 
04:25:54.170 --> 04:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
regulation would not solve it
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
so and just to clarify this committee
 
04:25:58.490 --> 04:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment now with this bill in place
 
04:26:00.530 --> 04:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
with the amendment not passing means
 
04:26:00.540 --> 04:26:01.610 align:start position:0%
with the amendment not passing means
that

04:26:01.610 --> 04:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:01.620 --> 04:26:02.330 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:26:02.330 --> 04:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:05.450 --> 04:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
the the owner has to give a good faith
 
04:26:07.729 --> 04:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
offer to the tenants and they have to
 
04:26:09.170 --> 04:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
entertain the offer from the tenants
 
04:26:10.969 --> 04:26:10.979 align:start position:0%
before they can accept any other offers
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
so with that energy committee to vote
 
04:26:15.170 --> 04:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
red things the house of all red thank
 
04:26:15.180 --> 04:26:17.269 align:start position:0%
red things the house of all red thank
you

04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
the member from Durham representative
 
04:26:20.389 --> 04:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
Kennedy has recognized to speak for the
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:26:29.149 --> 04:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
HP 112 would simply say that tenants
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
must be notified 60 days before the
 
04:26:34.670 --> 04:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
final sale of the building they live in
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
this applies only to restricted
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
multi-family buildings the kind that are
 
04:26:41.689 --> 04:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
owned by corporate landlords this does
 
04:26:44.530 --> 04:26:44.540 align:start position:0%
not apply to small private landlords
 
04:26:47.090 --> 04:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
renting out a single home or a couple
 
04:26:49.370 --> 04:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
adus or the like this is nothing more
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
than a right to know for the consumer
 
04:26:53.330 --> 04:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
the person renting
 
04:26:55.610 --> 04:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
currently prospective buyers will often
 
04:26:57.410 --> 04:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
jump through hoops to keep their
 
04:26:58.969 --> 04:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
purchase of the property a secret
 
04:27:01.729 --> 04:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
knowing that tenants simply simply knew
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
the truth about what was happening to
 
04:27:05.689 --> 04:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
the property they may make preparations
 
04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
including potentially using their free
 
04:27:10.849 --> 04:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
market ability to leave the committee
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from tenants at some
 
04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
prospective landlords in conjunction
 
04:27:16.610 --> 04:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
with the seller have inspected the
 
04:27:19.130 --> 04:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
property before a sale by claiming they
 
04:27:21.830 --> 04:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
were insurance adjusters others claim
 
04:27:23.630 --> 04:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
that they owned a neighboring property
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
and had questions about the property
 
04:27:25.199 --> 04:27:28.550 align:start position:0%
and had questions about the property
line

04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:30.349 --> 04:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
the majority of tenants in this state
 
04:27:32.750 --> 04:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
are month to month extensions of their
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
original lease a change in ownership
 
04:27:37.490 --> 04:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
might mean an immediate rent increase or
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
changes to a whole host of policies that
 
04:27:41.570 --> 04:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
have been in the month-to-month
 
04:27:41.580 --> 04:27:42.410 align:start position:0%
have been in the month-to-month
agreement

04:27:42.410 --> 04:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
but even for tenants who are still
 
04:27:46.370 --> 04:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
finishing out their lease at the time of
 
04:27:48.830 --> 04:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
transfer a new landlord can mean changes
 
04:27:51.050 --> 04:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
to aspects of the property that were not
 
04:27:54.170 --> 04:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
guaranteed in the lease
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
so the language of the original bill
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
came directly from current New Hampshire
 
04:28:02.450 --> 04:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
RSA in the 1980s New Hampshire passed a
 
04:28:04.910 --> 04:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
very similar law for the notice of sale
 
04:28:07.849 --> 04:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
in regard to mobile mobile home parks
 
04:28:11.689 --> 04:28:11.699 align:start position:0%
the law went further than this bill does
 
04:28:14.330 --> 04:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
or would have if amended
 
04:28:16.130 --> 04:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
the result of the law has been that
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
tenants were able to organize together
 
04:28:20.090 --> 04:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
and put in offers to buy their own
 
04:28:20.100 --> 04:28:21.590 align:start position:0%
and put in offers to buy their own
property

04:28:21.590 --> 04:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:28:23.229 --> 04:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
today we have
 
04:28:26.210 --> 04:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
189 successful community-owned mobile
 
04:28:29.210 --> 04:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
parks in the state as a result of that
 
04:28:29.220 --> 04:28:30.530 align:start position:0%
parks in the state as a result of that
law

04:28:30.530 --> 04:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
organizations that help tenants band
 
04:28:34.729 --> 04:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
together to get funding as Co-op have
 
04:28:37.550 --> 04:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
formed for this very reason
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
this change has been productive and as
 
04:28:41.990 --> 04:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
we have empowered the tenants with
 
04:28:43.849 --> 04:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
information at the beginning we turn
 
04:28:46.370 --> 04:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
tenants into the owners
 
04:28:48.469 --> 04:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
something that has across the board
 
04:28:51.769 --> 04:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
positive impacts on communities and not
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
only that but the sellers by including
 
04:28:55.729 --> 04:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
the tenants up front were able to get
 
04:28:57.889 --> 04:28:57.899 align:start position:0%
better offers for their properties
 
04:29:00.110 --> 04:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
meaning the changes are good for the
 
04:29:00.120 --> 04:29:01.010 align:start position:0%
meaning the changes are good for the
tenant

04:29:01.010 --> 04:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the sellers to conclude HP 112
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
simply says the landlord will notify
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
their tenants 60 days before the final
 
04:29:11.090 --> 04:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
sale the vast majority of Dales do not
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
close within 60 days anyway this is a
 
04:29:15.769 --> 04:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
completely non-honorous business
 
04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
practice that would simply uphold the
 
04:29:20.450 --> 04:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
basic right to know and good free market
 
04:29:22.910 --> 04:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
principles rather than keep people in
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
the dark about what is going to happen
 
04:29:26.929 --> 04:29:26.939 align:start position:0%
in their homes which is currently
 
04:29:29.809 --> 04:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
happening therefore I urge my colleagues
 
04:29:32.090 --> 04:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
to support the OTP motion thank you Mr
 
04:29:32.100 --> 04:29:34.070 align:start position:0%
to support the OTP motion thank you Mr
Speaker

04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stanton assassin was
 
04:29:37.729 --> 04:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call vote which is
 
04:29:39.530 --> 04:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
roll call vote members please take your
 
04:29:41.040 --> 04:30:24.290 align:start position:0%
roll call vote members please take your
seats

04:30:24.290 --> 04:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.689 --> 04:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion of ought
 
04:30:29.330 --> 04:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
to pass on House Bill 112 this is a roll
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
call vote
 
04:30:32.689 --> 04:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp is recognized for
 
04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.450 --> 04:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill requires the owner
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
to provide tenants with a notice of sale
 
04:30:53.750 --> 04:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the first writer refusal on purchase
 
04:30:55.610 --> 04:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
of the property
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that if less than the
 
04:31:01.210 --> 04:31:01.220 align:start position:0%
total participation by the tenants
 
04:31:03.469 --> 04:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
reduces the probability of their being
 
04:31:06.110 --> 04:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
able to obtain financing
 
04:31:08.809 --> 04:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
and if I know that an existing lease
 
04:31:12.050 --> 04:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
protects the tenants from eviction by
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
the new owner
 
04:31:15.710 --> 04:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
and if I know
 
04:31:18.649 --> 04:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
that this bill diminishes the property
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
rights of the owner would I then vote
 
04:31:21.840 --> 04:31:25.309 align:start position:0%
rights of the owner would I then vote
red

04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler is recognized for
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
04:31:36.649 --> 04:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
know that all HB 12 112 does is allowed
 
04:31:39.110 --> 04:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
tenants to know when their property is
 
04:31:40.969 --> 04:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
going to be changing hands and if I know
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
that this has been done for decades in
 
04:31:44.809 --> 04:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
this state with regard to mobile homes
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
with great success and if I know that in
 
04:31:49.969 --> 04:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
essence this is a basic right to know
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
Law Without which the free market cannot
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
work and the market is currently shifted
 
04:31:56.750 --> 04:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
in One Direction and finally if I know
 
04:31:59.689 --> 04:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
that not only is it far from onerous to
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
Simply inform people of what's happening
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
to their homes but it actually helps
 
04:32:05.689 --> 04:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
sellers get better offers when they
 
04:32:08.330 --> 04:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
include tenants in the process when how
 
04:32:11.570 --> 04:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
often dismiss potential buyers would I
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
now press the green button to agree with

04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion about to
 
04:32:21.469 --> 04:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 112 this is a roll
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
call vote if you're in favor you'll
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
press the green button if you're opposed

opportunity to vote
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of
 
04:33:14.109 --> 04:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
04:33:17.570 --> 04:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
175 in the affirmative 199 and the
 
04:33:19.970 --> 04:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
negative the motion fails what reason
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
does remember rise Mr Speaker I move in

on House Bill 112 are you ready for the

04:33:52.849 --> 04:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
the committee on Judiciary to which was
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
referred House Bill 170 in relative to
 
04:33:57.470 --> 04:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
the termination of tenancy at the
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
expiration of the tenancy or lease term
 
04:34:03.529 --> 04:34:03.539 align:start position:0%
comes to us without recommendation

good afternoon
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
so the landlord tenant bills you're
 
04:34:26.570 --> 04:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
going to hear today this is the real
 
04:34:26.580 --> 04:34:27.849 align:start position:0%
going to hear today this is the real
sleeper

04:34:27.849 --> 04:34:27.859 align:start position:0%
sleeper
 
04:34:30.609 --> 04:34:30.619 align:start position:0%
this bill will repeal
 
04:34:34.429 --> 04:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
hb117 will repeal a statute that is 38
 
04:34:35.590 --> 04:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
years old
 
04:34:38.689 --> 04:34:38.699 align:start position:0%
it came out of a study committee that
 
04:34:43.490 --> 04:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
the governors established in 1985 I just
 
04:34:45.769 --> 04:34:45.779 align:start position:0%
want to remind you that is when the
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
ozone hole was first discovered in
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
Antarctica Super Mario Brothers were
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
introduced and Ronald Reagan was
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
President so it's been around a long
 
04:34:57.230 --> 04:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
time and it's done a pretty good job
 
04:35:00.830 --> 04:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes it will remove the
 
04:35:04.369 --> 04:35:04.379 align:start position:0%
limited protections that tenants have
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
once they've established a tendency and
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
it only applies to larger landlords
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
people with four units or more
 
04:35:14.810 --> 04:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to commercial doesn't
 
04:35:18.010 --> 04:35:18.020 align:start position:0%
apply to owner occupied or vacation
 
04:35:21.769 --> 04:35:21.779 align:start position:0%
recreational boarding houses but it does
 
04:35:24.170 --> 04:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
require that at the end of a tenancy
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
which is 12 months or six months
 
04:35:28.369 --> 04:35:28.379 align:start position:0%
anything over six months that the
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
landlord can't just arbitrarily end the
 
04:35:33.650 --> 04:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
tenancy can evict the tenant has to have
 
04:35:36.410 --> 04:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
a good cause and good cause could be any
 
04:35:38.689 --> 04:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
legitimate business reason or some of
 
04:35:40.970 --> 04:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
the reasons that you know of or her bad
 
04:35:44.689 --> 04:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
tenant reasons not paying rent Etc
 
04:35:46.609 --> 04:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
so this has been around for a while in
 
04:35:49.310 --> 04:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
2005 the New Hampshire Supreme Court as
 
04:35:52.090 --> 04:35:52.100 align:start position:0%
is mentioned in the little um report
 
04:35:55.609 --> 04:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
upheld this law
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
and all the five justices voted yes they
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to uphold it one Justice said he
 
04:36:02.570 --> 04:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to uphold it for a different
 
04:36:02.580 --> 04:36:04.131 align:start position:0%
wanted to uphold it for a different
reason

04:36:04.131 --> 04:36:04.141 align:start position:0%
reason
 
04:36:04.141 --> 04:36:04.970 align:start position:0%
reason
um

04:36:04.970 --> 04:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:06.769 --> 04:36:06.779 align:start position:0%
in making that decision the Supreme
 
04:36:09.470 --> 04:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
Court said that if we repealed these
 
04:36:11.689 --> 04:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
statutes these protections good cause we
 
04:36:14.090 --> 04:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
would eviscerate the protections for the
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
tenants in these units
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
and some of the consequences that they
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
said relationships with friends and
 
04:36:22.970 --> 04:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
neighbors would be destroyed children
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
would have to change schools and there
 
04:36:26.449 --> 04:36:26.459 align:start position:0%
would be loss of support system for
 
04:36:30.289 --> 04:36:30.299 align:start position:0%
elderly so um I'd like you all to please
 
04:36:32.150 --> 04:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh vote
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
um against red of the OTP so that
 
04:36:37.131 --> 04:36:37.141 align:start position:0%
another emotion could be offered thank
 
04:36:37.141 --> 04:36:38.750 align:start position:0%
another emotion could be offered thank
you

04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%

04:36:42.051 --> 04:36:42.061 align:start position:0%
Lynn is recognized to speak in support
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:36:50.330 --> 04:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
colleagues in order to explain why the
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
enactment of hb-117 is important
 
04:36:55.849 --> 04:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
let me ask you all to participate in a
 
04:36:57.949 --> 04:36:57.959 align:start position:0%
brief quiz in which you answer to
 
04:37:00.170 --> 04:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
yourselves a single multiple choice
 
04:37:00.180 --> 04:37:01.929 align:start position:0%
yourselves a single multiple choice
question

04:37:01.929 --> 04:37:01.939 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:37:05.090 --> 04:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
assume you own a small you are a small
 
04:37:07.310 --> 04:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
landlord owning rental properties
 
04:37:10.429 --> 04:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps three or four units and you
 
04:37:13.250 --> 04:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
don't own you don't live in the property
 
04:37:15.650 --> 04:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
and one of your units is up for rent
 
04:37:18.410 --> 04:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
and you decide to rent the property to
 
04:37:22.010 --> 04:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
it to a tenant for say for for one year
 
04:37:24.170 --> 04:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
for say two thousand dollars
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
so now the question
 
04:37:28.689 --> 04:37:28.699 align:start position:0%
what's the term of the lease
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
a one year
 
04:37:34.570 --> 04:37:34.580 align:start position:0%
be forever
 
04:37:39.410 --> 04:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
see one year for the tenant but forever
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
for you as the landlord
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the answer is a one year seems
 
04:37:47.810 --> 04:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
obvious doesn't it I said the least
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
specifically says it is for one year so
 
04:37:51.529 --> 04:37:51.539 align:start position:0%
that must mean the term of the lease
 
04:37:53.631 --> 04:37:53.641 align:start position:0%
contract is one year right
 
04:37:53.641 --> 04:37:56.269 align:start position:0%
contract is one year right
wrong

04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
the answer under New Hampshire law as it
 
04:38:01.849 --> 04:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
now stands based on the 2005 Supreme
 
04:38:04.010 --> 04:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
Court decision that was referred to
 
04:38:06.830 --> 04:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
earlier is C
 
04:38:09.529 --> 04:38:09.539 align:start position:0%
the term of the lease contract is one
 
04:38:12.590 --> 04:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
year for the tenant but it is forever
 
04:38:14.810 --> 04:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
for the landlord
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
stop and think about that
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
a single contract has one meaning for
 
04:38:23.150 --> 04:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
one party to the contract but an
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
entirely different meaning for the other
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
party to the contract
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
this completely unprecedented violation
 
04:38:33.769 --> 04:38:33.779 align:start position:0%
of basic contract rights results from
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court's conclusion that the
 
04:38:37.970 --> 04:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
termination of a tenancy does not
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
constitute good cause for evicting a
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
tenant who does not want to leave
 
04:38:45.709 --> 04:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
the rationale for the Court's decision
 
04:38:48.650 --> 04:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
was that the landlord's contract rights
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
really are unimportant in the case of
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
restricted property because the only
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
thing the landlord should be concerned
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
about is getting paid and having a
 
04:38:59.810 --> 04:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
tenant who who does not damage the
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
property or disrupt any other tenants
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
therefore as long as the tenant does not
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
violate these requirements the tenant
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
can stay for as long as he or she wants
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
of course this rationale does not work
 
04:39:15.890 --> 04:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
both ways at the end of the lease the
 
04:39:17.631 --> 04:39:17.641 align:start position:0%
tenant is free to move out without any
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
adverse consequences whatsoever
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
the weakness of the Court's reasoning in
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
the case was pointed out in the
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
concurring opinion of Justice Joseph
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
Neto who I will note was a Democrat
 
04:39:32.029 --> 04:39:32.039 align:start position:0%
appointed to the court by Governor
 
04:39:32.039 --> 04:39:33.289 align:start position:0%

Shaheen
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
Justice Netto wrote and I quote
 
04:39:38.530 --> 04:39:38.540 align:start position:0%
under the majority's interpretation
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
lease Provisions purporting to limit the
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
lease to a specified duration have no
 
04:39:43.680 --> 04:39:44.390 align:start position:0%
lease to a specified duration have no
meaning

04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
the effect of the majority's
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
interpretation is to create a Perpetual
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
tenancy virtually a life interest in
 
04:39:54.350 --> 04:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
favor of a tenant of restricted property
 
04:39:58.368 --> 04:39:58.378 align:start position:0%
covered by the statute I do not believe
 
04:40:00.948 --> 04:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
that that was the intent of the landlord
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
tenant statutes
 
04:40:04.910 --> 04:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
the Court's decision was ostensibly made
 
04:40:07.850 --> 04:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
to protect Senate's rights in reality
 
04:40:11.090 --> 04:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
however the decision has the effect of
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
reducing the availability of housing to
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
those most like the who are most likely
 
04:40:17.390 --> 04:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
consider the landlord who must decide
 
04:40:22.250 --> 04:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
whether to rent to a tenant that appears
 
04:40:24.590 --> 04:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
questionable maybe the tenant has a
 
04:40:26.930 --> 04:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
spotty credit history or a contentious
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
personality that may mean he or she
 
04:40:31.130 --> 04:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
might have problems getting along with
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
other tenants
 
04:40:35.810 --> 04:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
if the landlord knows that a one-year
 
04:40:38.510 --> 04:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
lease means what he what it says he
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
might be willing to take a chance on
 
04:40:42.288 --> 04:40:42.298 align:start position:0%
that person knowing that the maximum
 
04:40:44.630 --> 04:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
period of exposure is one year
 
04:40:47.810 --> 04:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
but under the law as it now stands the
 
04:40:49.730 --> 04:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
landlord knows that if he rents the unit
 
04:40:52.190 --> 04:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
to the person he may be stuck with that
 
04:40:53.570 --> 04:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
person forever
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
as a result the landlord in all
 
04:40:57.530 --> 04:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
likelihood will decide not to take the
 
04:41:00.050 --> 04:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
risk which means that this person will
 
04:41:03.170 --> 04:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
not get the housing he or she needs
 
04:41:06.410 --> 04:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
the bill does contain an exception for
 
04:41:08.930 --> 04:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
very short-term leases of six months or
 
04:41:11.330 --> 04:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
less because in such cases there usually
 
04:41:14.090 --> 04:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
is an expectancy by both parties that
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
the Senate will be extended for at least
 
04:41:18.410 --> 04:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
the six-month period
 
04:41:21.410 --> 04:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
please restore the law to what it should
 
04:41:24.530 --> 04:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
mean that property rights are important
 
04:41:28.250 --> 04:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
that contracts mean what they say so
 
04:41:30.410 --> 04:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
that landlords are not discur and so
 
04:41:32.510 --> 04:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
that landlords are not discouraged from
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
renting to people who do not fit the
 
04:41:37.550 --> 04:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
model of the ideal tenant thank you and
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I respectfully ask for a
 
04:41:42.770 --> 04:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:44.930 --> 04:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion about to
 
04:41:47.448 --> 04:41:47.458 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 117 representative
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
Lynn requested to never mind
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Santa nostalzo requests a
 
04:41:54.770 --> 04:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
roll call vote which is sufficiently
 
04:41:56.570 --> 04:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
seconded there shall be a roll call vote
 
04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion about to
 
04:42:55.368 --> 04:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 117
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative Marjorie Smith is
 
04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:06.530 --> 04:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
I know
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
that state law requires that a landlord
 
04:43:17.090 --> 04:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
have good cause for eviction non-payment
 
04:43:18.530 --> 04:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
of rent
 
04:43:22.128 --> 04:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
substantial damage to the apartment or
 
04:43:24.890 --> 04:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
taking the apartment off the rental
 
04:43:28.850 --> 04:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
market or substantially renovating it
 
04:43:31.368 --> 04:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
if I know that the New Hampshire Supreme
 
04:43:31.378 --> 04:43:33.610 align:start position:0%
if I know that the New Hampshire Supreme
Court

04:43:33.610 --> 04:43:33.620 align:start position:0%
Court
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing that when judges are
 
04:43:36.480 --> 04:43:37.670 align:start position:0%
recognizing that when judges are
appointed

04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
04:43:41.208 --> 04:43:41.218 align:start position:0%
one hopes that they have forgotten the
 
04:43:43.788 --> 04:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
political party of the governor who
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
appointed them
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
if I know that the New Hampshire Supreme
 
04:43:51.110 --> 04:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
Court has ruled that expiration of Elise
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
is not good cause on its own
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
for eviction if I know that this bill
 
04:44:03.170 --> 04:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
denies tenants the protection of the New
 
04:44:06.410 --> 04:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's well constructed eviction
 
04:44:11.868 --> 04:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
law would I now press the red button so
 
04:44:14.448 --> 04:44:14.458 align:start position:0%
that another motion could be made thank
 
04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker
 
04:44:18.288 --> 04:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn is recognized for
 
04:44:22.010 --> 04:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.890 --> 04:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
04:44:27.170 --> 04:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
bill will correct the law to eliminate
 
04:44:29.690 --> 04:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
the situation whereby a lease provision
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
specifying its term is rendered a
 
04:44:35.448 --> 04:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
nullity for the landlord but is fully
 
04:44:37.368 --> 04:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
enforceable by the tenant
 
04:44:39.410 --> 04:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the court decision
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
that produced this result violates the
 
04:44:44.030 --> 04:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
contract and property rights of
 
04:44:47.150 --> 04:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate business people who provide a
 
04:44:48.830 --> 04:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
valuable public service by making
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
housing available to the public
 
04:44:53.628 --> 04:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the law as it now
 
04:44:55.850 --> 04:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
stands reduces the availability of
 
04:44:58.128 --> 04:44:58.138 align:start position:0%
housing to those who are likely to have
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
the most difficulty in securing housing
 
04:45:02.930 --> 04:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
then would I support OTP for this bill
 
04:45:05.570 --> 04:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
by Crest pressing the green button thank
 
04:45:08.090 --> 04:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion of ought
 
04:45:12.830 --> 04:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
to pass on House Bill 117 this is a roll
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
call vote if you're in favor you'll
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
press the green button if you're opposed
 
04:45:20.208 --> 04:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
you'll press the red button
 
04:45:25.250 --> 04:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
voting stations are open for 30 seconds
 
04:46:10.128 --> 04:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:10.138 --> 04:46:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
again

04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:24.050 --> 04:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
the ball members present had an
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote
 
04:46:27.530 --> 04:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
the house will attended the state of the
 
04:46:27.540 --> 04:46:29.510 align:start position:0%
the house will attended the state of the
vote

04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
211 having voted in the affirmative 157
 
04:46:51.410 --> 04:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:53.330 --> 04:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
the committee on Judiciary which was
 
04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
referred House Bill 401 relative to
 
04:46:58.610 --> 04:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
evictions based on the owner's intent to
 
04:47:00.650 --> 04:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
renovate the property comes to us
 
04:47:02.810 --> 04:47:02.820 align:start position:0%
without recommendation
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Marjorie Smith moves
 
04:47:09.410 --> 04:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.930 --> 04:47:10.940 align:start position:0%
the member from Londonderry
 
04:47:13.368 --> 04:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
representative Perez is recognized to
 
04:47:17.810 --> 04:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:20.690 --> 04:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:47:23.690 --> 04:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
I too will be very brief because House
 
04:47:27.890 --> 04:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
Bill 401 does not work
 
04:47:31.610 --> 04:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
when did we as legislators get into the
 
04:47:34.368 --> 04:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
business of controlling Property Owners
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
of their fundamental right to control
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
how and when they can renovate their
 
04:47:40.798 --> 04:47:43.250 align:start position:0%
how and when they can renovate their
property

04:47:43.250 --> 04:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:46.970 --> 04:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
when did we as legislators
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
decide we had the right to tell Property
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
Owners when they were allowed to rent
 
04:47:55.970 --> 04:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
their property
 
04:47:58.250 --> 04:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
this bill will both discourage
 
04:47:58.260 --> 04:48:00.050 align:start position:0%
this bill will both discourage
development

04:48:00.050 --> 04:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
development
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
and Rehabilitation of property
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
and upgrading individual Apartments
 
04:48:10.490 --> 04:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
both are needed to sustain economic
 
04:48:12.890 --> 04:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
growth in New Hampshire
 
04:48:16.430 --> 04:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
why would we possibly want to restrict
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
apartments from being able to being
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
available for a period of time
 
04:48:26.090 --> 04:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
when we have a critical housing shortage
 
04:48:31.670 --> 04:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
and why would we possibly want to find a
 
04:48:34.850 --> 04:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
landlord for putting his property up for
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
rent when it is ready
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
this makes no sense
 
04:48:43.070 --> 04:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is a lose-lose for all
 
04:48:43.080 --> 04:48:44.150 align:start position:0%
this bill is a lose-lose for all
involved

04:48:44.150 --> 04:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
involved
 
04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
the property owner as well as a
 
04:48:47.160 --> 04:48:48.650 align:start position:0%
the property owner as well as a
potential

04:48:48.650 --> 04:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
potential
 
04:48:54.110 --> 04:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:54.120 --> 04:48:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
against

04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:00.770 --> 04:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:03.050 --> 04:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
trust but verify
 
04:49:05.208 --> 04:49:05.218 align:start position:0%
the representative from Durham uh
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy is recognized
 
04:49:08.448 --> 04:49:08.458 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the motion
 
04:49:10.490 --> 04:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I will also be
 
04:49:12.288 --> 04:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
brief because this bill would easily
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
work and is completely reasonable uh
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
this bill offers needed protections and
 
04:49:18.590 --> 04:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
increased notice for tenants and
 
04:49:21.050 --> 04:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
situations where landlord plans to
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
renovate property or remove property
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
from the market under this bill when an
 
04:49:28.970 --> 04:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
eviction notice regards an intent to
 
04:49:31.250 --> 04:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
renovate a renter must be provided 60
 
04:49:33.890 --> 04:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
days notice to vacate be told what work
 
04:49:35.930 --> 04:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
is being done on the unit they are
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
renting and an accurate time frame that
 
04:49:40.670 --> 04:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
the renovation will take
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
additionally it must be shown the work
 
04:49:45.288 --> 04:49:45.298 align:start position:0%
will take longer than 30 days and cannot
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
be done safely if the tenant remains
 
04:49:48.590 --> 04:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
living there
 
04:49:50.990 --> 04:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
if the eviction is based off the owner's
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
intention to remove the property from
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
the market this bill would require 60
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
days notice and that the unit is off the
 
04:50:00.050 --> 04:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
market for one year this is to ensure
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
that the reason offered for the eviction
 
04:50:04.910 --> 04:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
is in good faith and the tenants have
 
04:50:06.610 --> 04:50:06.620 align:start position:0%
adequate notice
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
and time to secure housing so in short
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
this bill provides a very fair balance
 
04:50:14.810 --> 04:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
where a landlord can still renovate
 
04:50:16.850 --> 04:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
their property or remove their property
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
from the market but also offer
 
04:50:20.570 --> 04:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
reasonable protection so tenants have
 
04:50:23.090 --> 04:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
stability and more opportunity to find
 
04:50:25.850 --> 04:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
alternative housing I urge my colleagues
 
04:50:27.890 --> 04:50:27.900 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:52:34.730 --> 04:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that house bill 401
 
04:52:37.250 --> 04:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
would place an unnecessary additional
 
04:52:40.128 --> 04:52:40.138 align:start position:0%
burden on our landlords and if I further
 
04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
know that in the current rental housing
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
market requiring a landlord to keep a
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
rental housing unit off the market for a
 
04:52:47.750 --> 04:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
year would only worsen the availability
 
04:52:51.288 --> 04:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
of units and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
04:52:52.850 --> 04:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
know that ultimately this bill would
 
04:52:54.890 --> 04:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
likely result in higher rental rates
 
04:52:59.330 --> 04:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:01.250 --> 04:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy is recognized for

04:53:07.730 --> 04:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
you miss speaker uh if I know that this
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
bill offers a fair balance between a
 
04:53:12.050 --> 04:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
landlord's right to renovate property
 
04:53:13.730 --> 04:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
and remove that property from the market
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
and a tenant having adequate notice to
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
avoid these very difficult situations if
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
I further know that this bill will
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
ensure evictions are done only in good
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
faith than what I now press the green
 
04:53:34.430 --> 04:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion about to

the member from Windham representative

kuchab is recognized to speak against
 
04:55:37.970 --> 04:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:40.970 --> 04:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker New
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in a housing shortage and
 
04:55:45.410 --> 04:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
we need to encourage new landlords to
 
04:55:48.410 --> 04:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
enter the market not force existing ones
 
04:55:50.930 --> 04:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
out with new regulations
 
04:55:53.690 --> 04:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
House Bill 469 would forcibly require
 
04:55:55.788 --> 04:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
landlords to participate in the section
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
8 housing Choice Voucher Program rather
 
04:56:01.368 --> 04:56:01.378 align:start position:0%
they want to or not
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
landlords would be compelled into
 
04:56:05.208 --> 04:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
entering into a 12-page government
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
contract without any say in the content
 
04:56:09.650 --> 04:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
of that contract
 
04:56:12.890 --> 04:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
they'd be involuntarily obligated to
 
04:56:15.610 --> 04:56:15.620 align:start position:0%
comply with 77 pages of program
 
04:56:19.070 --> 04:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
regulations which place many burdens and
 
04:56:22.368 --> 04:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
additional costs onto the landlord this
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
would undoubtedly exasperate rents
 
04:56:27.650 --> 04:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
a provision of this bill which allows a
 
04:56:29.868 --> 04:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
landlord to be excluded if their rent is
 
04:56:31.550 --> 04:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
higher than the rent Allowed by the
 
04:56:31.560 --> 04:56:32.690 align:start position:0%
higher than the rent Allowed by the
program

04:56:32.690 --> 04:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:56:34.970 --> 04:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
would undoubtedly encourage rent
 
04:56:34.980 --> 04:56:36.230 align:start position:0%
would undoubtedly encourage rent
increases

04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
increases
 
04:56:39.050 --> 04:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
we need to fix the Section 8 program and
 
04:56:41.208 --> 04:56:41.218 align:start position:0%
incentivize landlords to want to
 
04:56:43.730 --> 04:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
participate in the program not force it
 
04:56:46.190 --> 04:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
upon landlords
 
04:56:49.490 --> 04:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
please vote not no on not to pass so
 
04:56:51.170 --> 04:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
that a note another motion can be made
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:56:54.830 --> 04:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
the member from Durham representative
 
04:56:56.570 --> 04:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
Kenny is recognized speak in support of
 
04:56:59.868 --> 04:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:57:04.368 --> 04:57:04.378 align:start position:0%
so this bill regards individuals who
 
04:57:05.868 --> 04:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
participate in the housing Choice
 
04:57:08.390 --> 04:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program which are more commonly
 
04:57:10.490 --> 04:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
known as Section 8 vouchers under
 
04:57:13.128 --> 04:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
current law landlords can refuse to rent
 
04:57:14.990 --> 04:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
to a voucher holder for no other reason
 
04:57:16.850 --> 04:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
other than the fact that they hold the
 
04:57:18.590 --> 04:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
voucher without knowing anything else
 
04:57:21.530 --> 04:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
about the tenant currently here's the
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
reality for many Granite Staters who
 
04:57:25.730 --> 04:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
either currently hold a voucher or are
 
04:57:27.530 --> 04:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
waiting for one
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
first an individual may be on the wait
 
04:57:32.448 --> 04:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
list for up to nine years because there
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
are so few available then after
 
04:57:36.590 --> 04:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
receiving the voucher they only have 60
 
04:57:38.930 --> 04:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
to 90 days to secure housing or they
 
04:57:41.448 --> 04:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
lose the voucher but here is the issue
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
after waiting several years to receive
 
04:57:46.490 --> 04:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
the voucher uh
 
04:57:49.270 --> 04:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
they are put in the situation
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
where landlord just continuously say no
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
for that sole reason they lose their
 
04:57:57.890 --> 04:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
vulture they remain homeless in our
 
04:58:00.410 --> 04:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
housing crisis worsens
 
04:58:02.570 --> 04:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
so what does this bill do
 
04:58:04.368 --> 04:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
simply this bill would not allow
 
04:58:06.410 --> 04:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
landlords to discriminate against
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
prospective tenants for the sole purpose
 
04:58:11.150 --> 04:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
that they hold the voucher in other
 
04:58:13.250 --> 04:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
words it allows the tenant to just get
 
04:58:16.010 --> 04:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
their foot in the door that's it there's
 
04:58:17.930 --> 04:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
plenty precedent for such a bill
 
04:58:20.690 --> 04:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
including every other New England State
 
04:58:23.330 --> 04:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
this is because typically the holders of
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
these vouchers are either elderly or
 
04:58:28.430 --> 04:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
disabled and they're individuals who are
 
04:58:30.050 --> 04:58:30.060 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable and should be
 
04:58:32.930 --> 04:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
despite what you might have heard this
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
does not force a landlord to accept any
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
particular applicant over another just
 
04:58:42.650 --> 04:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
because they hold a voucher additionally
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions under this bill
 
04:58:47.390 --> 04:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
where landlords would not be impacted
 
04:58:49.250 --> 04:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
including when the Housing Authority
 
04:58:51.288 --> 04:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
determines that the dwelling fails to
 
04:58:53.810 --> 04:58:53.820 align:start position:0%
meet the housing quality standards under
 
04:58:56.510 --> 04:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
HUD meaning if the dwelling does not fit
 
04:58:58.850 --> 04:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
the standards required the landlord is
 
04:59:01.550 --> 04:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
exempt and they are not forced to comply
 
04:59:04.368 --> 04:59:04.378 align:start position:0%
with the regulations Additionally the
 
04:59:06.350 --> 04:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill excludes landlords whose rent is
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
higher than the program allows
 
04:59:13.128 --> 04:59:13.138 align:start position:0%
and to continue that sentence from the
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill and the rent charge for the
 
04:59:17.750 --> 04:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit is the same as the
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
landlord charges tenants for a
 
04:59:21.650 --> 04:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
comparable unit in the same building or
 
04:59:23.868 --> 04:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
Housing Development so there is no
 
04:59:26.288 --> 04:59:26.298 align:start position:0%
incentive to raise rent
 
04:59:28.910 --> 04:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
thus the bill and the exceptions create
 
04:59:31.250 --> 04:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
a very fair and reasonable balance
 
04:59:33.288 --> 04:59:33.298 align:start position:0%
between protecting vulnerable Granite
 
04:59:35.448 --> 04:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
status by giving them a chance instead
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
of their current impossible situations
 
04:59:41.448 --> 04:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
and landlords who still remain fully in
 
04:59:43.610 --> 04:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
control of who they rent their property
 
04:59:46.490 --> 04:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
to I urge my colleagues to support OTP
 
04:59:49.610 --> 04:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:59:52.910 --> 04:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
does the member yield for a question
 
04:59:59.330 --> 04:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
did you know that in fact people who
 
05:00:07.970 --> 05:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
have such vouchers to rent have a longer
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
longevity at his place than those
 
05:00:12.890 --> 05:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
without such vouchers and therefore
 
05:00:17.868 --> 05:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.590 --> 05:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:23.868 --> 05:00:23.878 align:start position:0%

05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 469 representative requests
 
05:00:29.448 --> 05:00:29.458 align:start position:0%

05:00:31.610 --> 05:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
seconded this will be a roll call vote
 
05:01:22.190 --> 05:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:24.288 --> 05:01:24.298 align:start position:0%
the questions on the motion about to

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:01:37.368 --> 05:01:37.378 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that house bill 469
 
05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
would require landlords to accept
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
Section 8 vouchers and if I know that by
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
doing so compliance with 77 pages of
 
05:01:48.590 --> 05:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
federal regulations and a 12-page
 
05:01:50.570 --> 05:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
housing assistance program contract
 
05:01:53.510 --> 05:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be required and finally Mr Speaker
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
if I know that the provision allowing a
 
05:01:58.850 --> 05:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
landlord to be excluded from the
 
05:02:02.030 --> 05:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
rental rate excuse me the requirement to
 
05:02:04.368 --> 05:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
accept Section 8 followers vouchers due
 
05:02:05.690 --> 05:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
to the rental rate of a particular
 
05:02:07.610 --> 05:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
rental unit is higher than the rent
 
05:02:09.948 --> 05:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
Allowed by the Section 8 program
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
could lead to rent increases in order to
 
05:02:14.270 --> 05:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
be excluded from the program where now
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:02:36.770 --> 05:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that HUD encourages
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
landlords to screen voucher holders the
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
same as they would screen any other
 
05:02:44.390 --> 05:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
applicant in that screening includes
 
05:02:47.208 --> 05:02:47.218 align:start position:0%

obligated to rent to any applicant that
 
05:03:03.770 --> 05:03:03.780 align:start position:0%

not obligated to accept a HUD voucher
 
05:03:15.770 --> 05:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
amount lower than the HUD allowed fair

05:06:19.490 --> 05:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:06:21.770 --> 05:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
this bill requires that landlords
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
provide at least 30 days written notice
 
05:06:26.330 --> 05:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
of any rental increase for
 
05:06:29.090 --> 05:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
non-restricted properties and 60 days
 
05:06:31.368 --> 05:06:31.378 align:start position:0%
for restricted properties
 
05:06:34.368 --> 05:06:34.378 align:start position:0%
in the case of an increase which exceeds
 
05:06:37.730 --> 05:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
15 percent a written notice of six
 
05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
months would be required
 
05:06:42.770 --> 05:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
the tenant could then terminate the
 
05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
lease with only 10 days notice to the
 
05:06:46.080 --> 05:06:47.448 align:start position:0%
lease with only 10 days notice to the
landlord

05:06:47.448 --> 05:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
further regulations of the time and
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
manner in which rent is raised will
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
burden the property rights of landlords
 
05:06:56.270 --> 05:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
cause landlords to raise the rents to
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
offset the additional burdens imposed by
 
05:07:01.250 --> 05:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
this bill and do nothing to solve the
 
05:07:03.530 --> 05:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
housing shortage in New Hampshire
 
05:07:05.868 --> 05:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
please vote no on OTP so that another
 
05:07:07.610 --> 05:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
motion can be made so that we can
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
prevent this step towards instituting
 
05:07:13.970 --> 05:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:15.530 --> 05:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
the member from Durham representative

horrigan's recognized to speak in
 
05:07:21.850 --> 05:07:21.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:27.948 --> 05:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
05:07:30.718 --> 05:07:31.430 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker
um

05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
so I Rise to speak against uh
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
HB 567 and this is against the bill is
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
as introduced one of the objections the
 
05:07:39.120 --> 05:07:39.910 align:start position:0%
as introduced one of the objections the
previous

05:07:39.910 --> 05:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
previous
 
05:07:42.050 --> 05:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
member had was to something that
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
actually would have been taken out by
 
05:07:45.530 --> 05:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
the amendment but that I support the
 
05:07:48.288 --> 05:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
bill either way so it's um
 
05:07:50.208 --> 05:07:50.218 align:start position:0%
not a rent control bill it's a red
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
transparency build
 
05:07:55.310 --> 05:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
and landlords can still raise tenants
 
05:07:57.230 --> 05:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
rent but they now can no longer do so
 
05:07:59.690 --> 05:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
without advance notice noticeably it's
 
05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
60 days advance notice some small
 
05:08:03.650 --> 05:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
landlords should only be required to
 
05:08:06.410 --> 05:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
give 30. and these deadlines which I
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
think are modest are probably only
 
05:08:09.550 --> 05:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
increases the less than 15 percent
 
05:08:12.590 --> 05:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
increases of 15 percent or more would
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
require six months notice and 15 is more
 
05:08:17.208 --> 05:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
than double the current rate of
 
05:08:19.610 --> 05:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
inflation which according to most recent
 
05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
numbers is 6.4 percent
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:29.330 --> 05:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
and uh so I know that uh something we
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
did here during the Heritage frankly is
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
this does prevent landlords from raising
 
05:08:35.030 --> 05:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
the rent to cover unanticipated expenses
 
05:08:36.110 --> 05:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
although the actual specific
 
05:08:37.970 --> 05:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
possibilities we were told about the
 
05:08:40.128 --> 05:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
hearing were actually things that can be
 
05:08:42.530 --> 05:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
easily anticipated and planned for
 
05:08:42.540 --> 05:08:43.128 align:start position:0%
easily anticipated and planned for
um

05:08:43.128 --> 05:08:43.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
just routine operating costs being
 
05:08:47.868 --> 05:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
higher than expected the occupancy rate
 
05:08:50.448 --> 05:08:50.458 align:start position:0%
for rental housing is almost 100 percent
 
05:08:52.430 --> 05:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
it literally rounds up to a hundred
 
05:08:55.628 --> 05:08:55.638 align:start position:0%
percent from whatever 99 Point whatever
 
05:08:58.610 --> 05:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
six percent I think it is
 
05:09:00.288 --> 05:09:00.298 align:start position:0%
they're twice with the average family
 
05:09:02.690 --> 05:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
could pay those prices are high for many
 
05:09:04.850 --> 05:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
reasons I don't think it's because the
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
law is too tough in the landlords and I
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
don't actually don't think it's also the
 
05:09:11.628 --> 05:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
rising cost of Maintenance so can you
 
05:09:13.788 --> 05:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
hold up for a sec if you guys want to
 
05:09:15.530 --> 05:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
have conversations there's a really nice
 
05:09:17.448 --> 05:09:17.458 align:start position:0%
room out there for the member has a
 
05:09:19.368 --> 05:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
right to be heard okay oh thank you Mr
 
05:09:19.378 --> 05:09:20.390 align:start position:0%
right to be heard okay oh thank you Mr
Speaker

05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
05:09:22.128 --> 05:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
so I think we have the right to expect
 
05:09:25.430 --> 05:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
landlords like any other business people
 
05:09:28.010 --> 05:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
to uh you know manage their businesses
 
05:09:30.530 --> 05:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
properly in a way that's fair uh for
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
their customers the tenants and also
 
05:09:34.610 --> 05:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
fair for themselves
 
05:09:37.970 --> 05:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
anyway you can we can if this bill does
 
05:09:37.980 --> 05:09:39.050 align:start position:0%
anyway you can we can if this bill does
pass

05:09:39.050 --> 05:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:09:40.490 --> 05:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
um the landlord can still raise the rent
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
by more than 50 percent they just have
 
05:09:45.050 --> 05:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
to wait more than six months for the
 
05:09:46.730 --> 05:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
increase to take effect
 
05:09:49.670 --> 05:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm giving the market the way it is
 
05:09:51.650 --> 05:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
they can probably get it so finally also
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
we heard about the free market during
 
05:09:55.490 --> 05:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
the pi for the previous Bill rental
 
05:09:58.010 --> 05:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
housing market no way resembles the free
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
market we all learned about it econ 101
 
05:10:01.850 --> 05:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
I assume probably most of us took some
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
version of econ 101
 
05:10:05.510 --> 05:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
but it still can't function properly
 
05:10:07.250 --> 05:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
unless both sides of the transaction
 
05:10:10.010 --> 05:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
that what the price will be
 
05:10:12.110 --> 05:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
so this bill simply provides price
 
05:10:14.750 --> 05:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
transparencies I think it's a
 
05:10:17.170 --> 05:10:17.180 align:start position:0%
so I urge you all to uh
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
Luke green and Pastor Bill as as
 
05:10:25.368 --> 05:10:25.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
a number another member from Durham
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny is recognized to
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the motion
 
05:10:33.288 --> 05:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker uh last time I'll
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
be up here today I promise uh so HB 567
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
is a simple build that requires uh
 
05:10:42.170 --> 05:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
tenants are given additional notice in
 
05:10:44.208 --> 05:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
certain situations when rent is being
 
05:10:46.010 --> 05:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
increased instead of the current law
 
05:10:48.288 --> 05:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
which only provides 30 days in every
 
05:10:51.170 --> 05:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
situation this bill increases the notice
 
05:10:54.110 --> 05:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh of an owner of a restricted
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
residential property that they must give
 
05:10:58.490 --> 05:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
60 days but owners of unrestricted
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
residential property would remain at the
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
current 30-day notice so in other words
 
05:11:06.350 --> 05:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would only impact owners who
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
are in the business of renting property
 
05:11:12.730 --> 05:11:12.740 align:start position:0%
but not truly smaller landlords also
 
05:11:15.288 --> 05:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
without the amendment this bill requires
 
05:11:17.810 --> 05:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
six months notice for rent increases
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
that exceed 15 percent of rent in effect
 
05:11:25.128 --> 05:11:25.138 align:start position:0%
at the time of this notice 15 which is
 
05:11:28.190 --> 05:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
an egregious increase uh it's this
 
05:11:30.530 --> 05:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
strikes a fair balance between ensuring
 
05:11:32.330 --> 05:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
landlords still have their right to
 
05:11:34.850 --> 05:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
raise rents while protecting tenants in
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable situations and from
 
05:11:40.250 --> 05:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
unambiguously egregious increases as we
 
05:11:42.230 --> 05:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
all know we are experiencing a housing
 
05:11:44.390 --> 05:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
crisis in New Hampshire this puts
 
05:11:46.430 --> 05:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
individuals in impossible situations
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
where without adequate notice of
 
05:11:51.470 --> 05:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
significant rent increases they may
 
05:11:54.110 --> 05:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
realistically not be able to pay not be
 
05:11:55.910 --> 05:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
able to find more income and most
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
certainly not find new housing as it
 
05:12:01.490 --> 05:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
would nearly be impossible in such short
 
05:12:03.890 --> 05:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
timelines that are under current law
 
05:12:06.170 --> 05:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
this is not rent control this is a
 
05:12:08.030 --> 05:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable measure that gives Granite
 
05:12:09.890 --> 05:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
Staters more time to plan in budget
 
05:12:12.110 --> 05:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
instead of being stuck in impossible
 
05:12:13.970 --> 05:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
situations so I urge my colleagues to
 
05:12:16.368 --> 05:12:16.378 align:start position:0%
support the OTP motion thank you Mr
 
05:12:18.530 --> 05:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
Speaker does a member yield for a
 
05:12:18.540 --> 05:12:19.788 align:start position:0%

05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:12:25.970 --> 05:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:27.770 --> 05:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion about to
 
05:12:30.288 --> 05:12:30.298 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 567 representative

it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
05:12:50.930 --> 05:12:50.940 align:start position:0%

05:13:51.288 --> 05:13:51.298 align:start position:0%

on House Bill 567 this is a roll call
 
05:13:54.180 --> 05:13:56.090 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 567 this is a roll call

representative Wallace is recognized for
 
05:13:59.570 --> 05:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
05:14:02.570 --> 05:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
05:14:05.330 --> 05:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
know that house bill 567 is an obvious
 
05:14:08.208 --> 05:14:08.218 align:start position:0%
step towards rent control and if I
 
05:14:09.948 --> 05:14:09.958 align:start position:0%
further know that the bill requires
 
05:14:12.288 --> 05:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
owners of restricted properties to
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
provide 60 days to six months notice of
 
05:14:17.208 --> 05:14:17.218 align:start position:0%
the owner's intent to raise the rent as
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
a function of the percentage of the rent
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
increase and if I know that after
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
issuance of the rent increase notice the
 
05:14:27.230 --> 05:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
tenant needs only provide 10 days notice
 
05:14:29.448 --> 05:14:29.458 align:start position:0%
of intent to vacate and end the lease if
 
05:14:32.030 --> 05:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
the tenant so chooses and finally Mr
 
05:14:33.650 --> 05:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that once again
 
05:14:35.868 --> 05:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill will likely lead to
 
05:14:38.270 --> 05:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
higher rents would I now press the red
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:43.970 --> 05:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo is recognized
 
05:14:52.128 --> 05:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:14:58.368 --> 05:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that tenants of
 
05:15:01.090 --> 05:15:01.100 align:start position:0%
owner occupied or small properties
 
05:15:04.610 --> 05:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
deserve at least a 30-day notice of rent
 
05:15:04.620 --> 05:15:06.170 align:start position:0%
deserve at least a 30-day notice of rent
increase

05:15:06.170 --> 05:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
increase
 
05:15:08.690 --> 05:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
and if I know that tenants of large
 
05:15:11.628 --> 05:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
properties deserve at least a 60-day
 
05:15:14.810 --> 05:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
notice of any rent increase that is more
 
05:15:18.590 --> 05:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
than 15 percent of the current rent
 
05:15:20.990 --> 05:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
if I know that these notices allow the
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
tenant time to find other housing if
 
05:15:26.930 --> 05:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
they feel they are unable or unwilling
 
05:15:29.628 --> 05:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
to pay the increased rent amount then I
 
05:15:32.090 --> 05:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
would push the green button in vote to
 
05:15:38.030 --> 05:15:38.040 align:start position:0%

Representatives

05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
05:23:42.590 --> 05:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
I forgot that this bill was mine and I
 
05:23:44.868 --> 05:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to speak but somebody else
 
05:23:47.448 --> 05:23:47.458 align:start position:0%
gave it to me anyway
 
05:23:49.910 --> 05:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
while the voters of a district elect the
 
05:23:53.448 --> 05:23:53.458 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen School Board Etc the
 
05:23:56.208 --> 05:23:56.218 align:start position:0%
interest of the voters are not identical
 
05:23:58.788 --> 05:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
to those of the board
 
05:24:02.150 --> 05:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
using tax money taken from someone to
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
lobby for something that the citizens
 
05:24:08.930 --> 05:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
may strongly disagree with is the sort
 
05:24:11.150 --> 05:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
of activity that the courts have found
 
05:24:14.990 --> 05:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
to be compelled speech it is wrong
 
05:24:17.690 --> 05:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
this bill just requires that the voters
 
05:24:20.690 --> 05:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
in the town School District Etc vote to
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
approve the spending of local tax money
 
05:24:26.708 --> 05:24:26.718 align:start position:0%
on lobbying
 
05:24:29.690 --> 05:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
restricting the use of State money for
 
05:24:34.730 --> 05:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
lobbying is under RSA 15 colon 5. State
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
money cannot be used for lobbying
 
05:24:37.798 --> 05:24:40.368 align:start position:0%
money cannot be used for lobbying
obviously

05:24:40.368 --> 05:24:40.378 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
05:24:43.128 --> 05:24:43.138 align:start position:0%
currently no recipient of a grant or
 
05:24:45.288 --> 05:24:45.298 align:start position:0%
appropriation of State funds may use
 
05:24:49.010 --> 05:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
those funds to Lobby the legislature
 
05:24:53.810 --> 05:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
it this bill allows local tax money to
 
05:24:56.330 --> 05:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
be spent on lobbying if approved by the
 
05:24:56.340 --> 05:24:57.890 align:start position:0%
be spent on lobbying if approved by the
voters

05:24:57.890 --> 05:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
voters
 
05:25:00.110 --> 05:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
this is the lease that should be done to
 
05:25:02.690 --> 05:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
protect the people from lobbying from
 
05:25:05.868 --> 05:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
for issues that maybe they may disagree
 
05:25:05.878 --> 05:25:08.570 align:start position:0%
for issues that maybe they may disagree
with

05:25:08.570 --> 05:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:12.288 --> 05:25:12.298 align:start position:0%
and then the nhma and New Hampshire
 
05:25:15.230 --> 05:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
School Board Association spend a lot of
 
05:25:19.128 --> 05:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
time here in the house lobbying lobbying
 
05:25:21.050 --> 05:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of times for
 
05:25:23.930 --> 05:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
stuff that is against
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
the voters
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
but for the people that paid us salaries
 
05:25:32.750 --> 05:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.650 --> 05:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
this this bill says neither Warren
 
05:25:39.230 --> 05:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
article so the people the voters know
 
05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
that they are spending local money for
 
05:25:42.480 --> 05:25:43.670 align:start position:0%
that they are spending local money for
lobbying

05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
so please join me in pushing the red
 
05:25:50.330 --> 05:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
button so a correct motion may be made
 
05:25:52.730 --> 05:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:25:58.330 --> 05:25:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:01.610 --> 05:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues
 
05:26:03.410 --> 05:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
as we just heard this bill will demand
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
RSA 15 colon 5 to require towns and
 
05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
school districts to use a warrant
 
05:26:12.170 --> 05:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
article for the approval of each and
 
05:26:15.288 --> 05:26:15.298 align:start position:0%
every lobbying agent that might assist
 
05:26:17.448 --> 05:26:17.458 align:start position:0%
the town in understanding the impacts of
 
05:26:17.458 --> 05:26:19.310 align:start position:0%
the town in understanding the impacts of
legislation

05:26:19.310 --> 05:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:26:21.770 --> 05:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
requiring the Warren article for each
 
05:26:24.650 --> 05:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
agency that lobbies for and or against
 
05:26:26.868 --> 05:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
legislation is absolutely impractical
 
05:26:29.810 --> 05:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
and would severely impede the ability of
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
local officials and legislators to
 
05:26:34.730 --> 05:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
effectively manage the Prudential
 
05:26:36.770 --> 05:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
Affairs of their communities and
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
therefore I urge you
 
05:26:41.868 --> 05:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
to support the strong bipartisan vote of
 
05:26:41.878 --> 05:26:43.010 align:start position:0%
to support the strong bipartisan vote of
itl

05:26:43.010 --> 05:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
itl
 
05:26:45.050 --> 05:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
by pressing the green button
 
05:26:46.850 --> 05:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
supporters of this bill argue it is
 
05:26:49.128 --> 05:26:49.138 align:start position:0%
needed to ensure transparency about the
 
05:26:51.530 --> 05:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
cost of lobbying efforts and to ensure
 
05:26:53.330 --> 05:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
that voters have a say into whether they
 
05:26:55.250 --> 05:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
want lobbying efforts at all
 
05:26:58.490 --> 05:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
but this transparency already exists
 
05:27:00.770 --> 05:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
organizations that Lobby already
 
05:27:03.288 --> 05:27:03.298 align:start position:0%
register and file quarterly Financial
 
05:27:05.570 --> 05:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
reports with the New Hampshire Secretary
 
05:27:07.730 --> 05:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
of State and these are readily available
 
05:27:10.070 --> 05:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
in multiple forms on the Secretary of
 
05:27:11.810 --> 05:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
State's website
 
05:27:16.730 --> 05:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
RSA 3217 also requires that a line item
 
05:27:19.610 --> 05:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
detailed budget be provided to the
 
05:27:21.770 --> 05:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
budget committee for consideration and
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
this would include any dues to any
 
05:27:27.050 --> 05:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
member organizations proposed in the
 
05:27:30.470 --> 05:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
operating budget Appropriations can also
 
05:27:32.208 --> 05:27:32.218 align:start position:0%
be contained in separate warrant
 
05:27:34.910 --> 05:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
articles either by the governing body or
 
05:27:38.628 --> 05:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
um all this information is readily
 
05:27:41.810 --> 05:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
available to the public and the voters
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
the legislative body can then amend or
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
zero outline items
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
for such items through the annual
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
meeting process or vote these warrant
 
05:27:53.208 --> 05:27:53.218 align:start position:0%
articles down outright therefore voters
 
05:27:55.850 --> 05:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
already have the information as well as
 
05:27:57.470 --> 05:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
the power to make decisions on
 
05:27:59.868 --> 05:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
memberships to these organizations that
 
05:28:01.550 --> 05:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
means this bill is not really about
 
05:28:04.448 --> 05:28:04.458 align:start position:0%
transparency it's about state government
 
05:28:06.890 --> 05:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
micromanaging the authority of local
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
voters and officials
 
05:28:12.288 --> 05:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
much of the discussion in committee was
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
focused on the training education
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
advocacy support and lobbying efforts
 
05:28:19.430 --> 05:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
provided by the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
Association an organization well known
 
05:28:23.570 --> 05:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
throughout Concord
 
05:28:25.390 --> 05:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
we all know that our towns operate
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
Upton's operations would not be as
 
05:28:30.230 --> 05:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
efficient or cost effective without
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
membership to the nhma
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
there is no other means to get the
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive service and support for
 
05:28:40.490 --> 05:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
local officials at nhma provides
 
05:28:43.010 --> 05:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
but we should not forget that there are
 
05:28:45.470 --> 05:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
many other membership groups like The
 
05:28:47.270 --> 05:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
Town clerks Association The Tax
 
05:28:49.368 --> 05:28:49.378 align:start position:0%
Collectors Association the New Hampshire
 
05:28:52.128 --> 05:28:52.138 align:start position:0%
planning this planners Association and
 
05:28:54.830 --> 05:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
many many many more which provide
 
05:28:57.110 --> 05:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
training education and advocacy that
 
05:28:59.628 --> 05:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
would be adversely affected by this
 
05:28:59.638 --> 05:29:00.948 align:start position:0%
would be adversely affected by this
legislation

05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
these groups are incredibly helpful for
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
small towns with limited funding that
 
05:29:07.070 --> 05:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
might not be aware of pending
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
legislation and that could have
 
05:29:10.970 --> 05:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
consequential effects
 
05:29:13.010 --> 05:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
and how beneficial I remember member
 
05:29:14.890 --> 05:29:14.900 align:start position:0%
organizations that assist legislators
 
05:29:17.930 --> 05:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
towns and City officials and Municipal
 
05:29:19.970 --> 05:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
Department employees here are some
 
05:29:22.330 --> 05:29:22.340 align:start position:0%
comments from the municipal and County
 
05:29:25.550 --> 05:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
Executive session on this issue what's
 
05:29:27.948 --> 05:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
wrong with lobbying
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a four-letter word if lobbying
 
05:29:32.570 --> 05:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
means getting information that I need
 
05:29:35.208 --> 05:29:35.218 align:start position:0%
then it's useful information as a public
 
05:29:38.810 --> 05:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
official I need that information
 
05:29:40.490 --> 05:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
our local school board chair was a
 
05:29:42.708 --> 05:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
member of the School Board Association I
 
05:29:44.690 --> 05:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
really don't know how you can delineate
 
05:29:48.170 --> 05:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
discussions of those members who sit on
 
05:29:49.990 --> 05:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
those boards from what is educational
 
05:29:53.270 --> 05:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
versus what is lobbying
 
05:29:55.368 --> 05:29:55.378 align:start position:0%
now I'm a select board member and
 
05:29:57.708 --> 05:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
there's hardly a meeting goes by when
 
05:29:59.330 --> 05:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't say that we should get
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
input from an HMA
 
05:30:03.050 --> 05:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that nhma is lobbying at
 
05:30:04.730 --> 05:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
all I can go tell them to jump off a
 
05:30:04.740 --> 05:30:06.410 align:start position:0%
all I can go tell them to jump off a
cliff

05:30:06.410 --> 05:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
cliff
 
05:30:09.530 --> 05:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
I have seen it how nhma has represented
 
05:30:11.590 --> 05:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
themselves as providers of information
 
05:30:15.410 --> 05:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
and it is not a lobbying for these
 
05:30:17.690 --> 05:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
reasons colleagues I urge you to support
 
05:30:19.570 --> 05:30:19.580 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming
 
05:30:23.208 --> 05:30:23.218 align:start position:0%
bipartisan itl vote of 15 to 5 by
 
05:30:28.368 --> 05:30:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:30.650 --> 05:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative Sana natasto has
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call vote it is
 
05:30:34.970 --> 05:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded members take their
 
05:31:41.270 --> 05:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:43.970 --> 05:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
05:31:45.590 --> 05:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee report of inexpected to
 
05:31:49.010 --> 05:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
legislate in house bill 51. also be in
 
05:31:49.020 --> 05:31:51.350 align:start position:0%
legislate in house bill 51. also be in
order

05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:54.170 --> 05:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote chair
 
05:31:56.330 --> 05:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Alicia Lucas
 
05:32:03.650 --> 05:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
if I know that many associations are
 
05:32:09.110 --> 05:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
able to separate their fees relating to
 
05:32:11.390 --> 05:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
information and training from those
 
05:32:14.030 --> 05:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
relating to lobbying and if I know that
 
05:32:16.128 --> 05:32:16.138 align:start position:0%
these lobbying organizations work for
 
05:32:18.590 --> 05:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
the best interest of their members but
 
05:32:20.810 --> 05:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that of the taxpayers
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that using tax
 
05:32:26.270 --> 05:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
money taken from someone to Lobby from
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
something that person may strongly
 
05:32:30.590 --> 05:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
disagree with is the sort of activity
 
05:32:32.690 --> 05:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
the courts have found to be compelled
 
05:32:35.570 --> 05:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
speech and is wrong would I then press
 
05:32:37.490 --> 05:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
the red button so another motion baby
 
05:32:39.948 --> 05:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
babe thank you
 
05:32:42.530 --> 05:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
chair recognized resident status for
 
05:32:46.490 --> 05:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:48.708 --> 05:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:32:51.948 --> 05:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the committee
 
05:32:55.730 --> 05:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
rejected this bill in a 15-5 bipartisan
 
05:32:55.740 --> 05:32:56.628 align:start position:0%
rejected this bill in a 15-5 bipartisan
vote

05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:32:58.970 --> 05:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
and if I believe that it's important for
 
05:33:01.730 --> 05:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
us as legislators to understand how
 
05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
local government works and to understand
 
05:33:07.250 --> 05:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
the concerns of local officials
 
05:33:09.770 --> 05:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
and if I know that organizations like
 
05:33:11.708 --> 05:33:11.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
05:33:15.110 --> 05:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
provide valuable information to us even
 
05:33:18.170 --> 05:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
if I don't always like that information
 
05:33:20.570 --> 05:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
and if I believe that local voters
 
05:33:23.150 --> 05:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to decide how they
 
05:33:25.850 --> 05:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
want to spend their tax dollars without
 
05:33:28.850 --> 05:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
interference from the state would I then
 
05:33:30.890 --> 05:33:30.900 align:start position:0%

05:35:30.948 --> 05:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker HP 90 would add two
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
new sections to an already extensive
 
05:35:36.650 --> 05:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
list of suggested items that might be
 
05:35:38.510 --> 05:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
considered by those charged with
 
05:35:41.390 --> 05:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
developing Master plans
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
so first of all let's look at what the
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
current RSA contains and that is a
 
05:35:47.330 --> 05:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
couple of paragraphs the first one that
 
05:35:50.090 --> 05:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
begins with the words shall include and
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
gives a brief accounting of a few items
 
05:35:56.090 --> 05:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
that must be part of the master plan the
 
05:35:57.770 --> 05:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
second paragraph begins with the words
 
05:36:00.708 --> 05:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
may include and then continues to list
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
as of now 18 items that are suggestions
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
for considerations the words may include
 
05:36:09.530 --> 05:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
are important in this instance because
 
05:36:11.448 --> 05:36:11.458 align:start position:0%
it indicates they are merely suggested
 
05:36:13.788 --> 05:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
rather than a list of restrictive
 
05:36:16.970 --> 05:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
limitations to be considered
 
05:36:19.128 --> 05:36:19.138 align:start position:0%
one of the two new items this
 
05:36:21.948 --> 05:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
legislation aims to include reads
 
05:36:24.770 --> 05:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
a transition to renewable energy section
 
05:36:27.410 --> 05:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
which includes an analysis of citizens
 
05:36:30.350 --> 05:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
needs for alternative sources of energy
 
05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
such as
 
05:36:34.490 --> 05:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
EV charging stations and hand Spike

many of us on the that are opposed to
 
05:36:49.850 --> 05:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
this uh this motion I believe that is
 
05:36:51.530 --> 05:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
simply not needed
 
05:36:54.650 --> 05:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
in fact instead of a never ending and
 
05:36:57.288 --> 05:36:57.298 align:start position:0%
growing list of suggestions as a lot of
 
05:36:59.810 --> 05:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
these bills tend to do or rsas tend to
 
05:37:02.690 --> 05:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
do this entire RSA section could be
 
05:37:04.610 --> 05:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
reduced to a single paragraph in the
 
05:37:04.620 --> 05:37:05.448 align:start position:0%
reduced to a single paragraph in the
future

05:37:05.448 --> 05:37:05.458 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:37:07.610 --> 05:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
one that gives those responsible for the
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
master plan the ability to consider any
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
relevant topic
 
05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
thereby eliminated all the other
 
05:37:17.150 --> 05:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions in the current RSA I ask you
 
05:37:19.250 --> 05:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
to oppose the OTP motion so another
 
05:37:22.128 --> 05:37:22.138 align:start position:0%
motion can be made thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
here I recognize representative

05:37:33.530 --> 05:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker a lot has changed since most
 
05:37:35.570 --> 05:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire towns and cities developed
 
05:37:38.570 --> 05:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
what are now their current Master plans
 
05:37:41.270 --> 05:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
many municipalities are probably gearing
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
up to beginning a new planning process
 
05:37:47.448 --> 05:37:47.458 align:start position:0%
Master plans don't dictate anything they
 
05:37:49.490 --> 05:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
don't have official standing as legal
 
05:37:51.948 --> 05:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
documents but they do provide an
 
05:37:54.948 --> 05:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
essential conceptual framework for towns
 
05:37:58.190 --> 05:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
to Envision their long-term needs
 
05:38:01.970 --> 05:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
HP 90 comes at an important moment a
 
05:38:03.708 --> 05:38:03.718 align:start position:0%
moment when those Master planning
 
05:38:06.830 --> 05:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
processes just getting underway must
 
05:38:09.288 --> 05:38:09.298 align:start position:0%
adapt to dramatic change while
 
05:38:11.570 --> 05:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
preserving the essential characteristics
 
05:38:14.990 --> 05:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
of the towns and cities they serve
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
adding the chapters that hb90 proposes
 
05:38:20.448 --> 05:38:20.458 align:start position:0%
will help towns address changes in
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
housing needs energy use and
 
05:38:25.610 --> 05:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
distribution new modes of transportation
 
05:38:27.890 --> 05:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
and a host of other factors that we
 
05:38:30.410 --> 05:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
can't even yet anticipate
 
05:38:32.208 --> 05:38:32.218 align:start position:0%
you've heard that this bill makes
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary additions that perhaps a
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
dozen years ago it was quite
 
05:38:37.200 --> 05:38:38.628 align:start position:0%
dozen years ago it was quite
comprehensive

05:38:38.628 --> 05:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
05:38:41.350 --> 05:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
but that was a dozen years ago
 
05:38:45.050 --> 05:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
hb90 gives towns guideposts in planning
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
for a future that looks very different
 
05:38:50.448 --> 05:38:50.458 align:start position:0%
than it is now and when they need to
 
05:38:53.448 --> 05:38:53.458 align:start position:0%
begin anticipating today
 
05:38:56.690 --> 05:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
colleagues at their best master plans
 
05:38:59.208 --> 05:38:59.218 align:start position:0%
provide a connection between buildings
 
05:39:02.750 --> 05:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
social settings the environment and the
 
05:39:05.208 --> 05:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
people who live in those settings
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
they are not and should not be immune to
 
05:39:10.490 --> 05:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
change and in fact one of their most
 
05:39:12.948 --> 05:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
important roles is to guide that change
 
05:39:15.470 --> 05:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
in ways that are consistent with how
 
05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
people want their towns to look and feel
 
05:39:21.470 --> 05:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
the language proposed in hb90 gives
 
05:39:23.990 --> 05:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
planners more flexibility than they've
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
had in the past flexibility to adapt to
 
05:39:29.030 --> 05:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
a changing environment
 
05:39:32.690 --> 05:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
but hb90 also retains the master plan's
 
05:39:34.610 --> 05:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
most important function
 
05:39:37.070 --> 05:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
to guide towns and cities in becoming
 
05:39:39.470 --> 05:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
places that people love
 
05:39:41.750 --> 05:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
places that can adapt to change while
 
05:39:45.170 --> 05:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
preserving the things we all cherish
 
05:39:47.330 --> 05:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
so while it's only got not only a
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
guidepost a blueprint if you will and it
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't dictate any particularly form of
 
05:39:54.910 --> 05:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
land use regulation
 
05:39:58.070 --> 05:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
hb90 proposes that planners do what
 
05:40:00.830 --> 05:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
planners do best plan for the future
 
05:40:03.770 --> 05:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
while preserving the history values and
 
05:40:06.530 --> 05:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
environments that make New Hampshire the
 
05:40:08.570 --> 05:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
place we love so much
 
05:40:10.670 --> 05:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
I hope you will support this bill not
 
05:40:13.070 --> 05:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
for what it will do right away or even
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but for how it will help our
 
05:40:18.530 --> 05:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
towns and cities adapt over time to
 
05:40:20.930 --> 05:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
changing conditions without sacrificing
 
05:40:22.970 --> 05:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
the qualities that make them so
 
05:40:27.310 --> 05:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:29.690 --> 05:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
has requested a roll call is that
 
05:40:36.650 --> 05:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:38.810 --> 05:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
05:40:47.090 --> 05:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:42.590 --> 05:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:42.600 --> 05:41:46.368 align:start position:0%
 
there

05:41:46.368 --> 05:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:48.830 --> 05:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
also be in order
 
05:41:52.610 --> 05:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know the
 
05:42:05.150 --> 05:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
current 16 suggestions contained in the
 
05:42:08.448 --> 05:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
land use master plan RSA are just that a
 
05:42:10.910 --> 05:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
laundry list of suggestions and if I
 
05:42:13.368 --> 05:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
also know that adding a new suggestion
 
05:42:15.770 --> 05:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
such as those proposed are totally
 
05:42:18.230 --> 05:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
unneeded and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
05:42:19.970 --> 05:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
know that those responsible for master
 
05:42:22.250 --> 05:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
plans can already consider everything in
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
the current rsas as well as the proposed
 
05:42:27.650 --> 05:42:27.660 align:start position:0%

releasing detailed housing assessments
 
05:42:57.288 --> 05:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
and if I know this will inspire many
 
05:42:59.510 --> 05:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
communities to reevaluate and examine
 
05:43:01.850 --> 05:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
their Master plans would I push the

honorable colleagues I rise today in

pass on House Bill 154.
 
05:48:43.368 --> 05:48:43.378 align:start position:0%
to be clear the bill applies to all our
 
05:48:46.430 --> 05:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
towns not our cities
 
05:48:48.530 --> 05:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
Town Public Health officers are
 
05:48:49.970 --> 05:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Department of Health
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%

recommends someone to DHHS who then

recommends someone to DHHS who then
decides

05:49:01.730 --> 05:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
decides
 
05:49:03.830 --> 05:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
if the person meets their standards and
 
05:49:06.470 --> 05:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
qualifications and if so the person is
 
05:49:09.288 --> 05:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
appointed to serve the town
 
05:49:11.810 --> 05:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
Public Health officers in towns do not
 
05:49:14.030 --> 05:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
act alone they cannot pronounce
 
05:49:17.208 --> 05:49:17.218 align:start position:0%
regulations or ordinances as edicts
 
05:49:20.270 --> 05:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
regarding public health concerns
 
05:49:24.350 --> 05:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
under the current RSA 147 colon one any
 
05:49:26.270 --> 05:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
regulation a Town's Health officer
 
05:49:28.970 --> 05:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
recommends must be approved and adopted
 
05:49:31.310 --> 05:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
by the town's select board
 
05:49:34.910 --> 05:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 128 colon 3 provides that the health
 
05:49:37.690 --> 05:49:37.700 align:start position:0%
officer and with the select board
 
05:49:40.670 --> 05:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
constitute the local Board of Health and
 
05:49:42.890 --> 05:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
they shall meet as frequently as needed
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
to review the state of local public
 
05:49:46.548 --> 05:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
05:49:49.010 --> 05:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
these meetings are where regulatory
 
05:49:51.288 --> 05:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
ideas are tossed around
 
05:49:53.330 --> 05:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
not adopted
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
these meetings are noticed and open to
 
05:49:57.048 --> 05:49:57.058 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:50:01.850 --> 05:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
RSA 41 colon 14-b titled the adoption of
 
05:50:05.048 --> 05:50:05.058 align:start position:0%
amendments of town codes and ordinances
 
05:50:08.150 --> 05:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
says that in towns with 10 000 or more
 
05:50:10.610 --> 05:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
inhabitants the select board shall have
 
05:50:12.470 --> 05:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
the authority to establish and amend
 
05:50:15.410 --> 05:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
Town ordinances after they hold two
 
05:50:17.570 --> 05:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
public meetings at least 10 days apart
 
05:50:20.410 --> 05:50:20.420 align:start position:0%
not more than 21 days apart
 
05:50:23.628 --> 05:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
provided however upon written Petition
 
05:50:26.510 --> 05:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
of 50 registered voters presented to the
 
05:50:28.850 --> 05:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
slip board prior to their vote the
 
05:50:30.650 --> 05:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
proposed Town ordinance shall be
 
05:50:33.530 --> 05:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
inserted on an article for town meeting
 
05:50:36.650 --> 05:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
so legislative bodies in large towns are
 
05:50:40.128 --> 05:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
already protected and having giving the
 
05:50:44.090 --> 05:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote as a body to
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
pass a new ordinance
 
05:50:48.610 --> 05:50:48.620 align:start position:0%
if this pill is intended to address
 
05:50:51.110 --> 05:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
concerns in smaller towns then it should
 
05:50:54.470 --> 05:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
say so and remember at this time the
 
05:50:57.048 --> 05:50:57.058 align:start position:0%
health health officer is Not Elected and
 
05:50:58.970 --> 05:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
cannot act alone
 
05:51:01.010 --> 05:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
another flaw with this bill is the use
 
05:51:03.288 --> 05:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
of the word special meaning
 
05:51:06.770 --> 05:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
under RSA 39 colon 4 special meetings
 
05:51:09.230 --> 05:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen when calling a special
 
05:51:12.170 --> 05:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
town meeting shall within one week after
 
05:51:14.570 --> 05:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
after posting the warrant
 
05:51:16.910 --> 05:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
cause a copy of the said warrant to be
 
05:51:19.070 --> 05:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
published in a newspaper of General
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
circulation in said town
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
within one week
 
05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
so if the charge if there is an emergent
 
05:51:28.490 --> 05:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
public health issue that causes the
 
05:51:30.830 --> 05:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
health officer to recommend a regulation
 
05:51:33.770 --> 05:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
and the select board agrees when would
 
05:51:35.330 --> 05:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
it be voted on
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
acting in good faith a slipboard make
 
05:51:40.368 --> 05:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
post a warrant for a special meeting
 
05:51:42.410 --> 05:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
within the with the exact language of
 
05:51:43.990 --> 05:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
the ordinance
 
05:51:46.670 --> 05:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
within hours of making the decision to
 
05:51:48.470 --> 05:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
have a special town meeting
 
05:51:51.110 --> 05:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
the date of that special meeting has to
 
05:51:52.970 --> 05:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
be after the warrant is advertised in
 
05:51:55.368 --> 05:51:55.378 align:start position:0%
the newspaper this may just be a couple
 
05:51:57.948 --> 05:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
days but it's certainly not the 24 hours
 
05:52:01.610 --> 05:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
is represented in the majority report
 
05:52:05.030 --> 05:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
plus sb2 towns have to have two meetings
 
05:52:08.750 --> 05:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
so that will be even longer
 
05:52:11.090 --> 05:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of this bill is to ensure
 
05:52:13.368 --> 05:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
the legislative body has a direct vote
 
05:52:16.730 --> 05:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
on proposed Public Health regulation the
 
05:52:19.850 --> 05:52:19.860 align:start position:0%
24-hour notice will depress the turnout
 
05:52:23.330 --> 05:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
of those voters that are being trying to
 
05:52:24.590 --> 05:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
be protected
 
05:52:26.390 --> 05:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then let's talk about the logistics
 
05:52:28.970 --> 05:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
and costs if a special town meeting is
 
05:52:31.970 --> 05:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
called for in sb2 towns taxpayers will
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
foot the bill for the unexpected costs
 
05:52:36.470 --> 05:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
of setting up the polling place paying
 
05:52:38.030 --> 05:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
poll workers supervisors of the
 
05:52:39.410 --> 05:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
checklist and printing ballots and
 
05:52:40.970 --> 05:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
having two meetings
 
05:52:42.770 --> 05:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
small towns with a traditional town
 
05:52:45.110 --> 05:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
meeting can move more swiftly but will
 
05:52:46.730 --> 05:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
still need to meet all the same legal
 
05:52:49.730 --> 05:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
requirements of an annual town meeting
 
05:52:51.948 --> 05:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
Town regulations are a collaborative
 
05:52:54.830 --> 05:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
Endeavor in this case the legislative
 
05:52:57.890 --> 05:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
body elects the governing body the
 
05:52:59.448 --> 05:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
governing body recommends a public
 
05:53:01.070 --> 05:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
health officer to the Department of
 
05:53:03.430 --> 05:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS appoints the officer the officer
 
05:53:09.410 --> 05:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
answers to the governing body who in
 
05:53:12.110 --> 05:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
turn answer to the legislative body
 
05:53:14.868 --> 05:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
the changes proposed by this bill are
 
05:53:17.090 --> 05:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to protect a Town's public
 
05:53:19.430 --> 05:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
health and for these reasons I ask you
 
05:53:21.230 --> 05:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
to vote no on the motion of ought to
 
05:53:23.390 --> 05:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
pass so that another motion may be made
 
05:53:25.970 --> 05:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:53:33.650 --> 05:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:35.330 --> 05:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker

conclusion

05:59:20.510 --> 05:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
this bill does not affect the powers and
 
05:59:26.090 --> 05:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
duties of a town Health officer and this
 
05:59:28.250 --> 05:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill does not affect the ability of
 
05:59:31.310 --> 05:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
state government state agencies and
 
05:59:34.548 --> 05:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
local emergency responders to deal with
 
05:59:35.590 --> 05:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
an emergency
 
05:59:38.990 --> 05:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill does not create any
 
05:59:41.690 --> 05:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
public health hazards this bill gives
 
05:59:44.270 --> 05:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative body in a town the
 
05:59:47.448 --> 05:59:47.458 align:start position:0%
authority to adopt any new health
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
ordinances which is the same Authority
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
given to voters in adopting other local
 
05:59:54.000 --> 05:59:55.490 align:start position:0%
given to voters in adopting other local
ordinances

05:59:55.490 --> 05:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
05:59:58.310 --> 05:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I urge my fellow

dilapidated buildings and the
 
06:10:18.368 --> 06:10:18.378 align:start position:0%
communities around them back to life
 
06:10:21.770 --> 06:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
79e has restored economic Vitality to
 
06:10:24.110 --> 06:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
many New Hampshire communities while
 
06:10:26.030 --> 06:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
protecting environments that are
 
06:10:28.128 --> 06:10:28.138 align:start position:0%
important to their histories and
 
06:10:28.138 --> 06:10:30.470 align:start position:0%
important to their histories and
traditions

06:10:30.470 --> 06:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
traditions
 
06:10:32.690 --> 06:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
but the law as it currently stands
 
06:10:37.430 --> 06:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:42.110 --> 06:10:42.120 align:start position:0%

well
 
06:10:48.530 --> 06:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
why might this be important it's
 
06:10:51.288 --> 06:10:51.298 align:start position:0%
important because it's not always just a
 
06:10:53.628 --> 06:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
structure that needs to be restored
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
most of the time those structures sit on
 
06:10:56.400 --> 06:10:57.970 align:start position:0%
most of the time those structures sit on
neglected

06:10:57.970 --> 06:10:57.980 align:start position:0%

06:11:01.010 --> 06:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
litter-covered lots lots that we all
 
06:11:04.250 --> 06:11:04.260 align:start position:0%

06:11:06.230 --> 06:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
knitting together our town and City
 
06:11:06.240 --> 06:11:07.670 align:start position:0%

06:11:10.430 --> 06:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
stabilizing these Lots will bring added
 
06:11:13.430 --> 06:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
benefit more opportunity for economic
 
06:11:16.430 --> 06:11:16.440 align:start position:0%

06:11:46.788 --> 06:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
79e is one of New Hampshire's great
 
06:11:49.310 --> 06:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
legislative success stories
 
06:11:52.310 --> 06:11:52.320 align:start position:0%

06:11:55.490 --> 06:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
life infusing new Vitality into towns
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
across our state
 
06:12:00.708 --> 06:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
adopting HB 177 will expand on that
 
06:12:03.650 --> 06:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
success provided badly needed relief to
 
06:12:05.810 --> 06:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
those who take on the risk of
 
06:12:08.510 --> 06:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating blighted properties
 
06:12:11.150 --> 06:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
I urge you to overturn the itl
 
06:12:13.548 --> 06:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this bill so that
 
06:12:15.650 --> 06:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
another motion may be made
 
06:12:18.048 --> 06:12:18.058 align:start position:0%
we should do all we can to support
 
06:12:20.510 --> 06:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives that preserve our Collective

06:12:24.350 --> 06:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:12:26.990 --> 06:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
we should reward those who invest in
 
06:12:29.510 --> 06:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
revitalizing those communities by
 
06:12:32.110 --> 06:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
allowing them access to the tax release
 
06:12:36.470 --> 06:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
hb's 177 offers and we should build on

turricot
 
06:12:55.548 --> 06:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker HBC 177 would make
 
06:12:57.850 --> 06:12:57.860 align:start position:0%
changes to what is called the community
 
06:13:00.288 --> 06:13:00.298 align:start position:0%
revitalization tax relief incentive
 
06:13:02.690 --> 06:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
program the first change would allow
 
06:13:05.208 --> 06:13:05.218 align:start position:0%
land now to be given the same tax relief
 
06:13:08.690 --> 06:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
that is allowed given or currently given
 
06:13:12.470 --> 06:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
to structures only the section change
 
06:13:14.090 --> 06:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
which is kind of important would allow
 
06:13:16.310 --> 06:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
for the extension of the geographic area
 
06:13:19.070 --> 06:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
from current downtown and City centers
 
06:13:22.788 --> 06:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
to any other area of the municipality
 
06:13:25.070 --> 06:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
legislation creates several problems the
 
06:13:26.270 --> 06:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
first one when you hear the words
 
06:13:28.610 --> 06:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
incentives and tax release should raise
 
06:13:31.010 --> 06:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
a few red flags and probably the hairs
 
06:13:32.990 --> 06:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
on the back of your neck the first
 
06:13:36.350 --> 06:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
decision to give is it allows the
 
06:13:39.170 --> 06:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
discretion of a few officials to Grant
 
06:13:42.170 --> 06:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
these incentives and tax relief secondly
 
06:13:44.208 --> 06:13:44.218 align:start position:0%
these same individuals determine who
 
06:13:46.190 --> 06:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
gets the tax relief and for how long
 
06:13:48.830 --> 06:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is subjective to terminate
 
06:13:51.470 --> 06:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
determination and it's ripe for special
 
06:13:54.470 --> 06:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
interest and favoritism next and the
 
06:13:57.230 --> 06:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
most important as with any of these type
 
06:14:00.230 --> 06:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
of programs the tax burden is shifted
 
06:14:05.270 --> 06:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
from most taxpayers who will see their
 
06:14:08.930 --> 06:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
taxes go up while tax relief is given to
 
06:14:10.548 --> 06:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
a select few
 
06:14:13.010 --> 06:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
lastly to enact the original tax relief
 
06:14:14.990 --> 06:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
program that's contained in the irsa it
 
06:14:17.090 --> 06:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
required the taxpayers approval through
 
06:14:20.030 --> 06:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
a warrant article or by a recorded vote
 
06:14:22.448 --> 06:14:22.458 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities legislative body
 
06:14:25.490 --> 06:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
adding this provision would bypass that
 
06:14:27.350 --> 06:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
approval process and automatically
 
06:14:29.868 --> 06:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
convey convey this subjective authority
 
06:14:32.390 --> 06:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
to the municipal officials
 
06:14:34.730 --> 06:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
the legislation is ill-advised for all
 
06:14:36.948 --> 06:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
the previous reasons and I ask that you
 
06:14:38.690 --> 06:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
concur with the majority report by
 
06:14:42.530 --> 06:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
voting this HB 177 inexpedient to
 
06:14:45.410 --> 06:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
legislate and I also request a raw call
 
06:14:47.530 --> 06:14:47.540 align:start position:0%

that's efficiently seconded
 
06:14:54.708 --> 06:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
06:15:19.128 --> 06:15:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:32.330 --> 06:16:32.340 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr uh speaker
 
06:17:14.330 --> 06:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
if I know infield development is in its
 
06:17:16.970 --> 06:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
simplest form is the development or
 
06:17:19.788 --> 06:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment of land that has been
 
06:17:23.948 --> 06:17:23.958 align:start position:0%
bypassed remained vacant or is an
 
06:17:26.448 --> 06:17:26.458 align:start position:0%
underutilized as the result of the
 
06:17:29.628 --> 06:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
continuing development process
 
06:17:32.810 --> 06:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
if I know that infill development may
 
06:17:36.250 --> 06:17:36.260 align:start position:0%
play a critical role in providing
 
06:17:40.190 --> 06:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
affordable housing which will reinforce
 
06:17:44.150 --> 06:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
the downtowns of cities and town centers
 
06:17:47.690 --> 06:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
and offer and an alternative to urban
 
06:17:54.470 --> 06:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
sprawl and if I know that HB 177 expands
 
06:17:57.548 --> 06:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
06:18:01.990 --> 06:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
79-e the community revitalization tax re
 
06:18:06.850 --> 06:18:06.860 align:start position:0%
relief incentive by replacing the term
 
06:18:09.948 --> 06:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
qualifying structure with qualifying
 
06:18:14.350 --> 06:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
property so that land in the zones
 
06:18:18.170 --> 06:18:18.180 align:start position:0%
adopted by the municipalities are
 
06:18:21.770 --> 06:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
eligible for tax exemption under the
 
06:18:25.250 --> 06:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
statute would also qualify
 
06:18:29.510 --> 06:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to
 
06:18:34.730 --> 06:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl of HB 177
 
06:18:37.930 --> 06:18:37.940 align:start position:0%
so that we can offer another alternative
 
06:18:48.288 --> 06:18:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:50.150 --> 06:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative Lynn

06:18:57.048 --> 06:18:57.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know this
 
06:18:58.910 --> 06:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
legislation would transfer the property
 
06:19:01.250 --> 06:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
tax burden to many for the benefit of a
 
06:19:03.470 --> 06:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
few and if I also know that unlike the
 
06:19:05.570 --> 06:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
original program in the irsa's this new
 
06:19:07.430 --> 06:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
carve out would bypass the Warren
 
06:19:10.250 --> 06:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
article or public body approval process
 
06:19:12.530 --> 06:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
06:19:14.868 --> 06:19:14.878 align:start position:0%

06:19:22.128 --> 06:19:22.138 align:start position:0%
historic districts is well beyond the
 
06:19:24.410 --> 06:19:24.420 align:start position:0%

06:22:25.250 --> 06:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
house bill 467. this is the bill

if you've all read it IT addresses
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
playground facilities
 
06:22:32.930 --> 06:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
and specifically for the language to be
 
06:22:35.448 --> 06:22:35.458 align:start position:0%
interpreted correctly
 
06:22:39.410 --> 06:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
it is for facilities to be built
 
06:22:45.830 --> 06:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:48.590 --> 06:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not an obligation prior it's for

Disabilities Act since 1990 has
 
06:23:38.270 --> 06:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
precipitated an opportunity for this to
 
06:23:40.970 --> 06:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
take place and for us to plan to provide
 
06:23:42.650 --> 06:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
this access
 
06:23:44.330 --> 06:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
and it's to promote Cooperative
 
06:23:46.310 --> 06:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
collaboration in a constructive
 
06:23:48.890 --> 06:23:48.900 align:start position:0%

06:23:57.670 --> 06:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
and with that being said this reasonable
 
06:24:00.410 --> 06:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
modifications and the the big issue that
 
06:24:03.948 --> 06:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
we have with playgrounds and also public
 
06:24:05.990 --> 06:24:06.000 align:start position:0%

Recreation
 
06:24:10.190 --> 06:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
is many times they're using soft
 
06:24:13.788 --> 06:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
materials you know for for walking and
 
06:24:16.070 --> 06:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
in this case the designs to allow for
 
06:24:16.080 --> 06:24:17.810 align:start position:0%
in this case the designs to allow for

uh crutches Walkers is a solid material
 
06:24:25.850 --> 06:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
and some of the commentary just in
 
06:24:28.730 --> 06:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
closing is that this is not restricted
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
to rubber mats it's also for strong
 
06:24:35.208 --> 06:24:35.218 align:start position:0%
materials with minimum maintenance and
 
06:24:38.930 --> 06:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
that can be cement tiles Etc as so

I'm asking for your support for house
 
06:25:05.930 --> 06:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
bill 467. thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
06:25:13.670 --> 06:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:16.310 --> 06:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
06:25:17.628 --> 06:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
opposition to the committee
 
06:25:19.730 --> 06:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
recommendation of ought to pass on House
 
06:25:23.750 --> 06:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 467. this bill requires that all
 
06:25:27.288 --> 06:25:27.298 align:start position:0%
public playgrounds constructed on or
 
06:25:31.190 --> 06:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
after January 1st 2024 have rubber
 
06:25:34.190 --> 06:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
Pathways to and from the playground as
 
06:25:36.170 --> 06:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
well as to each piece of playground
 
06:25:36.180 --> 06:25:37.610 align:start position:0%
well as to each piece of playground
equipment

06:25:37.610 --> 06:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
06:25:40.010 --> 06:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee concluded
 
06:25:41.930 --> 06:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
that this bill is inexpedient to
 
06:25:44.810 --> 06:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
legislate for a number of reasons first
 
06:25:47.930 --> 06:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
to be clear the issue at hand is not
 
06:25:51.410 --> 06:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
about denial of civil rights instead it
 
06:25:54.830 --> 06:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
is about putting into state law a
 
06:25:57.170 --> 06:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
specific material constraint for
 
06:25:59.750 --> 06:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
playground design which is currently
 
06:26:02.330 --> 06:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
addressed at the federal level
 
06:26:05.208 --> 06:26:05.218 align:start position:0%
presently under federal law any
 
06:26:07.548 --> 06:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
renovated or newly designed and
 
06:26:11.208 --> 06:26:11.218 align:start position:0%
constructed playground must comply with
 
06:26:14.650 --> 06:26:14.660 align:start position:0%
the 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act
 
06:26:18.430 --> 06:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
Ada standards for accessible design
 
06:26:21.470 --> 06:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
according to Ada in addition to
 
06:26:24.890 --> 06:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
providing a range of play experiences to
 
06:26:28.010 --> 06:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
individuals of varying abilities in
 
06:26:30.410 --> 06:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
accessible playground must have an
 
06:26:33.110 --> 06:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
accessible path from the edge of the
 
06:26:36.250 --> 06:26:36.260 align:start position:0%
play area to each piece of equipment
 
06:26:39.470 --> 06:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
constructed from surfacing that is
 
06:26:42.410 --> 06:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
compliant with the American Society for
 
06:26:46.430 --> 06:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
testing and materials standard ASTM
 
06:26:46.440 --> 06:26:48.948 align:start position:0%
testing and materials standard ASTM
1951.

06:26:48.948 --> 06:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
1951.
 
06:26:52.310 --> 06:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
this standard specifies appropriate
 
06:26:56.150 --> 06:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
materials for surfacing Pathways under
 
06:26:59.628 --> 06:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
and around playground equipment that
 
06:27:03.590 --> 06:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
meet Ada's accessibility requirements
 
06:27:07.610 --> 06:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
second by specifying a single type of
 
06:27:10.490 --> 06:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
surfacing material this bill has a
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
number of unintended consequences
 
06:27:15.410 --> 06:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
by prohibiting the use of other
 
06:27:17.570 --> 06:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate materials compliant with
 
06:27:21.948 --> 06:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
Ada's ASTM 1951 standards The Spill
 
06:27:24.670 --> 06:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary limits design flexibility
 
06:27:28.448 --> 06:27:28.458 align:start position:0%
based on existing site conditions
 
06:27:31.250 --> 06:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
increasing the top cost of the project
 
06:27:33.650 --> 06:27:33.660 align:start position:0%
at taxpayers expense
 
06:27:37.310 --> 06:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
as a result this bill May discourage the
 
06:27:39.590 --> 06:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
construction of new playgrounds in the
 
06:27:39.600 --> 06:27:40.430 align:start position:0%
construction of new playgrounds in the
state

06:27:40.430 --> 06:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:27:43.430 --> 06:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
this bill also forces towns to purchase
 
06:27:46.128 --> 06:27:46.138 align:start position:0%
imported Rubber products despite the
 
06:27:48.350 --> 06:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
fact that better domestic products may
 
06:27:49.430 --> 06:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
be available
 
06:27:52.010 --> 06:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
furthermore this bill does nothing to
 
06:27:55.910 --> 06:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
address existing playgrounds third and a
 
06:27:58.368 --> 06:27:58.378 align:start position:0%
further concern is the safety issue with
 
06:28:00.948 --> 06:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
regards to the use of Rubber products on
 
06:28:04.368 --> 06:28:04.378 align:start position:0%
playgrounds numerous ongoing safety
 
06:28:07.070 --> 06:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
studies may result in future Federal
 
06:28:10.548 --> 06:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
Regulations requiring the replacement of
 
06:28:13.190 --> 06:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
rubber surfacing on playgrounds
 
06:28:15.948 --> 06:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
this would result in further added
 
06:28:19.190 --> 06:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
expense to taxpayers in addition to the
 
06:28:22.368 --> 06:28:22.378 align:start position:0%
adverse health and safety concerns is a
 
06:28:24.708 --> 06:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
negative environmental impacts of using
 
06:28:27.890 --> 06:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
rubber surfacing on playgrounds which
 
06:28:30.230 --> 06:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
also needs to be considered
 
06:28:33.530 --> 06:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
in conclusion this bill is not needed
 
06:28:36.410 --> 06:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
since playground accessibility is
 
06:28:40.190 --> 06:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
already required under federal law this
 
06:28:42.230 --> 06:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill clearly presents a number of
 
06:28:45.470 --> 06:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
negative unintended consequences and
 
06:28:46.788 --> 06:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
most importantly
 
06:28:49.490 --> 06:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
this bill constitutes an unfunded State
 
06:28:52.850 --> 06:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
mandate on schools on towns and schools
 
06:28:54.708 --> 06:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
and violation of the New Hampshire
 
06:28:59.510 --> 06:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution part first article 28a for
 
06:29:01.730 --> 06:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
these reasons I urge my fellow
 
06:29:04.490 --> 06:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
colleagues to oppose the motion ought to
 
06:29:08.570 --> 06:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
pass by voting no on House Bill 467.
 
06:29:10.850 --> 06:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:29:18.230 --> 06:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:19.850 --> 06:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker
 
06:29:22.970 --> 06:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
I Rise to speak for the motion to ought
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
to pass HB 467.

enjoying their basic human rights and
 
06:29:41.270 --> 06:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
inclusion in society their abilities are
 
06:29:44.530 --> 06:29:44.540 align:start position:0%
overlooked their capacities are
 
06:29:47.448 --> 06:29:47.458 align:start position:0%
underestimated and their needs are given
 
06:29:51.708 --> 06:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
low priority yet the barriers they face
 
06:29:55.190 --> 06:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
are more frequent as the result of the
 
06:29:58.430 --> 06:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
environment in which they live as the
 
06:30:01.390 --> 06:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
result of their impairment
 
06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
these objects these barriers in public
 
06:30:10.208 --> 06:30:10.218 align:start position:0%
buildings transportation and Recreation
 
06:30:13.788 --> 06:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
facilities continue to be a problem
 
06:30:17.170 --> 06:30:17.180 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to amend
 
06:30:21.670 --> 06:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 155 by adding a new section
 
06:30:25.610 --> 06:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
requiring any public playground in the
 
06:30:32.570 --> 06:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
use on or after January 1st 2024 to have
 
06:30:36.770 --> 06:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
an accessible Pathways made of resilient
 
06:30:42.548 --> 06:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
rubber or compositive surfacing or
 
06:30:45.010 --> 06:30:45.020 align:start position:0%
similar solid
 
06:30:47.510 --> 06:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
surface material
 
06:30:50.930 --> 06:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
this bill would complement the federal
 
06:30:53.510 --> 06:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities Act
 
06:30:56.810 --> 06:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
standards the majority voted of the
 
06:30:59.830 --> 06:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
community believes that improving
 
06:31:02.690 --> 06:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
accessibility will make public
 
06:31:05.690 --> 06:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
playgrounds and parks in New Hampshire
 
06:31:10.070 --> 06:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
more inclusive and welcoming to all
 
06:31:14.330 --> 06:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
children and caregivers especially those
 
06:31:16.430 --> 06:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
06:31:19.548 --> 06:31:19.558 align:start position:0%
in addition adding Pathways made by
 
06:31:22.490 --> 06:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
these materials would relieve towns of

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
06:33:30.048 --> 06:33:30.058 align:start position:0%
know that this bill is unnecessary since

federal law already requires that any

standards for accessible design and if I
 
06:33:45.708 --> 06:33:45.718 align:start position:0%
know that this bill violates part first
 
06:33:47.750 --> 06:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
Article 28
 
06:33:50.690 --> 06:33:50.700 align:start position:0%

06:33:53.390 --> 06:33:53.400 align:start position:0%

06:39:10.970 --> 06:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you I uh in the infamous words I
 
06:39:13.850 --> 06:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
many of you may not know that cities and
 
06:39:17.868 --> 06:39:17.878 align:start position:0%
towns have the ability to pass what are
 
06:39:19.368 --> 06:39:19.378 align:start position:0%
called certificates of compliances
 
06:39:20.810 --> 06:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
certificate compliance for rental
 
06:39:24.590 --> 06:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
properties what this is is a function
 
06:39:26.690 --> 06:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
where the municipal the municipality can
 
06:39:29.030 --> 06:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
come in and inspect rental properties to
 
06:39:30.410 --> 06:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
make sure that people aren't like
 
06:39:32.750 --> 06:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
slumlords and stuff like that don't have
 
06:39:35.208 --> 06:39:35.218 align:start position:0%
a huge problem with that quietly kind of
 
06:39:36.548 --> 06:39:36.558 align:start position:0%
on board with that
 
06:39:40.310 --> 06:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
but what is kind of shocking is that the
 
06:39:42.770 --> 06:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
law can be read that they can actually
 
06:39:46.788 --> 06:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
inspect any property on the possibility
 
06:39:49.788 --> 06:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
that you could rent it and I know this
 
06:39:52.010 --> 06:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
because it happened to me
 
06:39:55.548 --> 06:39:55.558 align:start position:0%
so I I own a duplex in the city of
 
06:39:57.708 --> 06:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester I rent one side I live in the
 
06:40:00.650 --> 06:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
other I had to get my COC renewed we
 
06:40:03.470 --> 06:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
scheduled it they came out and inspected
 
06:40:06.288 --> 06:40:06.298 align:start position:0%
my tenants property no problems they can
 
06:40:07.548 --> 06:40:07.558 align:start position:0%
say all right now I have to do yours and
 
06:40:08.810 --> 06:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
I said well why do you have to do mine
 
06:40:10.548 --> 06:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not renting it I live in it they
 
06:40:12.650 --> 06:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
said oh well you could rent it and I
 
06:40:13.850 --> 06:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
said well you could say that about any
 
06:40:15.530 --> 06:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
piece of property and they said well I
 
06:40:17.750 --> 06:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
guess you could so I said that's a
 
06:40:17.760 --> 06:40:18.470 align:start position:0%
guess you could so I said that's a
problem

06:40:18.470 --> 06:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:40:20.390 --> 06:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
so I brought forward this piece of
 
06:40:22.430 --> 06:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
legislation it's limited to four units
 
06:40:24.948 --> 06:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
or less because four unit or less uh
 
06:40:27.048 --> 06:40:27.058 align:start position:0%
properties are treated more similar to
 
06:40:28.910 --> 06:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
single-family homes
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and they I don't believe anybody
 
06:40:33.590 --> 06:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
testified against maybe one person
 
06:40:35.750 --> 06:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty simple
 
06:40:37.788 --> 06:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
not opposed to the inspection of the
 
06:40:40.548 --> 06:40:40.558 align:start position:0%
rental property am opposed if it's owner
 
06:40:42.830 --> 06:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
occupied if the owner moves out and
 
06:40:44.628 --> 06:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
wants to rent it they have to get it
 
06:40:46.670 --> 06:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
inspected but if they're living in it it
 
06:40:48.830 --> 06:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
is your home the government has no right
 
06:40:50.390 --> 06:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
to come in there and just arbitrarily
 
06:40:52.430 --> 06:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
inspect it you can make arguments about
 
06:40:55.368 --> 06:40:55.378 align:start position:0%
inspection about sheds about anything if
 
06:40:57.048 --> 06:40:57.058 align:start position:0%
it's a safety argument somebody raised
 
06:40:59.570 --> 06:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
that in committee which was well what if
 
06:41:01.010 --> 06:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
something's rewired it's like well what
 
06:41:02.690 --> 06:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
if a single family home is rewired you
 
06:41:04.250 --> 06:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
need a permit that doesn't apply here
 
06:41:06.288 --> 06:41:06.298 align:start position:0%
any permitted work still has to be
 
06:41:08.570 --> 06:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
inspected so this is about routine
 
06:41:10.910 --> 06:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
inspections of owner-occupied units only
 
06:41:13.128 --> 06:41:13.138 align:start position:0%
so I would ask that you would please
 
06:41:16.430 --> 06:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:18.708 --> 06:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
there's a member yield the questions
 
06:41:21.048 --> 06:41:21.058 align:start position:0%
remember it does not yield
 
06:41:26.208 --> 06:41:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:26.218 --> 06:41:27.890 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:41:27.890 --> 06:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:41:29.708 --> 06:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:41:35.750 --> 06:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 155 a colon 7 Roman numeral 3 allows
 
06:41:38.628 --> 06:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities to inspect rental units
 
06:41:41.750 --> 06:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
or inspect units to ensure that they
 
06:41:44.930 --> 06:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
comply with local building codes the
 
06:41:46.730 --> 06:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
rationale for this is obvious it's
 
06:41:49.970 --> 06:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
Public Safety one of the major concerns
 
06:41:52.610 --> 06:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
that municipalities have is multi-family
 
06:41:56.270 --> 06:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
units and that's due to the density as
 
06:41:58.970 --> 06:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
well as the turnover that can occur and
 
06:42:00.830 --> 06:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
it has resolved many communities have
 
06:42:03.890 --> 06:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
instituted regular inspection programs
 
06:42:05.750 --> 06:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to carve out an
 
06:42:08.810 --> 06:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
exception in as was mentioned a four
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
unit of the last unit in which the owner
 
06:42:14.570 --> 06:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
occupied unit could not be inspected
 
06:42:16.610 --> 06:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
this of course presents a problem
 
06:42:18.230 --> 06:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
because it's a quarter of the building
 
06:42:20.628 --> 06:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
at the very least and it hinders the
 
06:42:22.430 --> 06:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
ability of the building code inspector
 
06:42:24.830 --> 06:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
to assess the overall safety of the
 
06:42:29.270 --> 06:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
building as a result uh it it puts the
 
06:42:31.548 --> 06:42:31.558 align:start position:0%
safety of both the tenant and the owner
 
06:42:34.310 --> 06:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
at risk this is why the majority of the
 
06:42:36.170 --> 06:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
committee recommended that this bill be
 
06:42:38.750 --> 06:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
voted in expedient to legislate and I
 
06:42:41.810 --> 06:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
would hope that the house follows the
 
06:42:43.430 --> 06:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the committee and
 
06:42:46.970 --> 06:42:46.980 align:start position:0%

cash real estate offers that were
 
06:45:01.190 --> 06:45:01.200 align:start position:0%

happen at any moment turning any
 
06:45:05.810 --> 06:45:05.820 align:start position:0%

06:52:55.190 --> 06:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
we we've heard this before in our
 
06:52:57.650 --> 06:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
committee a few years back it's it's the
 
06:53:01.430 --> 06:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
same thing but this amendment focuses on
 
06:53:04.430 --> 06:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
three things for us for a study
 
06:53:06.468 --> 06:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
commission one is the set of the effects
 
06:53:09.110 --> 06:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
of California
 
06:53:13.250 --> 06:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
emissions section 177 of the Clean Air
 
06:53:16.368 --> 06:53:16.378 align:start position:0%
react we know what that what that
 
06:53:18.530 --> 06:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
section does we don't have to study that
 
06:53:20.930 --> 06:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
we know for instance that it's going to
 
06:53:23.090 --> 06:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
ban the member will suspend it is
 
06:53:25.070 --> 06:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
getting an extremely loud in here the
 
06:53:27.048 --> 06:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
member has a right to be heard if you
 
06:53:29.150 --> 06:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
need to have a conversation take it out
 
06:53:30.708 --> 06:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
into the any room
 
06:53:32.690 --> 06:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
remember it may continue
 
06:53:35.208 --> 06:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker we we know what
 
06:53:38.270 --> 06:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
this uh section 177 does for instance it
 
06:53:41.570 --> 06:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
it bans combustion engines uh after the
 
06:53:45.650 --> 06:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
year 235 but uh that's one of the
 
06:53:47.690 --> 06:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
requirements of this amendment is is to
 
06:53:50.030 --> 06:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
study that so and I'll tell you why we
 
06:53:52.570 --> 06:53:52.580 align:start position:0%
don't need to study that because
 
06:53:56.390 --> 06:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
we already know what's going on we've
 
06:53:59.208 --> 06:53:59.218 align:start position:0%
had multiple studies going on on EVS
 
06:54:02.150 --> 06:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
charging stations infrastructure just to
 
06:54:04.610 --> 06:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
give you an example there's a bill right
 
06:54:08.330 --> 06:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
now hb11 that's the establishing a
 
06:54:10.490 --> 06:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
committee to study electrical your
 
06:54:14.048 --> 06:54:14.058 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging infrastructure SB 52
 
06:54:17.090 --> 06:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
just cleared committee this year to
 
06:54:17.100 --> 06:54:18.288 align:start position:0%
just cleared committee this year to
study

06:54:18.288 --> 06:54:18.298 align:start position:0%
study
 
06:54:21.770 --> 06:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
um uh to adopt the to create a study
 
06:54:23.570 --> 06:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
committee looking at EV charging
 
06:54:26.868 --> 06:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure deployment uh a few years
 
06:54:31.430 --> 06:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
ago we had sp57s 517 which is we're
 
06:54:34.270 --> 06:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
studying EV charging in infrastructure
 
06:54:36.948 --> 06:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
we have the New Hampshire Transportation
 
06:54:39.670 --> 06:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
Council was established in 2018
 
06:54:42.170 --> 06:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
encouraging new technology for for
 
06:54:44.390 --> 06:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
transportation and investment
 
06:54:49.610 --> 06:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
opportunities for things such as EVS we
 
06:54:51.230 --> 06:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
have the New Hampshire Department of
 
06:54:54.288 --> 06:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
Transportation that has the electric
 
06:54:56.448 --> 06:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
vehicle infrastructure investment plan
 
06:55:00.770 --> 06:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
for August 2022 covers EV charging and
 
06:55:04.368 --> 06:55:04.378 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we we have the NH
 
06:55:06.548 --> 06:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
06:55:09.288 --> 06:55:09.298 align:start position:0%
that oversees the Volkswagen mitigation
 
06:55:12.590 --> 06:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
trust again for EV charging stations and
 
06:55:15.110 --> 06:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructures and finally if you go to
 
06:55:18.350 --> 06:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
the federal website alternate fuels data
 
06:55:20.270 --> 06:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
center electricity laws and incentives
 
06:55:22.010 --> 06:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
06:55:24.830 --> 06:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
also has a wealth of information for
 
06:55:26.990 --> 06:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
charging station infrastructure and how
 
06:55:29.390 --> 06:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
it could be applied we don't need a
 
06:55:32.150 --> 06:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
commission another one to study this
 
06:55:34.968 --> 06:55:34.978 align:start position:0%
again and just as the antidote another
 
06:55:37.250 --> 06:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
requirement on this on this amendment
 
06:55:40.788 --> 06:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
would require us to study
 
06:55:44.030 --> 06:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:45.468 --> 06:55:45.478 align:start position:0%
what do you call it you got the
 
06:55:45.478 --> 06:55:46.368 align:start position:0%
what do you call it you got the
automobile

06:55:46.368 --> 06:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
automobile
 
06:55:46.378 --> 06:55:47.930 align:start position:0%
automobile
um

06:55:47.930 --> 06:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:50.930 --> 06:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
supply chain issue well I don't know
 
06:55:52.250 --> 06:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
what the state can do about the
 
06:55:55.850 --> 06:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
automobile supply chain issue uh I spoke
 
06:55:57.048 --> 06:55:57.058 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Automobile
 
06:55:59.030 --> 06:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
Association they said that's a national
 
06:56:00.350 --> 06:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
problem we all know it's a national
 
06:56:03.410 --> 06:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
problem to study that for the state to
 
06:56:04.850 --> 06:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
me would not be
 
06:56:08.150 --> 06:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
worth anything so I could go on but
 
06:56:10.730 --> 06:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
basically we don't need this amendment
 
06:56:13.310 --> 06:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's for one thing it's not
 
06:56:15.468 --> 06:56:15.478 align:start position:0%
ready it's it's redundant
 
06:56:17.510 --> 06:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of studies out there
 
06:56:20.810 --> 06:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
already to provide the same information
 
06:56:22.850 --> 06:56:22.860 align:start position:0%
please we don't need this amendment
 
06:56:25.368 --> 06:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
press the red button to put this
 
06:56:27.590 --> 06:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
amendment down thank you
 
06:56:28.788 --> 06:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
chair recognize your represent
 
06:56:28.798 --> 06:56:33.948 align:start position:0%
chair recognize your represent

06:56:35.810 --> 06:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
06:56:37.250 --> 06:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you all to take a look
 
06:56:39.650 --> 06:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
in your pockets in front of your seats
 
06:56:43.010 --> 06:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
for floor amendment to HP 92. this is a
 
06:56:44.570 --> 06:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
really short Amendment because it's a
 
06:56:46.968 --> 06:56:46.978 align:start position:0%
commission a study commission and this
 
06:56:49.430 --> 06:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
is a really important Amendment because
 
06:56:51.650 --> 06:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
it was requested by the automotive
 
06:56:54.110 --> 06:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
Dealers Association which is a
 
06:56:57.110 --> 06:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
non-partisan group that is looking to
 
06:56:59.330 --> 06:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
figure out how is New Hampshire going to
 
06:57:03.110 --> 06:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
address our transition to hydrogen and
 
06:57:06.048 --> 06:57:06.058 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles because it's coming
 
06:57:07.670 --> 06:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
um and so that's really the intent of
 
06:57:09.530 --> 06:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
this amendment is to create a commission
 
06:57:11.330 --> 06:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
and look at that and figure out what the
 
06:57:13.730 --> 06:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
best strategy is for our state and what
 
06:57:15.708 --> 06:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to do for us and for
 
06:57:17.868 --> 06:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
our businesses and so therefore I would
 
06:57:20.030 --> 06:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
ask you to vote green and yes support
 
06:57:22.010 --> 06:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
the amendment so that we can study this
 
06:57:25.010 --> 06:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
and come up with a plan thank you
 
06:57:27.708 --> 06:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker I request a division
 
06:57:29.810 --> 06:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
06:57:36.910 --> 06:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:51.948 --> 06:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:55.070 --> 06:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
who yelled for a roll call said Simon
 
06:57:56.390 --> 06:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
asked for a roll call is that
 
06:57:58.968 --> 06:57:58.978 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
06:58:01.128 --> 06:58:01.138 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
06:58:39.350 --> 06:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:39.360 --> 06:58:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:58:59.350 --> 06:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:04.010 --> 06:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
four seven H in your seat pockets
 
06:59:07.250 --> 06:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote the chair
 
06:59:07.260 --> 06:59:09.350 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote the chair
recognizes

06:59:09.350 --> 06:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
06:59:11.570 --> 06:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas for a
 
06:59:14.448 --> 06:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
06:59:17.390 --> 06:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
06:59:19.310 --> 06:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
know that the New Hampshire Automobile
 
06:59:21.708 --> 06:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
Association did not request this
 
06:59:23.750 --> 06:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment but merely said that they
 
06:59:25.968 --> 06:59:25.978 align:start position:0%
wouldn't oppose it and if I further know
 
06:59:28.250 --> 06:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
that there are multiple studies out
 
06:59:31.670 --> 06:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
there already studying EV infrastructure
 
06:59:33.590 --> 06:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
and charging stations and everything
 
06:59:36.468 --> 06:59:36.478 align:start position:0%
else and and this amendment kind of
 
06:59:37.910 --> 06:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
assumes what's going to happen in the
 
06:59:41.628 --> 06:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
future but we really don't know so with
 
06:59:44.150 --> 06:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
all these studies out there Mr Speaker
 
06:59:46.730 --> 06:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
if I believe all of this then would I
 
06:59:50.030 --> 06:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
not press the red button and put this
 
06:59:52.368 --> 06:59:52.378 align:start position:0%
amendment down thank you Mr Speaker gee
 
06:59:53.750 --> 06:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Munds for
 
06:59:57.530 --> 06:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:00.288 --> 07:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
07:00:02.330 --> 07:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engines
 
07:00:04.610 --> 07:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
account for approximately one half of
 
07:00:06.350 --> 07:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
the emissions of air pollutants that
 
07:00:08.690 --> 07:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
cause the formation of ground Zone ozone
 
07:00:11.150 --> 07:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
and one-third of the state's greenhouse
 
07:00:13.270 --> 07:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
gas emissions causing significant
 
07:00:16.070 --> 07:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
environmental and health related issues
 
07:00:18.288 --> 07:00:18.298 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the free market has
 
07:00:20.510 --> 07:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
already spoken and every major
 
07:00:22.968 --> 07:00:22.978 align:start position:0%
automobile manufacturer in the world has
 
07:00:25.310 --> 07:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
announced that it is transitioning from
 
07:00:27.650 --> 07:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
the production of internal combustion to
 
07:00:30.350 --> 07:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
zero or low or zero emission vehicles
 
07:00:33.048 --> 07:00:33.058 align:start position:0%
within the next seven to twenty years
 
07:00:35.270 --> 07:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
and if I know that New Hampshire is
 
07:00:37.910 --> 07:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
lagging behind other states in preparing
 
07:00:40.368 --> 07:00:40.378 align:start position:0%
for this transaction this transaction
 
07:00:42.770 --> 07:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
transition sorry
 
07:00:45.170 --> 07:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
and if I know that absent a plan to do
 
07:00:47.390 --> 07:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
so individual Granite Staters and
 
07:00:49.850 --> 07:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire will be
 
07:00:52.670 --> 07:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
significantly disadvantaged would I now
 
07:00:54.650 --> 07:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
press the green button to vote in favor
 
07:00:56.930 --> 07:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
of this amendment to create a commission
 
07:00:58.548 --> 07:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
to study the adoption of innovative
 
07:01:00.410 --> 07:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
vehicle emission standards and electric
 
07:01:03.230 --> 07:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles thank you the motion before us
 
07:01:07.788 --> 07:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
is on the amendment zero seven four

thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:03:34.010 --> 07:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
if I know that tabling would allow for a
 
07:03:36.048 --> 07:03:36.058 align:start position:0%
consideration of a topic like this in
 
07:03:38.930 --> 07:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
the future date and if I know that all
 
07:03:40.968 --> 07:03:40.978 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's neighbors already
 
07:03:42.948 --> 07:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
have these standards adopted and it
 
07:03:45.110 --> 07:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
probably would be good to at least
 
07:03:46.750 --> 07:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
07:03:49.610 --> 07:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
how the vast majority of the automobile
 
07:03:51.288 --> 07:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
markets surrounding the state of New
 
07:03:53.150 --> 07:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and which often comes over our
 
07:03:55.368 --> 07:03:55.378 align:start position:0%
border interacts with these standards
 
07:03:57.650 --> 07:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
and Ours
 
07:04:00.468 --> 07:04:00.478 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we could consider
 
07:04:02.448 --> 07:04:02.458 align:start position:0%
that in the future would I now support
 
07:04:07.010 --> 07:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
the tabling motion on hb92
 
07:04:08.990 --> 07:04:09.000 align:start position:0%

allow consideration of this topic at a
 
07:04:19.430 --> 07:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
future date would I now vote no so that
 
07:04:23.090 --> 07:04:23.100 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if you
 
07:05:42.170 --> 07:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
thought this amendment was bad
 
07:05:47.750 --> 07:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:50.090 --> 07:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes it puts New
 
07:05:52.430 --> 07:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on track to adopt the
 
07:05:55.968 --> 07:05:55.978 align:start position:0%
California emission standards for EVS
 
07:05:58.968 --> 07:05:58.978 align:start position:0%
section 177 of the clear Act of the
 
07:06:01.910 --> 07:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act it puts us in line with
 
07:06:05.510 --> 07:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
California New Jersey Massachusetts
 
07:06:06.948 --> 07:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
New York
 
07:06:10.010 --> 07:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
and and several other states of those
 
07:06:16.910 --> 07:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:20.270 --> 07:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
and this bill would forever tie us to
 
07:06:22.070 --> 07:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
any amendments that would come out of
 
07:06:24.770 --> 07:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
that bill forever because it's like
 
07:06:26.868 --> 07:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
taking a poison pill
 
07:06:29.330 --> 07:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think New Hampshire wants that
 
07:06:32.030 --> 07:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why people have been
 
07:06:33.650 --> 07:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
moving to New Hampshire from those
 
07:06:36.410 --> 07:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
States I don't think they want us to
 
07:06:38.390 --> 07:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
become like them
 
07:06:41.090 --> 07:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
it also creates this uh and if we adopt
 
07:06:42.770 --> 07:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
this it creates Hefty fines for
 
07:06:44.628 --> 07:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
manufacturers if they don't meet
 
07:06:47.208 --> 07:06:47.218 align:start position:0%
emission standards and it also creates a
 
07:06:49.730 --> 07:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
fine if the manufacturers do not meet
 
07:06:52.490 --> 07:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
their quotas for getting EVS in into the
 
07:06:55.548 --> 07:06:55.558 align:start position:0%
state I don't think we want that either
 
07:07:00.048 --> 07:07:00.058 align:start position:0%
it also prohibits like you heard before
 
07:07:03.250 --> 07:07:03.260 align:start position:0%
it prohibits any new sales of
 
07:07:06.170 --> 07:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
combustion-powered vehicles starting in
 
07:07:06.180 --> 07:07:08.510 align:start position:0%
combustion-powered vehicles starting in
2035.

07:07:08.510 --> 07:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
2035.
 
07:07:10.190 --> 07:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
well they're just
 
07:07:12.650 --> 07:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
fellow legislators this is a direct
 
07:07:15.230 --> 07:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
attack on the free market and freedom of
 
07:07:15.240 --> 07:07:16.490 align:start position:0%
attack on the free market and freedom of
choice

07:07:16.490 --> 07:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
choice
 
07:07:19.490 --> 07:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
because after all
 
07:07:22.490 --> 07:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
I have nothing against Eva cars if you
 
07:07:24.230 --> 07:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
want to buy one they're good
 
07:07:26.448 --> 07:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
they're they're good for what people
 
07:07:27.830 --> 07:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
want to buy them for as long as they
 
07:07:31.490 --> 07:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
know if you want one it should be your
 
07:07:33.110 --> 07:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
choice but the government should not be
 
07:07:35.750 --> 07:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
mandating what you buy
 
07:07:35.760 --> 07:07:37.250 align:start position:0%
mandating what you buy
so

07:07:37.250 --> 07:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:07:39.590 --> 07:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know that is the basic reason why
 
07:07:40.968 --> 07:07:40.978 align:start position:0%
this bill is bad
 
07:07:43.968 --> 07:07:43.978 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to have people have
 
07:07:47.750 --> 07:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
their choice pre-market is at risk here
 
07:07:49.968 --> 07:07:49.978 align:start position:0%
good government mandates are not the way
 
07:07:52.128 --> 07:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
07:07:55.850 --> 07:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
so please vote red
 
07:07:59.030 --> 07:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
on ought to pass on this Bill thank you
 
07:08:00.590 --> 07:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker chair recognizes
 
07:08:06.830 --> 07:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:06.840 --> 07:08:10.850 align:start position:0%
 
speaker

07:08:10.850 --> 07:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:12.590 --> 07:08:12.600 align:start position:0%

07:08:14.390 --> 07:08:14.400 align:start position:0%

07:08:14.400 --> 07:08:16.150 align:start position:0%
as originally
drafted

07:08:16.150 --> 07:08:16.160 align:start position:0%

Air Board standard carb
 
07:08:24.468 --> 07:08:24.478 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire is not California and
 
07:08:27.110 --> 07:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
so after much debate and discussion we
 
07:08:28.490 --> 07:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
determined that it made sense to have an
 
07:08:30.770 --> 07:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
amendment unfortunately this floor has
 
07:08:32.270 --> 07:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
already spoken an opinion on the
 
07:08:33.890 --> 07:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
amendment and so I would ask that you
 
07:08:36.350 --> 07:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
agree and vote itl on the underlying
 
07:08:39.650 --> 07:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:43.128 --> 07:08:43.138 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Mr Speaker
 
07:13:13.968 --> 07:13:13.978 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker simply put group host net
 
07:13:15.530 --> 07:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
metering is when a large customer
 
07:13:18.288 --> 07:13:18.298 align:start position:0%
generator produces electricity for the
 
07:13:20.510 --> 07:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
benefit of its group members and uses
 
07:13:23.690 --> 07:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
net metering as the accounting mechanism
 
07:13:26.030 --> 07:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
this bill expands net metering by
 
07:13:27.830 --> 07:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
allowing a customer to net meter their
 
07:13:30.590 --> 07:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
own excess production and then to also
 
07:13:33.468 --> 07:13:33.478 align:start position:0%
participate in group host net metering
 
07:13:35.270 --> 07:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
so what is wrong with expanding net
 
07:13:35.280 --> 07:13:36.468 align:start position:0%
so what is wrong with expanding net
metering

07:13:36.468 --> 07:13:36.478 align:start position:0%
metering
 
07:13:38.448 --> 07:13:38.458 align:start position:0%
a report commissioned by the Public
 
07:13:40.670 --> 07:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and published last
 
07:13:43.190 --> 07:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
October found that net metering does
 
07:13:45.708 --> 07:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
cause cost shifting whereby regular
 
07:13:48.468 --> 07:13:48.478 align:start position:0%
electric customers end up subsidizing
 
07:13:50.990 --> 07:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
the practice of net metering by a small
 
07:13:53.090 --> 07:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
number of other customers
 
07:13:55.610 --> 07:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
for that reason this legislature has
 
07:13:57.230 --> 07:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
been very careful and deliberate in
 
07:13:59.810 --> 07:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
expanding net metering over the years
 
07:14:01.910 --> 07:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore two bills we passed last
 
07:14:07.010 --> 07:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
year HP 1599 and SB 261 require the
 
07:14:08.750 --> 07:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to take up
 
07:14:11.510 --> 07:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
the issue of cost Shifting the puc has
 
07:14:16.250 --> 07:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:17.930 --> 07:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
if we know that cost shifting is
 
07:14:20.570 --> 07:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
occurring if the puc published a study
 
07:14:22.190 --> 07:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
showing that cost shifting is occurring
 
07:14:24.410 --> 07:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
and if last year we passed two bills
 
07:14:26.930 --> 07:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
directing the puc to address this issue
 
07:14:29.628 --> 07:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
then it makes sense to allow the puc to
 
07:14:31.490 --> 07:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
do what we've asked them to do before
 
07:14:34.250 --> 07:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
making further changes to net metering I
 
07:14:36.830 --> 07:14:36.840 align:start position:0%

I promise you I'm not going to use any
 
07:15:21.650 --> 07:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
acronyms and I'm not going to subject
 
07:15:24.468 --> 07:15:24.478 align:start position:0%
you to an explanation of the mechanics
 
07:15:26.330 --> 07:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
of net metering
 
07:15:28.368 --> 07:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
rather I'm going to describe for you a
 
07:15:30.288 --> 07:15:30.298 align:start position:0%
scenario that I hope will persuade you
 
07:15:33.110 --> 07:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
that you should vote
 
07:15:34.310 --> 07:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
07:15:37.910 --> 07:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill and remove the outdated
 
07:15:37.920 --> 07:15:39.288 align:start position:0%
on this bill and remove the outdated
restriction

07:15:39.288 --> 07:15:39.298 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
07:15:41.690 --> 07:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
on group net metering that this bill
 
07:15:41.700 --> 07:15:43.250 align:start position:0%
on group net metering that this bill
addresses

07:15:43.250 --> 07:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
07:15:46.610 --> 07:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
so imagine that five years ago say in
 
07:15:48.610 --> 07:15:48.620 align:start position:0%
your town
 
07:15:51.468 --> 07:15:51.478 align:start position:0%
your town decided to try solar energy
 
07:15:54.350 --> 07:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
and you installed solar on one building
 
07:15:57.770 --> 07:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
in town say your town hall
 
07:16:00.770 --> 07:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh like most solar arrays on buildings
 
07:16:02.810 --> 07:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
07:16:05.270 --> 07:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
array probably provides only a fraction
 
07:16:07.430 --> 07:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the energy that that building
 
07:16:12.410 --> 07:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:12.420 --> 07:16:14.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:16:14.090 --> 07:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:16.190 --> 07:16:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's probably only a quarter or
 
07:16:18.650 --> 07:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
even a third maybe if you're lucky of
 
07:16:21.288 --> 07:16:21.298 align:start position:0%
the total low to that building but the
 
07:16:24.650 --> 07:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
solar worked well enough that uh and it
 
07:16:26.650 --> 07:16:26.660 align:start position:0%
showed Financial savings and it
 
07:16:29.030 --> 07:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
persuaded a majority of the town that
 
07:16:31.968 --> 07:16:31.978 align:start position:0%
they should embrace solar fully and do
 
07:16:31.978 --> 07:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
they should embrace solar fully and do
more

07:16:33.110 --> 07:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
07:16:33.120 --> 07:16:34.510 align:start position:0%
more
but

07:16:34.510 --> 07:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:16:36.490 --> 07:16:36.500 align:start position:0%
very likely
 
07:16:38.990 --> 07:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
many of the other buildings that you
 
07:16:40.730 --> 07:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
have in town might not even be suitable
 
07:16:43.730 --> 07:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
for solar at all and even the ones that
 
07:16:45.890 --> 07:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
are probably similar situation if you
 
07:16:49.010 --> 07:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
put solar on them they would the array
 
07:16:52.010 --> 07:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
would not cover come close to covering
 
07:16:52.020 --> 07:16:53.390 align:start position:0%
would not cover come close to covering
the

07:16:53.390 --> 07:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:16:56.150 --> 07:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
total energy load of that building
 
07:16:58.730 --> 07:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
so the solution to that problem is to
 
07:17:01.730 --> 07:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
build one large solar array somewhere in
 
07:17:04.250 --> 07:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
town say on 10 acres behind your Public
 
07:17:06.350 --> 07:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
Works building
 
07:17:09.048 --> 07:17:09.058 align:start position:0%
and distribute the bill credits that are
 
07:17:12.110 --> 07:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
produced by that single array to cover
 
07:17:14.590 --> 07:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
the load of all the buildings in town
 
07:17:18.410 --> 07:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
thereby saving your taxpayers money on
 
07:17:23.150 --> 07:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:26.390 --> 07:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
under current law the town hall the one
 
07:17:26.400 --> 07:17:27.170 align:start position:0%
under current law the town hall the one
that

07:17:27.170 --> 07:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:17:29.810 --> 07:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
already has solar on it
 
07:17:32.390 --> 07:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
would have to be excluded from that
 
07:17:34.310 --> 07:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
group net metering Arrangement because
 
07:17:37.910 --> 07:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
it already has a little bit of solar on
 
07:17:37.920 --> 07:17:39.230 align:start position:0%
it already has a little bit of solar on
it

07:17:39.230 --> 07:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:17:39.240 --> 07:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
it
so

07:17:41.510 --> 07:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:17:43.788 --> 07:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
that would deprive
 
07:17:46.730 --> 07:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
the town of some savings that could be
 
07:17:50.930 --> 07:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
covered if that original building or
 
07:17:52.430 --> 07:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you had two buildings that were
 
07:17:55.070 --> 07:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
done originally already have solar now
 
07:17:57.048 --> 07:17:57.058 align:start position:0%
you build a big solar array to cover the
 
07:17:59.390 --> 07:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
whole load of the town but because of
 
07:18:01.910 --> 07:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
this outdated restriction you have to
 
07:18:04.368 --> 07:18:04.378 align:start position:0%
exclude those buildings that have
 
07:18:06.590 --> 07:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
existing solar from the group net
 
07:18:08.868 --> 07:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
metering Arrangement the reason that
 
07:18:11.570 --> 07:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
exclusion was put in place was because
 
07:18:11.580 --> 07:18:13.070 align:start position:0%
exclusion was put in place was because
originally

07:18:13.070 --> 07:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
originally
 
07:18:15.948 --> 07:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
10 years ago or more the utilities
 
07:18:17.690 --> 07:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
accounting and billing systems didn't
 
07:18:20.150 --> 07:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
have the capability to track the the
 
07:18:22.850 --> 07:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
credits from
 
07:18:25.490 --> 07:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
a building that had solar plus allow it
 
07:18:27.948 --> 07:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
to participate in group net metering but
 
07:18:30.410 --> 07:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
that is no longer the case so this
 
07:18:33.650 --> 07:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
exclusion is simply unnecessary
 
07:18:37.190 --> 07:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it deprives a town of all the
 
07:18:38.990 --> 07:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
potential savings that it could achieve
 
07:18:40.968 --> 07:18:40.978 align:start position:0%
from a group net metering Arrangement so
 
07:18:44.270 --> 07:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
therefore I urge you to vote ought to
 
07:18:44.280 --> 07:18:45.170 align:start position:0%
therefore I urge you to vote ought to
pass

07:18:45.170 --> 07:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
pass
 
07:18:49.128 --> 07:18:49.138 align:start position:0%
on HB 161 thank you
 
07:18:51.288 --> 07:18:51.298 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is auto pass and
 
07:18:53.570 --> 07:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
house bill 161.
 
07:18:56.570 --> 07:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
07:18:58.788 --> 07:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
07:19:00.530 --> 07:19:00.540 align:start position:0%

07:20:11.390 --> 07:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
the ocean before us is ought to pass on
 
07:20:13.910 --> 07:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 161 this is a division vote
 
07:20:15.890 --> 07:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative votes
 
07:20:19.910 --> 07:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:22.128 --> 07:20:22.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
07:20:25.128 --> 07:20:25.138 align:start position:0%
know that the state's largest utility
 
07:20:28.490 --> 07:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
paid 20 million 428 thousand dollars for
 
07:20:31.490 --> 07:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
net metering costs in 2022.
 
07:20:33.410 --> 07:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
and that expanding net metering will
 
07:20:35.868 --> 07:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
increase those costs
 
07:20:37.850 --> 07:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that nothing stands
 
07:20:39.890 --> 07:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
in the way of anyone buying and
 
07:20:41.868 --> 07:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
installing as much solar power as they
 
07:20:41.878 --> 07:20:43.670 align:start position:0%
installing as much solar power as they
choose

07:20:43.670 --> 07:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
choose
 
07:20:45.288 --> 07:20:45.298 align:start position:0%
finally if I know the department of
 
07:20:47.090 --> 07:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
energy opposes this bill because there
 
07:20:49.128 --> 07:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
is an open docket at the puc on net
 
07:20:51.468 --> 07:20:51.478 align:start position:0%
metering costs
 
07:20:53.868 --> 07:20:53.878 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to wait
 
07:20:55.850 --> 07:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
for a new price tag on net metering
 
07:20:58.070 --> 07:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
before we swipe our card to buy some
 
07:21:00.650 --> 07:21:00.660 align:start position:0%

07:21:05.690 --> 07:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:07.670 --> 07:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
if I know that there is no compelling
 
07:21:10.070 --> 07:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
technology logical or financial reason
 
07:21:11.990 --> 07:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
to prevent individuals with renewable
 
07:21:14.150 --> 07:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
generation in their home from purchasing
 
07:21:16.010 --> 07:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
supplemental energy as needed from
 
07:21:17.868 --> 07:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
whatever provider they choose
 
07:21:19.730 --> 07:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill provides a
 
07:21:21.288 --> 07:21:21.298 align:start position:0%
simple fix for an inadvertent
 
07:21:23.628 --> 07:21:23.638 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and inappropriate limitation
 
07:21:25.910 --> 07:21:25.920 align:start position:0%

choice
 
07:21:28.788 --> 07:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that with natural
 
07:21:31.548 --> 07:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
gas at prices as high as they are we
 
07:21:32.868 --> 07:21:32.878 align:start position:0%
should be doing everything that we can
 
07:21:35.810 --> 07:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
to support our customers or constituents
 
07:21:37.548 --> 07:21:37.558 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:28:29.150 --> 07:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
once again
 
07:28:32.628 --> 07:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
not going to lecture you with a
 
07:28:35.570 --> 07:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
technical explanation of anything
 
07:28:37.850 --> 07:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
just going to remind you that on this
 
07:28:37.860 --> 07:28:38.930 align:start position:0%
just going to remind you that on this
bill

07:28:38.930 --> 07:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:28:41.208 --> 07:28:41.218 align:start position:0%
as we all know the
 
07:28:43.670 --> 07:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
utility system is the farthest thing
 
07:28:46.730 --> 07:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
from a free market that could possibly
 
07:28:46.740 --> 07:28:48.110 align:start position:0%
from a free market that could possibly
be

07:28:48.110 --> 07:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:28:51.770 --> 07:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly complicated
 
07:28:55.570 --> 07:28:55.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:59.030 --> 07:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
this uh bill is about
 
07:28:59.040 --> 07:29:01.250 align:start position:0%
this uh bill is about
the

07:29:01.250 --> 07:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:29:03.530 --> 07:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard which
 
07:29:06.890 --> 07:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot about and
 
07:29:10.548 --> 07:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
the reason that you should vote
 
07:29:10.558 --> 07:29:11.868 align:start position:0%
the reason that you should vote
against

07:29:11.868 --> 07:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
against
 
07:29:13.430 --> 07:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
07:29:15.410 --> 07:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
07:29:19.548 --> 07:29:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:22.788 --> 07:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
it purports to inform consumers but it
 
07:29:25.610 --> 07:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
would inform them in a very one-sided
 
07:29:25.620 --> 07:29:26.690 align:start position:0%
would inform them in a very one-sided
way

07:29:26.690 --> 07:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
way
 
07:29:30.530 --> 07:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
it would inform them of the total amount
 
07:29:34.128 --> 07:29:34.138 align:start position:0%
of the very small charge that all of us
 
07:29:36.948 --> 07:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
pay on our electric bill
 
07:29:39.170 --> 07:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
each month to support the renewable
 
07:29:41.150 --> 07:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
07:29:43.070 --> 07:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
that our state has
 
07:29:45.230 --> 07:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
and that every other New England state
 
07:29:45.240 --> 07:29:46.368 align:start position:0%
and that every other New England state
has

07:29:46.368 --> 07:29:46.378 align:start position:0%
has
 
07:29:51.708 --> 07:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
and that collectively result in
 
07:29:55.670 --> 07:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
a significant depression of Demand on
 
07:29:57.350 --> 07:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
the Electric System
 
07:30:00.468 --> 07:30:00.478 align:start position:0%
which translates to significant cost
 
07:30:03.770 --> 07:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
Savings in the Wholesale Electric market
 
07:30:07.070 --> 07:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
which benefits all consumers
 
07:30:10.548 --> 07:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
but that's a a difficult calculation and
 
07:30:13.610 --> 07:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
a difficult explanation
 
07:30:17.150 --> 07:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
to disclose to Consumers
 
07:30:19.490 --> 07:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
07:30:19.500 --> 07:30:21.230 align:start position:0%
so this bill
would

07:30:21.230 --> 07:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
07:30:24.110 --> 07:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
put a number on the electric bill at the
 
07:30:26.090 --> 07:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
end of the year and and supposedly
 
07:30:29.330 --> 07:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
inform consumers of the cost that they
 
07:30:31.788 --> 07:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
are paying for the renewable portfolio
 
07:30:34.270 --> 07:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
standard without
 
07:30:37.910 --> 07:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
informing them at the same time
 
07:30:40.430 --> 07:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of the renewable
 
07:30:43.730 --> 07:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:47.330 --> 07:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:50.030 --> 07:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
you should vote
 
07:30:54.830 --> 07:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:56.448 --> 07:30:56.458 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative Doug
 
07:30:56.458 --> 07:30:59.868 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative Doug
Thomas

07:30:59.868 --> 07:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:02.030 --> 07:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker there's
 
07:31:03.530 --> 07:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
nothing complicated about wanting
 
07:31:05.930 --> 07:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
someone to know what your charges are on
 
07:31:08.448 --> 07:31:08.458 align:start position:0%
your electric bill and this and and that
 
07:31:10.310 --> 07:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
was determined several years ago by the
 
07:31:12.948 --> 07:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
general court when they said that the
 
07:31:15.170 --> 07:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
RPS would at the end of the year would
 
07:31:17.690 --> 07:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
have uh information on there that told
 
07:31:20.868 --> 07:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
you how much the on the average uh a
 
07:31:23.930 --> 07:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
person spent on RPS the only problem was
 
07:31:26.330 --> 07:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
they did it in terms of kilowatt cents
 
07:31:28.850 --> 07:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hours this bill all this
 
07:31:31.610 --> 07:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
bill does is it says take that average
 
07:31:34.250 --> 07:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
and apply a dollar amount for the
 
07:31:36.830 --> 07:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
previous year so for instance if we if
 
07:31:39.468 --> 07:31:39.478 align:start position:0%
this was in effect last year we would
 
07:31:43.968 --> 07:31:43.978 align:start position:0%
know that in 2022 that
 
07:31:48.048 --> 07:31:48.058 align:start position:0%
the average person spent about 39 on
 
07:31:49.788 --> 07:31:49.798 align:start position:0%
their electric bill for the RPS program
 
07:31:53.448 --> 07:31:53.458 align:start position:0%
if they average 625 kilowatt hours
 
07:31:55.730 --> 07:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
by putting that information on the bill
 
07:31:57.890 --> 07:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
it gives more visibility more
 
07:32:00.590 --> 07:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
transparency to your electric bill so
 
07:32:02.628 --> 07:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
someone can say oh gee I averaged about
 
07:32:04.368 --> 07:32:04.378 align:start position:0%
twice that much last year so I probably
 
07:32:07.670 --> 07:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
spent about I'll say 78 dollars just it
 
07:32:09.650 --> 07:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for them to see a dollar
 
07:32:12.230 --> 07:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
amount versus point zero zero zero six
 
07:32:14.090 --> 07:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
four cents per kilowatt hour that's all
 
07:32:16.190 --> 07:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does it does it at no cost to
 
07:32:18.590 --> 07:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer all the utilities agreed to
 
07:32:22.670 --> 07:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
it doe agrees to it and I think please
 
07:32:26.150 --> 07:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
press the green button to pass this bill
 
07:32:28.070 --> 07:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we can have transparency and make it
 
07:32:29.330 --> 07:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
easier for people to know what they're
 
07:32:31.310 --> 07:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
spending on on their electric bill thank
 
07:32:33.350 --> 07:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker
 
07:32:35.930 --> 07:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the
 
07:32:38.390 --> 07:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
majority report of Auto pass has amended
 
07:32:41.510 --> 07:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 251. are you ready for the
 
07:32:41.520 --> 07:32:42.410 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 251. are you ready for the
question

07:32:42.410 --> 07:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:32:42.420 --> 07:32:43.788 align:start position:0%
question
although

07:32:43.788 --> 07:32:43.798 align:start position:0%
although
 
07:32:46.850 --> 07:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
division has been requested members take
 
07:33:02.628 --> 07:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:08.048 --> 07:33:08.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:10.250 --> 07:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney has requested a
 
07:33:12.230 --> 07:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently seconded
 
07:33:14.750 --> 07:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
07:33:57.230 --> 07:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:59.448 --> 07:33:59.458 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
07:34:00.890 --> 07:34:00.900 align:start position:0%
committee report of ought to pass that
 
07:34:03.708 --> 07:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment on House Bill 251. this is a
 
07:34:05.810 --> 07:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
roll call vote care recognizes
 
07:34:06.890 --> 07:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
representative Corman for a
 
07:34:11.448 --> 07:34:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:13.910 --> 07:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker
 
07:34:16.910 --> 07:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
and as a math guy I kind of wish I could
 
07:34:20.390 --> 07:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
be doing this Pi on March 14th
 
07:34:24.048 --> 07:34:24.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:25.850 --> 07:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
of compliance with the renewable
 
07:34:28.850 --> 07:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard that would appear on
 
07:34:32.330 --> 07:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
each customer's bill is just that an
 
07:34:34.610 --> 07:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
estimate based on the average
 
07:34:38.448 --> 07:34:38.458 align:start position:0%
electricity usage over all customers
 
07:34:41.330 --> 07:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
and if I know that for any individual
 
07:34:43.788 --> 07:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
customer this estimate could bear no
 
07:34:47.030 --> 07:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
relation to that customer's actual usage
 
07:34:49.430 --> 07:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
which would make it misleading
 
07:34:52.128 --> 07:34:52.138 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the bill sent to each
 
07:34:54.590 --> 07:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
customer would contain information about
 
07:34:57.288 --> 07:34:57.298 align:start position:0%
only the cost of compliance with the
 
07:34:59.448 --> 07:34:59.458 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and nothing
 
07:35:02.030 --> 07:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
about the benefits that the renewable
 
07:35:04.548 --> 07:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard confers upon all
 
07:35:04.558 --> 07:35:05.868 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard confers upon all
customers

07:35:05.868 --> 07:35:05.878 align:start position:0%
customers
 
07:35:08.690 --> 07:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
and this is the last one if I know that
 
07:35:11.170 --> 07:35:11.180 align:start position:0%
including only one-sided information
 
07:35:13.910 --> 07:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
introduces bias into the electric
 
07:35:16.910 --> 07:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
utility bills that every customer in New
 
07:35:19.430 --> 07:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would receive then Mr Speaker
 
07:35:23.090 --> 07:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
would I press the red button and vote no
 
07:35:24.948 --> 07:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
care recognized representative votes for
 
07:35:26.628 --> 07:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
a parliamentary inquiry
 
07:35:28.670 --> 07:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
07:35:30.948 --> 07:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
know that the buyer of any product wants
 
07:35:34.070 --> 07:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
to know the cost of what they are buying
 
07:35:35.868 --> 07:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill simply
 
07:35:38.270 --> 07:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
places on their December electric bill
 
07:35:41.990 --> 07:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
the average cost in dollars and cents
 
07:35:44.270 --> 07:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
to comply with the renewable portfolio
 
07:35:44.280 --> 07:35:45.708 align:start position:0%
to comply with the renewable portfolio
standard

07:35:45.708 --> 07:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
standard
 
07:35:47.570 --> 07:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that transparency
 
07:35:50.090 --> 07:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
for government mandated programs should
 
07:35:53.448 --> 07:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
be of Paramount importance to every New
 
07:35:55.610 --> 07:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen would I press the
 
07:35:57.890 --> 07:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
green button to shine a light on our
 
07:36:00.890 --> 07:36:00.900 align:start position:0%

07:36:02.690 --> 07:36:02.700 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:37:51.948 --> 07:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
colleagues oh yeah I'll take this off

colleagues I come before you to impose
 
07:37:57.770 --> 07:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
the OTP motion for house bill 281.
 
07:37:59.690 --> 07:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges of presenting
 
07:38:01.850 --> 07:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
energy bills is that sometimes the
 
07:38:05.150 --> 07:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
topics are dry and complex and it is up
 
07:38:07.190 --> 07:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
to us to break them down so that they
 
07:38:10.250 --> 07:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
can be understood it is also up to us to
 
07:38:12.170 --> 07:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
keep you from falling asleep
 
07:38:15.708 --> 07:38:15.718 align:start position:0%
I shall try to do my best on this doozy
 
07:38:17.270 --> 07:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
of a bill
 
07:38:20.448 --> 07:38:20.458 align:start position:0%
every two years the utilities must file
 
07:38:23.690 --> 07:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
for puc review and approval of something
 
07:38:27.410 --> 07:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
called leased cost integrated resource
 
07:38:27.420 --> 07:38:28.368 align:start position:0%
called leased cost integrated resource
plan

07:38:28.368 --> 07:38:28.378 align:start position:0%
plan
 
07:38:30.590 --> 07:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
the review must occur by way of an
 
07:38:32.570 --> 07:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding which means that
 
07:38:35.448 --> 07:38:35.458 align:start position:0%
the Advocates and anyone who has
 
07:38:37.430 --> 07:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
interest in the proceeding can
 
07:38:37.440 --> 07:38:39.288 align:start position:0%
interest in the proceeding can
participate

07:38:39.288 --> 07:38:39.298 align:start position:0%
participate
 
07:38:42.530 --> 07:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
this policy also acts as a review of
 
07:38:45.230 --> 07:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
resource development decisions before
 
07:38:48.310 --> 07:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
they occur as a way to control
 
07:38:51.770 --> 07:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
exorbitant utility investment
 
07:38:54.170 --> 07:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
all utility spending decisions from
 
07:38:56.628 --> 07:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
wires down the street to deployment of
 
07:38:59.750 --> 07:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
advanced meters to the construction of a
 
07:39:02.690 --> 07:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
huge pipeline must be looked at with
 
07:39:05.628 --> 07:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
regard to the big picture
 
07:39:09.170 --> 07:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
so the least cost integrated integrated
 
07:39:11.270 --> 07:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
resource plan explains the big picture
 
07:39:14.030 --> 07:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
and the utilities must prove that the
 
07:39:17.150 --> 07:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
plan is managed in a manner that saves
 
07:39:18.890 --> 07:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
customers money
 
07:39:21.468 --> 07:39:21.478 align:start position:0%
they must do this while still advancing
 
07:39:24.048 --> 07:39:24.058 align:start position:0%

okay so what's that
 
07:39:33.288 --> 07:39:33.298 align:start position:0%
as set forth in RSA 378 37 it is to
 
07:39:35.570 --> 07:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
quote meet the energy needs of the
 
07:39:37.910 --> 07:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
citizens and businesses of the state at
 
07:39:40.850 --> 07:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
the lowest reasonable cost while
 
07:39:43.010 --> 07:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
providing for the reliability and
 
07:39:45.468 --> 07:39:45.478 align:start position:0%
diversity of energy sources
 
07:39:48.610 --> 07:39:48.620 align:start position:0%
to maximize the cost of of efficiency
 
07:39:51.830 --> 07:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
energy or to effective Energy Efficiency
 
07:39:55.368 --> 07:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
and other demand I'm sorry and other
 
07:39:58.490 --> 07:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
demand sides resources and to protect
 
07:40:01.070 --> 07:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
the safety and health of the citizens
 
07:40:03.708 --> 07:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
and the future supplies of resources
 
07:40:05.448 --> 07:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
with consideration of the financial
 
07:40:08.150 --> 07:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
stability of the state's utilities now
 
07:40:10.310 --> 07:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's quite a mouthful
 
07:40:13.548 --> 07:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
but it's a reasonable moderate and
 
07:40:16.850 --> 07:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
successful policy that protects all
 
07:40:20.150 --> 07:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
this is not just homework that the
 
07:40:23.868 --> 07:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
utilities have to do by Statute they are
 
07:40:26.868 --> 07:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
required to submit a detailed leased
 
07:40:29.390 --> 07:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
cost plan that looks at the big picture
 
07:40:32.570 --> 07:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
and that proves that their proposal is
 
07:40:36.708 --> 07:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
both cost effective and a good idea
 
07:40:39.410 --> 07:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
the utilities must also look at
 
07:40:41.750 --> 07:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
protections for our environment
 
07:40:44.990 --> 07:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
and yes sometimes this may theoretically
 
07:40:47.270 --> 07:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
mean that even whales need to be
 
07:40:47.280 --> 07:40:48.468 align:start position:0%
mean that even whales need to be
considered

07:40:48.468 --> 07:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
considered
 
07:40:50.628 --> 07:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
because the utilities are required by
 
07:40:52.910 --> 07:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
law to look at the big picture in
 
07:40:52.920 --> 07:40:54.590 align:start position:0%
law to look at the big picture in
totality

07:40:54.590 --> 07:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
totality
 
07:40:56.628 --> 07:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
they must also look at protections for
 
07:40:58.128 --> 07:40:58.138 align:start position:0%
the health of citizens and they must
 
07:41:00.410 --> 07:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
provide assurance that the lease cost
 
07:41:02.510 --> 07:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
plan is used to maximize Energy
 
07:41:06.070 --> 07:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
Efficiency all again at the least cost
 
07:41:09.170 --> 07:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
it sounds like a win-win to rate payers
 
07:41:10.368 --> 07:41:10.378 align:start position:0%
for me
 
07:41:13.490 --> 07:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
why would anyone throw away these very
 
07:41:16.730 --> 07:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
important considerations and protections
 
07:41:20.750 --> 07:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
is the process a little outdated yes the
 
07:41:22.968 --> 07:41:22.978 align:start position:0%
integrated planning statute was adopted
 
07:41:26.510 --> 07:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
in 1990 it could definitely stand to be
 
07:41:30.468 --> 07:41:30.478 align:start position:0%
updated but not nuked
 
07:41:32.628 --> 07:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
you might have read in the calendar that
 
07:41:34.368 --> 07:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
quote the principal reason for the
 
07:41:37.310 --> 07:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
statute no longer exists thus these
 
07:41:39.230 --> 07:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
plans are no longer being submitted and
 
07:41:39.240 --> 07:41:40.548 align:start position:0%
plans are no longer being submitted and
reviewed

07:41:40.548 --> 07:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
07:41:44.390 --> 07:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
this statement is quite frankly false
 
07:41:47.868 --> 07:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
least cost plans are still in are still
 
07:41:51.708 --> 07:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
being submitted to the puc and they are
 
07:41:54.830 --> 07:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
still being reviewed eversource recently
 
07:41:56.570 --> 07:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
had a hearing with the puc on their
 
07:41:59.208 --> 07:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
leased cost plan they have to it is
 
07:42:01.548 --> 07:42:01.558 align:start position:0%
required by current law
 
07:42:04.548 --> 07:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
but this bill proposes to eliminate the
 
07:42:07.390 --> 07:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
entire process and replace it with
 
07:42:12.410 --> 07:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
nothing not a zilch Zippo not a debt a
 
07:42:14.090 --> 07:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
darn thing
 
07:42:17.690 --> 07:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
we consumers and rate payers would lose
 
07:42:20.810 --> 07:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
all protections we wouldn't even be able
 
07:42:23.390 --> 07:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
to participate in the process there
 
07:42:25.190 --> 07:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
would be no guarantees that the
 
07:42:27.830 --> 07:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
utilities would truly pursue a least
 
07:42:31.490 --> 07:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
cost option for their projects and you
 
07:42:34.610 --> 07:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
know who who any higher rates would be
 
07:42:37.850 --> 07:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
passed on to right yep say hello to the
 
07:42:40.310 --> 07:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
rate player Ray payers
 
07:42:43.310 --> 07:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
the very important purpose of these
 
07:42:46.910 --> 07:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
least cost integrative resource plans is
 
07:42:48.948 --> 07:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
as an oversight to make sure the
 
07:42:51.890 --> 07:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
utilities are doing their job safely and
 
07:42:57.110 --> 07:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
effectively without wasting our money it
 
07:42:59.208 --> 07:42:59.218 align:start position:0%
is as simple as that
 
07:43:01.430 --> 07:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
when I was young my mother would use the
 
07:43:03.230 --> 07:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
Expression throwing the baby out with
 
07:43:04.490 --> 07:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
the bath water
 
07:43:06.650 --> 07:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
as a child I was horrified at the
 
07:43:09.110 --> 07:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
thought that anyone would ever do that
 
07:43:11.150 --> 07:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
as I got older I realized that the
 
07:43:13.850 --> 07:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
expression actually means don't discard
 
07:43:15.770 --> 07:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
The Good by throwing all of something
 
07:43:15.780 --> 07:43:17.090 align:start position:0%
The Good by throwing all of something
away

07:43:17.090 --> 07:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
away
 
07:43:19.368 --> 07:43:19.378 align:start position:0%
I am still horrified that anyone would
 
07:43:22.070 --> 07:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
ever do that and I am horrified that
 
07:43:24.948 --> 07:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill intends to do
 
07:43:26.930 --> 07:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
by getting rid of the least cost
 
07:43:29.930 --> 07:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plan this proposed
 
07:43:32.990 --> 07:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
Bill throws out a very important baby
 
07:43:36.048 --> 07:43:36.058 align:start position:0%
that is responsible for oversight and
 
07:43:38.810 --> 07:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
customer protections and guarantees with
 
07:43:40.190 --> 07:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
the utilities
 
07:43:43.128 --> 07:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
let us all save this precious baby and
 
07:43:46.190 --> 07:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
vote no to OTP in order that another
 
07:43:49.368 --> 07:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
more reasonable motion can be made
 
07:43:51.410 --> 07:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and Mr Speaker I'd like to
 
07:43:56.208 --> 07:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:58.490 --> 07:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
a rogue we're down to our final speaker
 
07:44:00.948 --> 07:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested
 
07:44:03.530 --> 07:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
and it is officially seconded so members

thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:44:17.650 --> 07:44:17.660 align:start position:0%
HB 281 repeals RSA
 
07:44:22.190 --> 07:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
378 37 through 40.
 
07:44:25.250 --> 07:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
it concerns the policies plans and
 
07:44:28.850 --> 07:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
compliances compliance for filing lease
 
07:44:31.910 --> 07:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
cost integrated resource plans which are
 
07:44:36.288 --> 07:44:36.298 align:start position:0%
filed by the utilities with the puc at a
 
07:44:38.628 --> 07:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
minimum of every two years
 
07:44:41.930 --> 07:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
now some may consider it a cure for
 
07:44:41.940 --> 07:44:43.368 align:start position:0%
now some may consider it a cure for
insomnia

07:44:43.368 --> 07:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
insomnia
 
07:44:46.670 --> 07:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
but that wasn't the purpose or isn't the
 
07:44:49.430 --> 07:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
purpose primary purpose of the bill or
 
07:44:52.670 --> 07:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
of the law the primary purpose is to
 
07:44:55.910 --> 07:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
have utilities justify placement of
 
07:44:58.310 --> 07:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
their new production facilities
 
07:45:00.948 --> 07:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
why why do they need to do that
 
07:45:05.448 --> 07:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
because utilities made money
 
07:45:08.990 --> 07:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
and more money by citing decisions than
 
07:45:12.230 --> 07:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
virtually any other major production
 
07:45:14.750 --> 07:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
decision they made
 
07:45:17.690 --> 07:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
but then something happened
 
07:45:17.700 --> 07:45:19.730 align:start position:0%
but then something happened
divestment

07:45:19.730 --> 07:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
divestment
 
07:45:22.730 --> 07:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
utilities no longer own their production
 
07:45:22.740 --> 07:45:24.530 align:start position:0%
utilities no longer own their production
facilities

07:45:24.530 --> 07:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
07:45:29.170 --> 07:45:29.180 align:start position:0%
so the primary reason for
 
07:45:34.850 --> 07:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:37.670 --> 07:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
now are there some dogs and cats issues
 
07:45:41.090 --> 07:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
in there that still could be attended to
 
07:45:43.610 --> 07:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
yes there are
 
07:45:46.128 --> 07:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
but then something else happened
 
07:45:49.610 --> 07:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
07:45:49.620 --> 07:45:52.788 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
RSA

07:45:52.788 --> 07:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:57.890 --> 07:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
12 P colon 7 and 7A created a division
 
07:46:01.490 --> 07:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
of policy and programs that creates a
 
07:46:04.730 --> 07:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
10-year energy strategy that's updated
 
07:46:06.890 --> 07:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
every three years
 
07:46:09.230 --> 07:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
and it deals with these dogs and cats
 
07:46:12.830 --> 07:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
issues and the puc deals with them when
 
07:46:16.330 --> 07:46:16.340 align:start position:0%
they entertain the rates the utilities
 
07:46:20.330 --> 07:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
have to uh set when they bring the when
 
07:46:23.150 --> 07:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
they bring the cases in front of them
 
07:46:23.160 --> 07:46:25.128 align:start position:0%
they bring the cases in front of them
so

07:46:25.128 --> 07:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:46:31.330 --> 07:46:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:35.208 --> 07:46:35.218 align:start position:0%
creates a division of policy and and
 
07:46:38.690 --> 07:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
programs but the policy plan deals with
 
07:46:41.270 --> 07:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
protection reliability and modernization
 
07:46:43.270 --> 07:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
of infrastructure
 
07:46:45.890 --> 07:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
including connectivity of new production
 
07:46:48.350 --> 07:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
and even Renewables
 
07:46:52.250 --> 07:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is this particular
 
07:46:56.150 --> 07:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
part of our law is outdated and not
 
07:47:01.850 --> 07:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:04.788 --> 07:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
07:47:08.930 --> 07:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 281 this is a roll call vote
 
07:47:11.628 --> 07:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the questions
 
07:47:11.638 --> 07:47:12.890 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the questions
yes

07:47:12.890 --> 07:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:47:17.390 --> 07:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:19.070 --> 07:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you for
 
07:47:21.368 --> 07:47:21.378 align:start position:0%
taking along my question
 
07:47:23.690 --> 07:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
as you know I'm a former puc
 
07:47:25.430 --> 07:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner and with the exception of

07:47:35.868 --> 07:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
that would you believe me when I say
 
07:47:38.330 --> 07:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
these plans are no longer serve any
 
07:47:41.448 --> 07:47:41.458 align:start position:0%
useful purpose whatsoever I asked him if
 
07:47:43.070 --> 07:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
he would believe me when I said they
 
07:47:46.368 --> 07:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
served no useful purpose whatsoever
 
07:47:48.948 --> 07:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
yes I believe you they serve no useful
 
07:47:51.650 --> 07:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
purpose we have other mechanisms to deal
 
07:47:53.208 --> 07:47:53.218 align:start position:0%

07:49:12.288 --> 07:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that reasonable
 
07:49:14.930 --> 07:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
ratepayer costs are reliant on the twin
 
07:49:18.048 --> 07:49:18.058 align:start position:0%
pillars of rate cases and least cost
 
07:49:20.510 --> 07:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
integrative resource planning and
 
07:49:22.610 --> 07:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
without the latter there will be even

07:49:31.850 --> 07:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
if I know that least cost integrated
 
07:49:34.548 --> 07:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
resource planning is one of the very few
 
07:49:36.888 --> 07:49:36.898 align:start position:0%
statutes that actually require the
 
07:49:39.310 --> 07:49:39.320 align:start position:0%

07:49:54.288 --> 07:49:54.298 align:start position:0%
believe that these cost integrated
 
07:49:56.868 --> 07:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
resource planning should be renewed
 
07:49:59.888 --> 07:49:59.898 align:start position:0%
refined but definitely not eliminated
 
07:50:02.690 --> 07:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
what I now press

07:50:29.628 --> 07:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that the job of the
 
07:50:32.270 --> 07:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission is to make
 
07:50:34.850 --> 07:50:34.860 align:start position:0%

07:58:31.968 --> 07:58:31.978 align:start position:0%
attending the meetings the purpose of a
 
07:58:33.888 --> 07:58:33.898 align:start position:0%
study or commission is to recommend
 
07:58:33.898 --> 07:58:35.448 align:start position:0%
study or commission is to recommend
legislation

07:58:35.448 --> 07:58:35.458 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
07:58:38.030 --> 07:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
and in this case it would be a carbon
 
07:58:38.040 --> 07:58:38.868 align:start position:0%
and in this case it would be a carbon
tax

07:58:38.868 --> 07:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
tax
 
07:58:40.968 --> 07:58:40.978 align:start position:0%
we should be trying to reduce our
 
07:58:43.250 --> 07:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
constituents financial burden and not
 
07:58:45.650 --> 07:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
add to it with a carbon tax so please
 
07:58:49.010 --> 07:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:56.810 --> 07:58:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:59.510 --> 07:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:59:04.128 --> 07:59:04.138 align:start position:0%
I Rise to support HB 372 a bill
 
07:59:06.110 --> 07:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
that proposes a commission to study the
 
07:59:08.388 --> 07:59:08.398 align:start position:0%
effects of carbon system carbon pricing
 
07:59:11.570 --> 07:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
systems on our state
 
07:59:13.368 --> 07:59:13.378 align:start position:0%
let me just say from the outset that
 
07:59:15.350 --> 07:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is not intended to change the
 
07:59:17.810 --> 07:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
tax structure of New Hampshire nor is it
 
07:59:20.990 --> 07:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
intended to send a message that we as a
 
07:59:23.750 --> 07:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislature support carbon taxes
 
07:59:26.090 --> 07:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
either of those two intentions would be
 
07:59:28.368 --> 07:59:28.378 align:start position:0%
foolish I'm sure you would agree
 
07:59:31.190 --> 07:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
but let's face the facts
 
07:59:33.410 --> 07:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
the world is changing rapidly whether we
 
07:59:34.850 --> 07:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
like it or not
 
07:59:37.250 --> 07:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
and the likelihood of carbon pricing
 
07:59:39.948 --> 07:59:39.958 align:start position:0%
systems coming into Force in our country
 
07:59:41.690 --> 07:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
has never been more clear despite
 
07:59:41.700 --> 07:59:43.430 align:start position:0%
has never been more clear despite
Passage

07:59:43.430 --> 07:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
07:59:45.590 --> 07:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
of the groundbreaking legislation last
 
07:59:47.150 --> 07:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
year by the Biden Administration the
 
07:59:49.010 --> 07:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
build back better Act
 
07:59:50.570 --> 07:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
than the inflation reduction act
 
07:59:52.490 --> 07:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
intended to jump start a clean energy
 
07:59:55.368 --> 07:59:55.378 align:start position:0%
economy and move us away from our
 
07:59:57.110 --> 07:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
dependence on fossil fuels whose
 
07:59:59.510 --> 07:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
combustion has already
 
08:00:01.368 --> 08:00:01.378 align:start position:0%
altered the global temperature and
 
08:00:03.590 --> 08:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
threatens to continue to destabilize the
 
08:00:06.468 --> 08:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
climate in historically unprecedented
 
08:00:06.478 --> 08:00:07.788 align:start position:0%
climate in historically unprecedented
ways

08:00:07.788 --> 08:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
ways
 
08:00:09.830 --> 08:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
why do I say that despite the passage of
 
08:00:11.388 --> 08:00:11.398 align:start position:0%
the Biden administration's ambitious
 
08:00:14.330 --> 08:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
subsidies and tax credits the case has
 
08:00:16.968 --> 08:00:16.978 align:start position:0%
never been better for a federal carbon
 
08:00:19.610 --> 08:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
price in our country after all the
 
08:00:21.048 --> 08:00:21.058 align:start position:0%
government is spending millions of
 
08:00:22.190 --> 08:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
dollars on the project of
 
08:00:25.610 --> 08:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
decarbonization 400 billion in the next
 
08:00:27.948 --> 08:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
decade to be more precise
 
08:00:29.930 --> 08:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
that level of spending will reduce our
 
08:00:32.448 --> 08:00:32.458 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030
 
08:00:34.788 --> 08:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
according to the experts the problem is
 
08:00:36.830 --> 08:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
that that level of spending only goes so
 
08:00:40.010 --> 08:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
far in meeting our goal of 50 reductions
 
08:00:44.930 --> 08:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
by 2030 and Net Zero carbon by 2050.
 
08:00:47.810 --> 08:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
and it's the last 10 percent of
 
08:00:49.670 --> 08:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas reductions that is the
 
08:00:52.730 --> 08:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
heaviest lift so to speak in Industries
 
08:00:56.330 --> 08:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
like cement and steel and Aviation
 
08:00:58.368 --> 08:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
so that is why groups like the
 
08:01:00.770 --> 08:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
conservative committee for a responsible
 
08:01:04.128 --> 08:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
federal budget are proposing a forty
 
08:01:06.650 --> 08:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
dollar per ton carbon price that would
 
08:01:08.448 --> 08:01:08.458 align:start position:0%
slash emissions an additional 10
 
08:01:10.190 --> 08:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
percentage points beyond the Biden
 
08:01:10.200 --> 08:01:15.410 align:start position:0%
percentage points beyond the Biden
program

08:01:15.410 --> 08:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:17.570 --> 08:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
putting us in line with our commitments
 
08:01:19.910 --> 08:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
to reduce carbon dioxide and other
 
08:01:22.670 --> 08:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases to ensure
 
08:01:24.590 --> 08:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
the stability of the climate for the
 
08:01:26.930 --> 08:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
next generation of Americans
 
08:01:29.868 --> 08:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
altering the tax structure by including
 
08:01:31.730 --> 08:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
a carbon price does not necessarily mean
 
08:01:33.888 --> 08:01:33.898 align:start position:0%
greater revenues for a government or
 
08:01:35.628 --> 08:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
greater burdens for individuals or
 
08:01:35.638 --> 08:01:37.788 align:start position:0%
greater burdens for individuals or
businesses

08:01:37.788 --> 08:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
08:01:41.150 --> 08:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
if paired with cuts and other taxes or
 
08:01:44.628 --> 08:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
and means-tested rebates
 
08:01:46.788 --> 08:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
if done in this way a revenue neutral
 
08:01:49.670 --> 08:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
way a carbon price is simply a way of
 
08:01:51.708 --> 08:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
leveling the playing field among energy
 
08:01:54.288 --> 08:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
generating sources to bring the costs of
 
08:01:56.208 --> 08:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel combustion the hidden
 
08:01:57.888 --> 08:01:57.898 align:start position:0%
subsidy that we paid the fossil fuel
 
08:02:00.230 --> 08:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
industry for burning their product
 
08:02:02.270 --> 08:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
onto the book so to speak instead of
 
08:02:04.730 --> 08:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
hiding it under the rug and imposing
 
08:02:07.010 --> 08:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
those costs on our Public Health
 
08:02:09.530 --> 08:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
and the welfare and livelihood of our
 
08:02:09.540 --> 08:02:12.468 align:start position:0%
and the welfare and livelihood of our
children

08:02:12.468 --> 08:02:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:14.930 --> 08:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
the benefit of carbon pricing also from
 
08:02:16.788 --> 08:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
a Libertarian point of view
 
08:02:18.170 --> 08:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
is that instead of the government
 
08:02:20.270 --> 08:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing winners by dangling
 
08:02:20.280 --> 08:02:21.650 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing winners by dangling
money

08:02:21.650 --> 08:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
money
 
08:02:23.750 --> 08:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
in front of individuals and households
 
08:02:25.850 --> 08:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
the tax system is a Level Playing Field
 
08:02:27.888 --> 08:02:27.898 align:start position:0%
that everybody plays on
 
08:02:29.750 --> 08:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
and if your concern is out of control
 
08:02:32.150 --> 08:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
federal spending
 
08:02:34.430 --> 08:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
then basing our carbon dioxide reduction
 
08:02:34.440 --> 08:02:35.810 align:start position:0%
then basing our carbon dioxide reduction
policy

08:02:35.810 --> 08:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
policy
 
08:02:38.930 --> 08:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
on an economy-wide carbon price also has
 
08:02:42.350 --> 08:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
clear advantages over the next big green
 
08:02:43.610 --> 08:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
New Deal
 
08:02:45.468 --> 08:02:45.478 align:start position:0%
package of spending that we would need
 
08:02:47.990 --> 08:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
to meet our goals
 
08:02:49.610 --> 08:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
other countries have already reached
 
08:02:51.230 --> 08:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
that conclusion
 
08:02:54.170 --> 08:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly the biggest driver of our
 
08:02:56.990 --> 08:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
own move to carbon pricing will be the
 
08:02:57.000 --> 08:02:58.310 align:start position:0%
own move to carbon pricing will be the
fact

08:02:58.310 --> 08:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
fact
 
08:03:00.288 --> 08:03:00.298 align:start position:0%
that major trading partners such as the
 
08:03:03.948 --> 08:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
European Union Canada and China
 
08:03:06.230 --> 08:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
have moved to economy-wide carbon
 
08:03:08.930 --> 08:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
pricing systems on their own and started
 
08:03:10.730 --> 08:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
to enact tariffs
 
08:03:13.368 --> 08:03:13.378 align:start position:0%
on Goods coming into their country from
 
08:03:14.990 --> 08:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
countries such as ours that have no
 
08:03:17.868 --> 08:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing system in place
 
08:03:20.270 --> 08:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
the pressure to match with those trading
 
08:03:22.070 --> 08:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
partners will continue to grow in coming
 
08:03:22.080 --> 08:03:23.448 align:start position:0%
partners will continue to grow in coming
years

08:03:23.448 --> 08:03:23.458 align:start position:0%
years
 
08:03:26.388 --> 08:03:26.398 align:start position:0%
and that is why leaders from companies
 
08:03:29.628 --> 08:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
such as Conoco Phillips Exelon Exxon
 
08:03:32.708 --> 08:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
Mobil Ford Motor Company General Motors
 
08:03:36.590 --> 08:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hannon Armstrong IBM and others are
 
08:03:39.110 --> 08:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
calling for a carbon price and rebate
 
08:03:41.150 --> 08:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
system that would be preferable for them
 
08:03:43.070 --> 08:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
08:03:44.628 --> 08:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
further subsidies and government
 
08:03:48.110 --> 08:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
spending on decarbonizing our economy
 
08:03:50.330 --> 08:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
so by studying the likely impacts of
 
08:03:52.968 --> 08:03:52.978 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing and recommending measures
 
08:03:55.128 --> 08:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
to place our businesses and people ahead
 
08:03:56.628 --> 08:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
of the Curve
 
08:03:58.730 --> 08:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
we would be carrying out our duty as
 
08:04:00.410 --> 08:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
Leaders instead of
 
08:04:02.750 --> 08:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
insisting that reality match our
 
08:04:05.330 --> 08:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
ideological Vision despite all the signs
 
08:04:07.788 --> 08:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
showing the exact opposite
 
08:04:09.530 --> 08:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's leadership it's what our
 
08:04:11.510 --> 08:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
constituents want and it's what they
 
08:04:11.520 --> 08:04:14.208 align:start position:0%
constituents want and it's what they
deserve

08:04:14.208 --> 08:04:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:16.128 --> 08:04:16.138 align:start position:0%
so please vote Yes
 
08:04:19.128 --> 08:04:19.138 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on HB 372 to ensure New
 
08:04:21.288 --> 08:04:21.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is on The Cutting Edge instead
 
08:04:23.628 --> 08:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
of the lagging edge of the changes that
 
08:04:25.968 --> 08:04:25.978 align:start position:0%
may be coming that will affect every
 
08:04:28.070 --> 08:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
corner of our economy thank you Mr
 
08:04:30.170 --> 08:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
Speaker the motion I call for our
 
08:04:30.180 --> 08:04:31.190 align:start position:0%
Speaker the motion I call for our
division

08:04:31.190 --> 08:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
division
 
08:04:34.250 --> 08:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
08:04:37.128 --> 08:04:37.138 align:start position:0%
House Bill 372 a division has been
 
08:04:50.208 --> 08:04:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:52.010 --> 08:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
the senator Paul has requested a roll
 
08:04:56.208 --> 08:04:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:58.430 --> 08:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
08:05:47.448 --> 08:05:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:49.910 --> 08:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
08:05:52.850 --> 08:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
House Bill 372. this is going to be a
 
08:05:55.128 --> 08:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
roll call vote chair recognizes

representative votes for a parliamentary
 
08:05:56.760 --> 08:05:59.448 align:start position:0%
representative votes for a parliamentary
inquiry

08:05:59.448 --> 08:05:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:02.510 --> 08:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
08:06:05.448 --> 08:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
know that 60 of Americans oppose a
 
08:06:07.548 --> 08:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
carbon tax
 
08:06:10.070 --> 08:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that at its core a
 
08:06:13.730 --> 08:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
carbon tax is a transportation tax
 
08:06:15.590 --> 08:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that every good
 
08:06:17.810 --> 08:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
purchased by an American citizen is
 
08:06:20.930 --> 08:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
transported from its maker to the buyer
 
08:06:25.070 --> 08:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
thus driving inflation higher and higher
 
08:06:26.868 --> 08:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
finally if I know
 
08:06:30.708 --> 08:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
that it's not productive to study a tax
 
08:06:33.048 --> 08:06:33.058 align:start position:0%
that's very unlikely to become reality
 
08:06:35.330 --> 08:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
in the foreseeable future
 
08:06:38.090 --> 08:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
what I press the red button
 
08:06:41.208 --> 08:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
to prevent further waste of valuable
 
08:06:44.930 --> 08:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
resources on a
 
08:06:47.448 --> 08:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
on something of dubious quality
 
08:06:49.430 --> 08:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
08:06:51.410 --> 08:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative creation for
 
08:06:56.510 --> 08:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:58.968 --> 08:06:58.978 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
08:07:00.650 --> 08:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
know that the international landscape
 
08:07:02.388 --> 08:07:02.398 align:start position:0%
for carbon pricing has changed
 
08:07:04.070 --> 08:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
substantially since the last time the
 
08:07:06.650 --> 08:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
legislature considered this issue
 
08:07:08.570 --> 08:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
if I know that many countries including
 
08:07:10.610 --> 08:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
our neighbor just to the north currently
 
08:07:12.708 --> 08:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
participate in carbon markets and have
 
08:07:14.270 --> 08:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
instituted or are exploring border
 
08:07:16.730 --> 08:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
adjustments for carbon
 
08:07:18.590 --> 08:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
if I know that these changes are going
 
08:07:20.510 --> 08:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
to impact New Hampshire rate payers and
 
08:07:22.548 --> 08:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
businesses in the future whether we pay
 
08:07:24.410 --> 08:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
attention to them or understand them or
 
08:07:24.420 --> 08:07:26.090 align:start position:0%
attention to them or understand them or
not

08:07:26.090 --> 08:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
not
 
08:07:27.770 --> 08:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
and finally if I understand that this
 
08:07:29.690 --> 08:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
bill is to study the potential impacts
 
08:07:31.788 --> 08:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
of other bodies decisions on New
 
08:07:34.070 --> 08:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire interests not to recommend or
 
08:07:35.690 --> 08:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
even study the possibility of state
 
08:07:37.310 --> 08:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
level legislation
 
08:07:38.990 --> 08:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
and finally if I agree with the great
 
08:07:40.788 --> 08:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
Winston Churchill that failing to plan
 
08:07:43.128 --> 08:07:43.138 align:start position:0%

more than four decades ago the major

fossil fuel producers knew what the rest
 
08:10:44.510 --> 08:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
of us now know as certainty and with
 
08:10:47.150 --> 08:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
widespread scientific consensus we are
 
08:10:49.730 --> 08:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
facing an urgent climate crisis the
 
08:10:51.468 --> 08:10:51.478 align:start position:0%
likes of which modern humans have never
 
08:10:53.048 --> 08:10:53.058 align:start position:0%
before encountered
 
08:10:55.190 --> 08:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
scientists employed by those very
 
08:10:57.410 --> 08:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
companies projected today's temperature
 
08:11:00.530 --> 08:11:00.540 align:start position:0%

working with Congress to mitigate damage
 
08:11:05.208 --> 08:11:05.218 align:start position:0%

a massive cover-up disinformation and
 
08:11:10.128 --> 08:11:10.138 align:start position:0%
fraudulent marketing campaign
 
08:11:13.548 --> 08:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
as a result we lost 40 Years of
 
08:11:15.948 --> 08:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to course correct and must
 
08:11:17.990 --> 08:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
now adopt expensive and burdensome
 
08:11:20.030 --> 08:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
policy changes in order to avoid the
 
08:11:22.910 --> 08:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
worst potential outcome to this crisis
 
08:11:26.388 --> 08:11:26.398 align:start position:0%
even with those actions we our state our

towns our businesses ourselves our kids
 
08:11:31.430 --> 08:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
our grandkids we will face Decades of
 
08:11:34.010 --> 08:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
Damages losses and costs directly
 
08:11:35.690 --> 08:11:35.700 align:start position:0%

08:11:38.868 --> 08:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
after learning of the looming danger
 
08:11:41.330 --> 08:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel companies adopted three main
 
08:11:43.548 --> 08:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
approaches first deny the existence of
 
08:11:45.888 --> 08:11:45.898 align:start position:0%
climate change second if it exists point
 
08:11:48.350 --> 08:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
the blame elsewhere and third shift the
 
08:11:50.388 --> 08:11:50.398 align:start position:0%
burden of combating climate change to
 
08:11:52.190 --> 08:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
the individual rather than to the big
 
08:11:54.650 --> 08:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
corporations to say that climate change
 
08:11:56.990 --> 08:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist or to acknowledge that it
 
08:11:59.150 --> 08:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
exists but deny the direct link between
 
08:12:00.948 --> 08:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
the burning of fossil fuels and global
 
08:12:03.830 --> 08:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
warming is to say that somehow we in
 
08:12:05.810 --> 08:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
this room know more than the brightest
 
08:12:09.048 --> 08:12:09.058 align:start position:0%

08:12:15.590 --> 08:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
with regard to their final tactic I'm a
 
08:12:17.750 --> 08:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
child of the 80s we were taught that it
 
08:12:19.610 --> 08:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
was our generation's responsibility to
 
08:12:22.250 --> 08:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
fix the environmental crisis before us I
 
08:12:23.388 --> 08:12:23.398 align:start position:0%
remember being in the third grade
 
08:12:25.490 --> 08:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
joining a North club and holding bake
 
08:12:27.048 --> 08:12:27.058 align:start position:0%

08:12:29.388 --> 08:12:29.398 align:start position:0%
rainforest to this day I feel guilty if
 
08:12:30.830 --> 08:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm brushing my teeth and I forget to
 
08:12:32.750 --> 08:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
turn the water off or if I show up at
 
08:12:34.610 --> 08:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
the grocery store and forget my reusable
 
08:12:37.010 --> 08:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
bags the member will suspend
 
08:12:39.948 --> 08:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
it is getting awful noisy in here we're
 
08:12:42.288 --> 08:12:42.298 align:start position:0%
down to our last two bills the member
 
08:12:44.150 --> 08:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
has a right to be heard I'm almost done
 
08:12:45.590 --> 08:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
I promise
 
08:12:47.330 --> 08:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
individual efforts are wonderful but
 
08:12:47.340 --> 08:12:47.990 align:start position:0%
individual efforts are wonderful but
what

08:12:47.990 --> 08:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
08:12:50.208 --> 08:12:50.218 align:start position:0%
the fuel companies knew is that these
 
08:12:52.788 --> 08:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
changes on the micro level would never
 
08:12:54.708 --> 08:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
be enough to combat the single biggest
 
08:12:56.810 --> 08:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
contributor to global warming the
 
08:12:59.030 --> 08:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
burning of fossil fuels it's eerily
 
08:13:01.070 --> 08:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
reminiscent to Big tobacco glamorizing
 
08:13:03.230 --> 08:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
cigarette smoking in their marketing or

this medication the cold reality and the
 
08:13:13.010 --> 08:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
facts before us clearly show these
 
08:13:15.468 --> 08:13:15.478 align:start position:0%
companies knew four decades ago that
 
08:13:17.510 --> 08:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
global warming would occur they knew
 
08:13:19.010 --> 08:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
that it was directly linked to fossil
 
08:13:21.048 --> 08:13:21.058 align:start position:0%
fuel consumption and they knew that the
 
08:13:23.330 --> 08:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
only way to mitigate the damage would be
 
08:13:25.610 --> 08:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
policy change on a national and Global
 
08:13:25.620 --> 08:13:26.628 align:start position:0%

08:13:26.628 --> 08:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
level
 
08:13:29.208 --> 08:13:29.218 align:start position:0%
all of us in this room came here to
 
08:13:31.310 --> 08:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
represent the people of New Hampshire
 
08:13:33.288 --> 08:13:33.298 align:start position:0%
we live in a state that will be directly
 
08:13:35.330 --> 08:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
and severely impacted by climate change
 
08:13:37.490 --> 08:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
it is time for New Hampshire to join
 
08:13:39.650 --> 08:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
with other states before us to be an
 
08:13:41.930 --> 08:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
example to the rest of the nation and to
 
08:13:44.690 --> 08:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
step up and speak out in honor of the
 
08:13:46.490 --> 08:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
generations that will follow ours who
 
08:13:48.230 --> 08:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
will face the worst consequences of
 
08:13:50.090 --> 08:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
global warming and to hold these
 
08:13:51.888 --> 08:13:51.898 align:start position:0%
companies accountable in the only manner
 
08:13:54.230 --> 08:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
they will respond to I urge you all to
 
08:13:57.650 --> 08:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
support hcr5 and vote no on itl thank
 
08:13:57.660 --> 08:14:00.288 align:start position:0%

ages Global famine rising sea levels
 
08:14:58.368 --> 08:14:58.378 align:start position:0%

08:15:03.288 --> 08:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
08:15:03.298 --> 08:15:04.788 align:start position:0%

countless
 
08:15:08.270 --> 08:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
so house will be in order
 
08:15:10.190 --> 08:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be short
 
08:15:13.788 --> 08:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
countless so-called experts
 
08:15:16.250 --> 08:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
told us a generation ago
 
08:15:18.888 --> 08:15:18.898 align:start position:0%
that we were about to run out of oil
 
08:15:21.888 --> 08:15:21.898 align:start position:0%
in the 80s the 80s folks like ucal
 
08:15:24.230 --> 08:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
ecology Professor Kenneth Ward many
 
08:15:25.968 --> 08:15:25.978 align:start position:0%
others predicted that we'd run out of
 
08:15:25.978 --> 08:15:26.990 align:start position:0%
others predicted that we'd run out of
crude

08:15:26.990 --> 08:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
crude
 
08:15:29.150 --> 08:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
by the year 2000.
 
08:15:33.350 --> 08:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
in 1989 NASA climate scientist James
 
08:15:35.030 --> 08:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hansen predicted
 
08:15:39.170 --> 08:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
that by 2009 Manhattan would be
 
08:15:39.180 --> 08:15:40.610 align:start position:0%
that by 2009 Manhattan would be
underwater

08:15:40.610 --> 08:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
underwater
 
08:15:44.690 --> 08:15:44.700 align:start position:0%
in 2009 Al Gore
 
08:15:48.048 --> 08:15:48.058 align:start position:0%
predicted that the arctic ice cap would
 
08:15:51.888 --> 08:15:51.898 align:start position:0%
completely melt by 2015.
 
08:15:55.850 --> 08:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
and finally in 2019 climate expert and
 
08:15:57.788 --> 08:15:57.798 align:start position:0%
activist representative
 
08:15:57.798 --> 08:15:59.350 align:start position:0%

Alexandria
 
08:16:02.868 --> 08:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
ocasio-cortez declared without
 
08:16:04.610 --> 08:16:04.620 align:start position:0%

08:16:06.650 --> 08:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
climate action quote
 
08:16:09.048 --> 08:16:09.058 align:start position:0%
the world is going to end in 12 years
 
08:16:12.530 --> 08:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
unquote we could go on and on
 
08:16:14.208 --> 08:16:14.218 align:start position:0%
the truth of the matter is that we did
 
08:16:16.610 --> 08:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
not run out of oil in 2000 and in fact
 
08:16:18.110 --> 08:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
by 2020
 
08:16:21.110 --> 08:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
America had become amazingly energy
 
08:16:22.910 --> 08:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient in the net energy
 
08:16:22.920 --> 08:16:24.468 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient in the net energy
exporter

08:16:24.468 --> 08:16:24.478 align:start position:0%
exporter
 
08:16:26.690 --> 08:16:26.700 align:start position:0%
that is a fact that is not
 
08:16:28.968 --> 08:16:28.978 align:start position:0%
disinformation but sadly dubious
 
08:16:31.610 --> 08:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
Washington energy policies have changed
 
08:16:33.708 --> 08:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
out the last couple years damaging our
 
08:16:35.990 --> 08:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
economy and threatening our national
 
08:16:36.000 --> 08:16:38.510 align:start position:0%
economy and threatening our national
security

08:16:38.510 --> 08:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:40.010 --> 08:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
I just returned from the West Coast
 
08:16:43.610 --> 08:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
where six dollar a six dollar or a
 
08:16:47.388 --> 08:16:47.398 align:start position:0%
gallon gasoline is uh is the norm five
 
08:16:49.910 --> 08:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
to six dollars that hurts the poor that
 
08:16:52.788 --> 08:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
hurts the poor more than anyone
 
08:16:55.548 --> 08:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
so most of all
 
08:16:57.530 --> 08:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
and most of us including the energy
 
08:16:59.628 --> 08:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
companies favor a reasonable and
 
08:17:02.030 --> 08:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
tempered transition away from fossil
 
08:17:04.730 --> 08:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
fuels as opposed to a radical break
 
08:17:07.548 --> 08:17:07.558 align:start position:0%
indeed these reviled energy companies
 
08:17:09.410 --> 08:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
are at the Forefront
 
08:17:12.170 --> 08:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
if you don't know this you should these
 
08:17:13.850 --> 08:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
energy companies have been at the
 
08:17:13.860 --> 08:17:15.170 align:start position:0%
energy companies have been at the
Forefront

08:17:15.170 --> 08:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
Forefront
 
08:17:17.628 --> 08:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
of energy research and developing
 
08:17:20.690 --> 08:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and Renewables this is the
 
08:17:22.250 --> 08:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
energy companies that we're reviling
 
08:17:24.110 --> 08:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
that we want to shake down
 
08:17:26.868 --> 08:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
so windmills and the like do have their
 
08:17:28.490 --> 08:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
place and the Energy Mix but there are
 
08:17:30.590 --> 08:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
other green sources here in New
 
08:17:33.288 --> 08:17:33.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Seabrook station has provided
 
08:17:36.170 --> 08:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
an amazing amount of green energy since
 
08:17:40.670 --> 08:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
1990 with zero zero carbon emissions and
 
08:17:43.190 --> 08:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
yet ironically climate radicals have
 
08:17:44.990 --> 08:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
done everything they could to hinder or
 
08:17:46.150 --> 08:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
shut down
 
08:17:48.888 --> 08:17:48.898 align:start position:0%
seabrook's operation going back to the
 
08:17:48.898 --> 08:17:50.270 align:start position:0%
seabrook's operation going back to the
70s

08:17:50.270 --> 08:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
70s
 
08:17:52.128 --> 08:17:52.138 align:start position:0%
also at this moment there are hundreds
 
08:17:54.830 --> 08:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
and hundreds of commercial aircraft I
 
08:17:57.170 --> 08:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
just got off one crisscrossing our
 
08:17:57.180 --> 08:17:58.968 align:start position:0%
just got off one crisscrossing our
country

08:17:58.968 --> 08:17:58.978 align:start position:0%
country
 
08:18:02.570 --> 08:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
they need jet fuel they can't fly on
 
08:18:05.448 --> 08:18:05.458 align:start position:0%
batteries so there's a place for
 
08:18:07.788 --> 08:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
Resolutions in this body
 
08:18:10.730 --> 08:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
the HR 7 resolution supporting Social
 
08:18:13.070 --> 08:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
Security came out of our state federal
 
08:18:13.080 --> 08:18:14.570 align:start position:0%
Security came out of our state federal
committee

08:18:14.570 --> 08:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
committee
 
08:18:17.750 --> 08:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
with unanimous support and it passed
 
08:18:20.208 --> 08:18:20.218 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly at the last session here
 
08:18:21.888 --> 08:18:21.898 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand this particular
 
08:18:21.898 --> 08:18:23.230 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand this particular
resolution

08:18:23.230 --> 08:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
08:18:25.788 --> 08:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
hcr5 looks to be
 
08:18:25.798 --> 08:18:26.990 align:start position:0%
hcr5 looks to be
not

08:18:26.990 --> 08:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
08:18:29.990 --> 08:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
it was not unanimous out of committee
 
08:18:31.788 --> 08:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
it looks to be overly partisan and
 
08:18:31.798 --> 08:18:33.170 align:start position:0%
it looks to be overly partisan and
contentious

08:18:33.170 --> 08:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
contentious
 
08:18:37.610 --> 08:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
so the hope is that colleagues will
 
08:18:40.208 --> 08:18:40.218 align:start position:0%
support the committee's itl
 
08:18:43.070 --> 08:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you Mr Speaker

thank you Mr Speaker
 
08:20:13.968 --> 08:20:13.978 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that fossil fuel
 
08:20:15.888 --> 08:20:15.898 align:start position:0%
companies produced and promoted
 
08:20:18.230 --> 08:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
disinformation with the intent to delay
 
08:20:20.388 --> 08:20:20.398 align:start position:0%
addressing climate pollution and its

long-term effects
 
08:20:24.888 --> 08:20:24.898 align:start position:0%
and if I know that money talks and other

on part one article 12. reads every
 
08:27:48.590 --> 08:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
every member of the community has a
 
08:27:51.468 --> 08:27:51.478 align:start position:0%
