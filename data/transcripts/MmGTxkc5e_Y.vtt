Mark McConkie.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,500
I chair the committee, Long Range Capital Planning and Utilization Committee.

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,500
I'd like to return from recess from 1007.

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
We have one item before us today.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,500
And with that, I would like to turn to the DOT representative to explain to us disposal of highway turnpike funded real estate.

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,000
This is item LRCP 23022.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please, introduce yourself.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you, Mr.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Chairman.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,500
Members of the committee, I'm Steve Labonte.

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm the administrator of the Bureau of Right-of-Way with the New Hampshire Department of Transportation.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:17,500
We're here today asking for authority to convey a 50-foot wide access easement across three parcels of DOT-owned property, two of which were purchased with highway funds, one of which is rail property.

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:26,000
The reason we're asking for this is that back in the 70s, we had a well-intentioned project.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,500
It was the Franklin Laconia Bypass, which we started acquiring property for at that time.

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:59,500
When we acquired property in this area, we ended up severing access to the parcel owned by JCB, who is the grantee in this case, LLC, we ended up severing access to that parcel back in 1978 when we purchased the property for the corridor for the bypass that I just mentioned.

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:08,000
So when we did that, 20 years passed in the 90s, we still hadn't built the corridor.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:20,500
JCB's predecessor in interest was still using, was still accessing the property what appears to be over a gravel driveway, which passed over the corridor.

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,000
We immortalized that by entering an encroachment agreement with their predecessor and interest.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,500
And what that encroachment agreement said is you can continue to use the gravel driveway.

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:04:04,500
At some point in the future, what we'll do is we'll grant you a permanent access right to the bypass and if after the bypass if well after the town comes through or party comes through and builds the beach road if DOT prefers they can require that the access be removed be moved to the beach the signalized intersection.

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,000
However, that would be on DOT's dime.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:19,500
And that was basically to make the property owner whole who went through the process of building an access point to the bypass.

49
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
So that's why that clause was in here.

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,000
So the access point was never built.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,500
The bypass was never built.

52
00:04:29,500 --> 00:05:01,000
The safest way to access the property is by granting them the proposed access easement, which will then bring them to the beach road and the signalized intersection to Route 3, which is why to basically cure this deficiency, we're asking to be able to grant this easement to JCB for no cost, and we're asking the committee to waive the administrative fee.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm happy to take any further questions.

54
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Questions for Salamate?

55
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Seeing none.

56
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:26,000
Chris, if I could, do we believe that we, if a motion were to come forward to accept this, do we need to also make a motion to waive that fee or just a motion?

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,500
You could have one motion that accepts the easement as well as waives the fee.

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Okay.

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Mr.

60
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Chair, then.

61
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Yes, Representative Mills.

62
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Mr.

63
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:54,000
Chair, I move that we approve LRCP 23022DOT, and further, I move that we request to waive the $1,100 administrative fee.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll second that motion.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you.

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,500
I'll send Mills motion by Mills, seconded by Couillier.

67
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Any discussion?

68
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Seeing none, if you're in favor of the motion, you signify by saying aye.

69
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Aye.

70
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Any opposed?

71
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Motion carries.

72
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Thank you.

73
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,000

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,500

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
