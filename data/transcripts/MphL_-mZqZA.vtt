legislate I'll second representative
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
luno seconds
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
that further discussion from the maker
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill motion yes uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify this uh the reason I
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
think we're trying to move forward with
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
an it on this bill is is very simply
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
that um it's being considered
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary there's nothing in current
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
law that prohibits a student from taking
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
a a day due to a genuine mental health
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
concern uh that's already allowed um
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
this just complicates matters further
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
and would seemingly uh create issues
 
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.230 align:start position:0%
and would seemingly uh create issues
with

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
um missing tests missing other things
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
and not being able to um hold that
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
against the student which or or require
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
them to make it up even which which
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
would be a really big
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
problem thank you represent luno do
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
you okay for those folks this bill just
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
gives an unexcused absence for those
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
that W calling in and saying I have a
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
mental health day I want to take um
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
basically this a local decision local
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
school districts do this in terms of a
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
child being sick and they require that
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
after three days or possibly five days a
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
doctor's certificate a company explain
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%

uh ever driven
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a niche service really um
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
and it is a great
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
alternative um for foster care children
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
um you could have a foster care child

districts great flexibility for foster
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
care kids special needs children um uh

alternative also for we've had lots of
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
discussions um for uh children with IEPs
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
in um charter schools and transportation

um for them back to the home District or
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
for uh someone from the school to the

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.309 align:start position:0%
25996
1896

01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
1896
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
26329 and it really looks like a
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
completely different bill now than the
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
one that was introduced and had a
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
hearing uh I'm not weighing in on the
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
merits of Representative Cornell's
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment here uh on the language but it
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
looks like a completely new bill and um
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering as to whether or
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
not we should get some um some eyes on
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
this represent Luna are you questioning
 
01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:47.079 align:start position:0%
the whether this is a germine am I am
 
01:03:47.079 --> 01:03:48.990 align:start position:0%
the whether this is a germine am I am
will

01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
so okay so yeah thank thank you very
 
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair so so what I'm going to do
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
is I'm going to not go any further with
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
this at this moment we're going to take
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
a break from this particular Bill and
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to seek uh when we do
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
question the germanness of a bill it's
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
got to go forward to the speaker of the
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
house and has to have his making a
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
decision whether it parallels what the
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
bill initially looked like when it was
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
introduced or if there's a significant
 
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
change then it's called non gerain this
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
is not Senate where anything can be
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
added on uh so we will we will leave
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
this bill and we'll go to another bill
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll seek more information on on
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment I appreciate that thank
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
let me take this
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
fine going with the uh Bill we're going
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
to address next is HB 267 criminal
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
background checks is the basic
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh concept uh relative to criminal
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh represent cordelli was going to make
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:35.589 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
going to jump on to another bill then
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
seeing he's not here we're going to go
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
to next one 628 which um accepting funds
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
for performing background checks uh so
 
01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
uh 628 requiring a certain non-public
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
schools or education service providers
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
that accept public funds to perform
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
background checks on all employees and
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
volunteers so represent dry you a motion
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh I move that it' be moved uh itl yes
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
sir a second a second okay
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative dry makes the motion to
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
itl Second by representative penell uh
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
representative dry yes um after a lot of
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
research um there's two sections to this
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
bill one is private schools having to
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
that get EFA money to
 
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
do the background checks um and the
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
other is uh home educated uh students
 
01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
who become EFA students uh the first
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
part is
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
um in the state of New Hampshire private
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
schools have access to all of the um
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
background checks that the public
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
schools do Under the Adam Walsh act the
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
um the administrators of the public
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
school School non-public school uh
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
Association said that all their members
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
are there all the dases schools do back
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
uh background checks in fact every
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
school that I contacted in my district
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
there was a private school did extensive
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
by background checks to the you know the
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
full extent that they could do which
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
includes fingerprints um it's already
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
happening I think it's uh it's a
 
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
redundant bill in that section the part
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
going with home educated uh HFA students
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
it has a lot of questions because it's a
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
a home educated student becomes an an
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
EFA student when they be when they take
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
the EFA funds and even if we're talking
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
about things that are done in their home
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
as their home education study there are
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of out of home projects and
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
curricula that goes on and this opens a
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
large doors to who does the background
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
check who pays for it uh background
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
check has to be done by an agency it can
 
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
be done by an individual uh who gets the
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
results where are they shared and who
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
does anything with them I think it has a
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about it and therefore
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
itl representative Pell do you you made
 
01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.470 align:start position:0%
itl representative Pell do you you made
the

01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.549 align:start position:0%
the
second

01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay any further discussion on itl
 
01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
yes representa
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
Tanner um I'd just like to make a
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
rebuttal a short rebuttal one is that
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
private schools may may do background
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
checks um we don't know if new nonpublic
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
schools or or private schools coming in
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
are doing background checks there's no
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
no real
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
um repository of that um information uh
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
as far as I understand about a third to
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
two3 about a third to a half of the
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
private schools do do background checks
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether they're the same
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks that the
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
do um and if they receive public money
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
through the efas uh through tuition or
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
whatever um I feel that the state has a
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
compelling reason to require them to
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
have the same background criminal
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
background checks which go to a larger
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
extent for public schools um that they
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
should be doing that as far as the
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
homeschool uh issue is concerned um I in
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
my Amendment which um is to exempt uh
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers that are schooled at home
 
01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
and the traditional homeschooling way so
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
um I think everybody I mean we're
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
talking about Transportation just a
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
little bit before and criminal
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
background checks were key to that I
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
think it's key to provide safety for
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
students um just about a week ago there
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
was an article in in-depth New Hampshire
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
about a woman who had been doing
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
volunteer work at a athletic event
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
selling food and and suddenly people
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
realized she was on the um sex offender
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
list um because there were no checks and
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
um I think that that puts Children at
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
Risk so I am going to vote against this
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh against the itl thank you thank
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
you very much representa Tanner
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli um thank you um I I
 
01:10:14.189 --> 01:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
think there are significant problems
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
with um requiring um background checks
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
for Education Service
 
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.030 align:start position:0%
for Education Service
Providers

01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
Providers
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
um um
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
there are Education Service Providers
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
such as as Staples that we've talked
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
about before but uh how about um going
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
to a museum where the CL class is
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
getting instruction possibly um you know
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
could be a courier Museum down in
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester Mcall of Shepard uh
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
Museum um Center um what about EFA
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
students who are coming for a state
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
house tour I see Mount Royal Academy is
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
coming in early December um they have a
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
number of students who receive
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
efas um it's everyone in the State House
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
going to be required to get a new
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
background check in order for these
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
students to um come into the state house
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
and get a tour
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't see any way around that
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
in in this legislation um in addition to
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
um it's a big problem I think uh um you
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
know we've talked about background
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
checks um a lot and we will be talking
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
about them further today
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
um because you get a background check
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
today doesn't mean that um there's not
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a problem uh next week with
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
someone who got that uh background check
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen that in our Public Schools
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen that happen um you know we've
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
seen teachers um in public schools have
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
their licenses revoked because of
 
01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.189 align:start position:0%
their licenses revoked because of
similar

01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
s similar circumstances thank you um so
 
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
I I cannot uh support uh this amendment
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
um or the bill we're not on the
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
amendment right now oh I'm sorry we're
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
on the bill we're on the motion as itl
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay I I'm supporting the itl motion
 
01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the clarification on
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
that represent whitcock thank you
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
chairman lad just a couple questions to
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
follow up on President cordell's
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
comments I would suspect uh that when
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
folks go to the museum or come to the
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
state house uh they're in the under the
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
supervision of a professional teacher
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
who's already had a background check and
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
people in the state house uh giving the
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
tour the teachers accompany them when
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
they go to the museum the car museum the
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
teacher and staff is there so it's
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
really not uh an equal piece and I do
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
take um some uh
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh concern uh to just the end of his
 
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
conversation when he's talking about
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
what happen to public school teachers
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
what happen say it could happen tomorrow
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
I just don't like the way they that was
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
categorized as uh left there and a
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
negative thinking that's all thank you
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair yeah I also
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%

the grounds for non-approval of

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard uh um attorney Fenton from
 
01:14:14.629 --> 01:14:14.639 align:start position:0%

01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%

01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
education which is keeping kids safe and
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
um and with with so much so many changes
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
going on here in New Hampshire with
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
respect to public education and across
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
the state um I think it's it's ever more
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
important that that that the legislature
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
and that the and that that we remain
 
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
Vigilant in making sure that this is job
 
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
one and when when I see you know
 
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
something being handed out from um uh
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
from uh handed out to this committee
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to prenda's background
 
01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
check policy and prenda is a alternative
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
educational setting for um for
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
non-public as well as public students
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
public school students that basically
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
says um uh appena uses Checker a third
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
party company and covers the cost of
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
background checks on these adults
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
through Checker's criminal background
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
check premium service we run and they
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
list them off a County criminal search a
 
01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
federal criminal search a national
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
criminal search a sex offender search an
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
SSN trace and a global watch list search
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
and um and and I think we heard some
 
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that a lot of these searches
 
01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
are basically searches over the Internet
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
for things um they're not
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh background checks
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
conducted by the state police nor
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
conducted by the uh by the F FBI and I
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
think if we're going to be putting our
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
kids um in educational uh uh uh
 
01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
situations where um uh where they're
 
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to be with adults and those adults
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
should be um should
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
be background checked the same way that
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
we background check our um our our
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
adults that our grown-ups that work with
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
our kids in our Public Schools
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
and um and I I I I would certainly you
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
know uh if if if if what Checker is
 
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
doing is somehow equivalent to um to the
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
FBI um uh back criminal history check
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
then uh then you know maybe I'm missing
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
something but uhu but it certainly
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
sounds to me given the the requirement
 
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
that we have legislation that
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
specifically authorizes Criminal FBI
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
criminal history records checks that uh
 
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
that what's being done right now by
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
prena and by others is not sufficient
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
and that um and that the legislature um
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
really needs to act um uh in appropriate
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
way that that's reflective of the
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
changes that are being made in public
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
education today thank you thank you
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
leus I'm not sure how anything has
 
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
changed we've been dealing with this for
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
five years and we were supposed to have
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
a clearing house at the doe for people
 
01:17:31.149 --> 01:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
who are not part of a institution that
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
the FBI will report to how are people
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to get this done if there's no
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
place that the FBI that they are
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
affiliated with it the FBI will do the
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
background check so it's really nice to
 
01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
say let's do it but as far as I can see
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
we still don't have a method for doing
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
it so passing this is not going to make
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
any difference whatsoever we can't can't
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
do it so that was that was number one
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
and number two is the fact that most of
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
these um people who were homeschoolers
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
who are now EFA students parents are
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
there so if the parent is there why do
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
we need a background check on say the
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
music instructor or whatever the parents
 
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
are there so that's it thank you
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
represent vure thank you Mr chair I
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
think I just want to talk about the the
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
biggest thing that I've heard so many
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
times from people I've spoke to about
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and it comes down to it's
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish too much at once
 
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
some of the things that this bill would
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
accomplish are not particularly
 
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
objectionable like private schools doing
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
background checks I mean it's I don't
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
see a big problem with that but then you
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
get down to the minutia some of the
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
other things that it does what happens
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
when you have a couple homeschool
 
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
parents who get together and they decide
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they're going to have a rotating
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
schedule where one teaches this day one
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
teaches the other day now you're
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
requiring a background check for these
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
parents and let's go further with that
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
what if a homeschool parent does have a
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
criminal record uh I mean criminal
 
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
record May disqualify you from being a
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
public school teacher it doesn't
 
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
disqualify you from being a parent so
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen are we going to
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
be in a position where we're telling a
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
parent they can't homeschool their own
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
child because they might have a criminal
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
record I mean it brings up some really
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
weird issues and we need to if we want
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
to do private schools we need to carve
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
that out as a separate bill thank you
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
rson Hall did you have your hand up
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I was just going to uh
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
reference the letter we got from Lori
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
Harman which was powerful enough for me
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
to think wow I mean I don't know if you
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
all remember that letter but uh she went
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
through a lot and so safety better safe
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
than sorry thank you we had just second
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
we had uh this bill went to a
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and you met on September
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
26th and October 18th representative
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
cordelli were any of these issues isues
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
discussed at that
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
time um I I think a number of uh issues
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
were discussed related to uh um uh
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
parents uh related to um non-public
 
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
schools and um educational service
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
providers for EFA
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
students um if I could could I just
 
01:20:20.189 --> 01:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh non-public schools I don't
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
know if anyone talked about non-public
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
schools yet now go ahead thank you um we
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
had a uh a letter from the chair of the
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
non-public school advisory
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
Council um who pointed out that um
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
schools accredited by the New England
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
Association of schools and colleges um
 
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
require um background checks uh
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
non-public school approval by the
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Education requires
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
background checks to be performed he
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
also pointed out uh he is the super
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
attendent of schools for the diois and
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
pointed out that they have every school
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
employee getting a FBI background check
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
through the department of
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
safety um so I think that uh if we're
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
venturing into the area of non-public
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
schools um it's uh stepping out of uh
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
bounds um and it's already being done
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
we've had this discussion for multiple
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
years that it's already being done and
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
um uh there's been no change in that
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
regard and uh I don't see the government
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
mandating something that's already being
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
done in the private
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
sector further discussion yes
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you just
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
to follow by me Mr chair representative
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
bel's comment about the home schools um
 
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
and I agree with them uh Mike in terms
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the parent but I do have significant
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
concern when you're talking about
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
pooling homeschool schoolers that you
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
come over and I teach one week and you
 
01:21:57.149 --> 01:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
teach the other I would surely want to
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
know that the person I'm sending my
 
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
children to uh has been cleared and if
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
they're criminal they can't pass their
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
background check just because they're
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
parent when they're one1 I have no
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
problem with that but when you get into
 
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
group settings like that and you're
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
sending homeschoolers to another set of
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers if I was a parent I'd like
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
to know that where that my youngster
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
going has uh that there is a if there's
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
a problem that has been cleared and been
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
checked that would be my thing but I do
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
understand the one one absolutely you're
 
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
right represent
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman as a 30-year
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
homeschooler I'm going to tell you that
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
we either do it with someone we know or
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
we're there
 
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
watching represent representative
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
Damon I oppose the itl there is nothing
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
more important than protecting
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
children's safety perpetrators don't
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
have a Scarlet Letter or a gold star or
 
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
some visible indicator
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
background you can live next door to
 
01:22:59.709 --> 01:22:59.719 align:start position:0%
someone for decades and find them a
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
pleasant neighbor and think they're a
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable person and that does not tell
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
you what their history is and what they
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
might do we should be passing this bill
 
01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:08.950 align:start position:0%
might do we should be passing this bill
not

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
it further discussion from the committee
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
yes represent cascaden thank you just
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
want to go over some things that we had
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
talked about in the last time that we
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
talked through this bill um because it's
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
getting a little muddy in terms of
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
parents who are doing homeschooling with
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
their children but what I have as a
 
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
summary in the intent of this
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill is that it's to add accountability
 
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
to any non-public school Learning Center
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
or place that assembles children in an
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
organized declared or named educational
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
facility uh who receives education
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts so a parent who's
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
homeschooling this in my interpretation
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
would not affect it but if there's one
 
01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.189 align:start position:0%
would not affect it but if there's one
homeschool

01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
homeschool
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
person that says okay I'll take six kids
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
and I'll educate them for
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
you that I have a problem with
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that's how you're all
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
interpreting this but it's there are
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
Learning Centers I imagine around the
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
state people who have just open up shop
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
um and they need background checks again
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
safety is the big thing
 
01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
here further
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
Miler not to prolong this conversation
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
but uh on the 26th when we did meet
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
differentiation of service provider
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
versus Goods versus
 
01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
services so when we talk about the
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
Staples for example that's a Goods
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
versus a Learning Center which is a
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
service and this is really focused on
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
the service component of it not the
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay is there any further discussion on
 
01:25:02.109 --> 01:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
this bill or on this motion on this bill
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
okay Madam clerk would you please call
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
the bill a motion on it 628 is
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate that's which
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%

it if I me yes go ahead thank you thank
 
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
you um there's two major changes in this
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill one is on line seven where it says
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
an employee or designated volunteer and
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
that that uh designated volunteer is a
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
term that's used in our rsas quite a bit
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
and it means volunteers who come on a
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
regular basis and have individual time
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
with students um that are not supervised
 
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
and the other one is
 
01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.990 align:start position:0%
and the other one is
[Music]

01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
in trying to see it is here um in
 
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.189 align:start position:0%
in trying to see it is here um in
line

01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
31 and it's uh this section shall not
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
pertain to parents giving a non-fa home
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
education program to their
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
children so it's uh the two two biggest
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
um things that people thought were wrong
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
with this bill initially um I can't do
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
anything about uh whether it's
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
government oversight or overreach which
 
01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
is another thing that was brought up
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
consistently um I think it's oversight
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
when it's the safety of children um we
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
know that non-public schools do not have
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
to they are in the statutes it says they
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
may do a background check it's not um
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
put out put forward forward in the RSA
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
how those background checks have to be
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
done um and we know that there are a lot
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
of schools coming online now um that are
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
coming into the state of New Hampshire
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
and as I said as far as I could find out
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
only about uh between a third and a half
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
of the non-public schools do the uh
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
nesque um accreditation and therefore
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
have the background checks the other
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
ones um as far as we know will be doing
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
the background checks as prena so I
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
think this bill is necessary this
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
amendment cleans up the two major uh
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
discrepancies that were brought up and I
 
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
hope you can support the bill further
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative penell yes
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner can you speak to
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
please um This was um put I'm sorry that
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
I didn't uh put that out but uh the
 
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program was one program
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh that's been run in the state of uh
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
the state department and uh dealt with
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
students going out as uh represent
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli said like to um intern or
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
whatever uh in different places about
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
how they actually um dealt with the um
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
background check situation so that was
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
put in here to just uh approach what
 
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
would happen if um a student was
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
interning or going to a separate
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
um service provider I guess would
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
be represent cordelli uh thank you um
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
two questions actually first um on line
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
11 in relation to non-public schools and
 
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
um uh background checks line 11 says uh
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
submission of a history criminal history
 
01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:06.990 align:start position:0%
submission of a history criminal history
background

01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
check who is that to be provided to by a
 
01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:14.950 align:start position:0%
check who is that to be provided to by a
non-public

01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
school is that a question for
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
me well maybe I'll answer both questions
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
and then anyone one who wants the answer
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
at um May the second question is um in
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
relation to the changes on lines 30 and
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
31 that you just mentioned um I believe
 
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
it says a section shall not pertain to a
 
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
parent giving a non-fa student a home
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
education program how about a parent um
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
with an EFA student giving their child a
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
home education it seems like this would
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.390 align:start position:0%
 
person

01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
Damon so in thank you in response to
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's second question
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
line 12 clearly says this shall not
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
apply to parents providing atome school
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
education so the parents who are not
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
part of the EFA program are clearly
 
01:31:17.109 --> 01:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
this so representative McDonald thank
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I think rep Damon just
 
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
noted a discrepancy between line 12 and
 
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
line 31 that the amendment has created
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
which seems to lead to some confusion so
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment appears to be unready at
 
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:38.669 align:start position:0%
the amendment appears to be unready at
this

01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendment not seeing any Madam clerk
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I don't think that we have
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
answered fully the question a home
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
education program becomes an EFA program
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
when the home educating family takes EFA
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
money so they are not no longer
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
considered home education families they
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
are EFA student families so this would
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
not pertain would pertain to those who
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
do not take EFA it would exclude those
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
who do not take EFA money and do home
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
education but they're already
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
excluded this would make a category that
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
has uh home education at home a home
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
education program but they are
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
considered an EFA program because they
 
01:32:38.189 --> 01:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
take EFA money I don't think this is
 
01:32:41.229 --> 01:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
clear the law is very clear if you
 
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
receive the EFA money you are an EFA
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
student if you if you're a home
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
education parent not receiving any money
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
you are a home educator that's one of
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
the four stools for compulsory education
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
but you are correct that there is
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
a conflict here represent beler thank
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and I would just pose the
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
same question I brought up earlier which
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
is if if we're going to be requiring a
 
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
parent to take a background check to
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
educate their own child at home simply
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
because they receive the EFA funding
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
what happens when they if they do have a
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
criminal record is the intent of this
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill and this this would be the question
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
is it to prohibit somebody from with a
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
criminal record from being able to
 
01:33:23.109 --> 01:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
obtain EFA account to educate their own
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
home represent luno thank you very much
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um with with respect to um to
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
EFA students which which section one of
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is directed to uh I think the
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
conflict that you're referring to is one
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
of the one one that's artificially made
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
by proponents of of the EFA program and
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
that uh clearly in section one a
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
distinction is being made that that and
 
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.109 align:start position:0%
distinction is being made that that and
EFA

01:33:53.109 --> 01:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
EFA

student could be attending a non-public
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
school or an EFA
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
student could be um at a could be a
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
homeschool education student with the
 
01:34:07.629 --> 01:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
parents providing those services and in
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
section one this uh criminal background
 
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
check requirement would not apply to
 
01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:14.390 align:start position:0%
check requirement would not apply to
those

01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
parents of um that are that are

providing at school education for their
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
for their student I think that's
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
completely different than what's down at
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the amendment which um uh
 
01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
which says this section shall not
 
01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
pertain to a parent giving a non-fa home
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
education program to their children so
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
that's um that's completely different
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
language and um and applies to u to to
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh completely different
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
students representative cordelli thank
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%

education what if they do receive EFA
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
funding it's doesn't it say that it
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%

01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's University of College and student
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
population is relatively small but it's
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
a liberal Art School a Catholic school
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
and they're they're now um having to be
 
01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
you know where those students go to and
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
where they attend this is what part what
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
the high education commission does and
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
they approve uh and of course and they
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
can have the option to disapprove a
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
univer postsecondary education here this
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
Bill had two parts to it and the first
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
part as you see on the amendment
 
01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.510 align:start position:0%
part as you see on the amendment
committee

01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
members there's on line 15 16 and 17 as
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
a result of our our study and our
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
recommending in in the committee process
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
that the individual the chancellor of
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
the University univers system of New
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire be a member or his or her
 
01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
designate the chancellor of the
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
community college system New Hampshire
 
01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
we've added or
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
design and the commissioner of
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or design and
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Education most
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
likely has a director of higher
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
education that would most likely be the
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
person but it's up to the commissioner
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
to appoint that you can see in lines 21
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
and 22 one member to be appointed by the
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
governor Council as a representative
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
from a for-profit college or university
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
not a member of the UN New Hampshire
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
College University's Council we have
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
none like that in the state right now so
 
01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:32.070 align:start position:0%
none like that in the state right now so
it's

01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
page and we had discussion when the bill
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
was first introduced what kind of uh uh
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
duties the commission can have and this
 
01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
says the commission shall we at one
 
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
Point had the Kish Miss in May but we
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
struck out line four item four there on
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
line 13 apply for accept and expend
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
state federal or state other grants
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
that's been stricken from the bill the
 
01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
the main part of the bill not the main
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
part but the next part of the bill which
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
was dealt with dealt with uh eliminating
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
everything to do with the fiduciary
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
indentification and all that uh of so
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's all gone so we're dealing with
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
just the higher education commission
 
01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
here in this
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and this came as a request
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education as you
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%

no just take that second part out that
 
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:33.880 align:start position:0%

02:07:11.950 --> 02:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
um okay um what we have here is we have
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
a build in in the past we have uh
 
02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
provided support for high schools that
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
are providing uh classes for those that
 
02:07:21.310 --> 02:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
are coming in from homeschooling
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
environment and they get reimbursed a
 
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
0.15 FTE which is you know something we
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
put in effect years ago because kids
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
were going and taking a science class an
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge for class Etc and the school
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
was not getting any reimbursement
 
02:07:39.390 --> 02:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever for that we also had at that
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
same time this is years ago we were
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussing it and we're trying to figure
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
out how can we make this thing work for
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
other grade levels and some were saying
 
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
how can make it work even through the
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
elementary the grade schools and into
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
the junior high Middle School level and
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
high school it was very difficult to
 
02:07:59.790 --> 02:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
deal with the grade school seeing that a
 
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
reading class starts maybe in the
 
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
morning and then sometime in the
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon when that particular group or
 
02:08:07.870 --> 02:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
whatever goes on and you can't Define it
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
as a course uh like you can at the high
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
school level but in looking at since
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
then we know there's a lot of High
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
School courses taught in the Middle
 
02:08:21.149 --> 02:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
School grades in junior high school we
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
also know many junior high schools
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
middle schools have block scheduling and
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's courses so there's no absolutely no
 
02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
reason why we should not be
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursing the middle schools for doing
 
02:08:37.229 --> 02:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
the same task grades seven and eight as
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
we're doing for grades 9 through 12 and
 
02:08:41.549 --> 02:08:41.559 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill basically does it
 
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
allows that to occur so I won't discuss
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
it anymore we're on a short time frame
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
oh you handing it back to me no no
 
02:08:59.790 --> 02:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
I are there further I'll hand it back to
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
Chairman Le and request the opportunity
 
02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
to speak okay represent Tanner then
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli I'm just wondering if
 
02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
this includes CTS do they do they get
 
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
homeschools schoolers coming in and do
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
they get
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursed the the hom School CTE
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
program as represent Cornell knows it's
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
the the the the funding for that is
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
based differently it's based on tuition
 
02:09:29.189 --> 02:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
dollars and it is really a separate
 
02:09:31.629 --> 02:09:31.639 align:start position:0%
different uh category Educational
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
Funding I do not know whether they get
 
02:09:36.549 --> 02:09:36.559 align:start position:0%
that reimburse I know they
 
02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
allow uh homeschoolers to come
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
participate in the CTE programs and and
 
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh they encourage it uh we should uh
 
02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
however I I don't know if there's a
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursement honestly don't have an
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
answer for that one represent
 
02:09:53.069 --> 02:09:53.079 align:start position:0%
Tanner represent
 
02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you excuse me thank
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
you um I think one important part of uh
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
actually the original Bill and this
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
amendment um is that it strikes um a
 
02:10:09.149 --> 02:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
sentence from lines 21 and 22 in the
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
amendment in that the uh payments for
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
these pupils are subject to the
 
02:10:19.069 --> 02:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
availability of Appropriations
 
02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
so if there was money available the
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
school would get reimbursed if there
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't they wouldn't so this makes it
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
clear that it's not dependent upon um
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
available funds the school will get
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for these students which I
 
02:10:38.589 --> 02:10:38.599 align:start position:0%
think is a very important aspect to this
 
02:10:41.470 --> 02:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
bill representative Heath question on
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
that point so what you're saying then is
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
that the education trust um when
 
02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
if in fact the education trust is very
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
healthy right now but if in fact it was
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
Zero at the at that point in time um the
 
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
um education trust would need to draw
 
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
from the general fund in order to do
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
that that's absolutely absolutely that's
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
struck and I think representative Tanner
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
asked a good question and uh you know
 
02:11:16.109 --> 02:11:16.119 align:start position:0%
it's I I I believe that that's something
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we should communicate
 
02:11:19.629 --> 02:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
representative Cornel and I to the
 
02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
advisory Council and pursue that in
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
terms of for a student going to a Career
 
02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:25.350 align:start position:0%
terms of for a student going to a Career
Tech

02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
Tech
 
02:11:27.870 --> 02:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
Center uh because they they're they're
 
02:11:30.750 --> 02:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
being sent by the sending District
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
they're just not able to pick which CTE
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
they want to go to so there there's
 
02:11:37.709 --> 02:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
there's probably an answer in this
 
02:11:40.510 --> 02:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere and we we got to find that
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
out further discussion from the
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%

amendment motion second thank you okay
 
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
discussion yes um when we had 266 come
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
to us from the Senate this year it was a
 
02:15:18.669 --> 02:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
very lengthy Bill and in fact I would
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
estimate at least 25 pages in that bill
 
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
and the bill came to us exactly as
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
introduced and the bill dealt with RSA
 
02:15:35.629 --> 02:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
193e which is adequacy 193c which is
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with Improvement and assessment
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 193 H and
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
K and without any changes and yet there
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
were changes throughout that bill as you
 
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
you all know that when we looked at 266
 
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
and we had the side by sides provided to
 
02:15:56.109 --> 02:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
us there are Mega changes within that
 
02:15:56.119 --> 02:15:57.189 align:start position:0%
us there are Mega changes within that
particular

02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:16:02.109 --> 02:16:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.669 --> 02:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
sb266 and this what uh brings about this
 
02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment is that the the bill we
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
met uh in Committee of whole a number of
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
times trying to address what we can do
 
02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
with two 66 and we've had people coming
 
02:16:25.549 --> 02:16:25.559 align:start position:0%
forth from the Department uh and uh uh
 
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
Katlyn Davis and Dr Nate uh green and
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we shrink that 266 down
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
to several Pages which are uh
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
referencing the needs to parallel what
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
we have in statute with what is required
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
by Essa element every student succeeds
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
act that we have done in this bill the
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
language all comes directly from the
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
Department with the exclusion of Page
 
02:16:58.589 --> 02:16:58.599 align:start position:0%
Three lines 19 through
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
22 during the discussion we had as a
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee the whole there was some
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding when we contract
 
02:17:11.230 --> 02:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
with a testing entity to do the annual
 
02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:12.709 align:start position:0%
with a testing entity to do the annual
Statewide

02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
assessment we have to send information
 
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
to them so that they can send results
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
directly to the
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
parent um this amendment right there
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment contains that along with
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
all the other suggestions that came in
 
02:17:29.709 --> 02:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
from the state and it reads student data
 
02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
shall not be disclosed by the testing
 
02:17:36.509 --> 02:17:36.519 align:start position:0%
entity to any person organization entity
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
or government or any component thereof
 
02:17:41.469 --> 02:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
other than the parent or the guardian
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
the department or the school or school
 
02:17:46.349 --> 02:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
district and shall not be used by the
 
02:17:48.509 --> 02:17:48.519 align:start position:0%
testing entity for any any other purpose
 
02:17:53.070 --> 02:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
except as provided in RSA 193c colon 12
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
law that we have that's the change so
 
02:17:57.790 --> 02:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to protect the da data
 
02:18:00.509 --> 02:18:00.519 align:start position:0%
and and privacy and confidentiality of
 
02:18:03.629 --> 02:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
of of the the student and family
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
information other than that uh there's
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
no changes which differ from um what was
 
02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
presented to us I know that there's all
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks here which may you know
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
have concerns with a lot that was in 26
 
02:18:20.589 --> 02:18:20.599 align:start position:0%
I think this was the Compromise where we
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
could get U language put forward that
 
02:18:25.070 --> 02:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
dealt with Comprehensive support and
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
improvements of schools and dealt with
 
02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
targeted support Improvement for schools
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
so we are paralleling now by doing so uh
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
federal law and
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
Regulation and also uh one of the
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
changes which occurred which uh
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
represent lad's not quite so infatuated
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
with but willing to go along with is
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
that the graduation
 
02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
rate that's spoken to here it used to be
 
02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
that uh when we had a rate this dropped
 
02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:56.709 align:start position:0%
that uh when we had a rate this dropped
below

02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
below
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
69% uh two consecutive years then a
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
school received support comprehensive
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
support uh it's now been dropped down to
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
67% for one year and that parallels what
 
02:19:13.950 --> 02:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
we have in Federal Regulation so that
 
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
was done I personally would like to see
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh the credit graduation rate reflect
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
what our state is actually accomplishing
 
02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
an average graduation rate of around 92
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
plus% which is a good reflection on our
 
02:19:30.910 --> 02:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
state and there's a lot of uh conditions
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
which go into graduation rates as you
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
know some kids graduate in six years
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
others four years um some transfer out
 
02:19:41.190 --> 02:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
graduate somewhere else some get the the
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
not the GED but the highet uh so there's
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues associated with that but
 
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
I think that this as it is right now is
 
02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:51.910 align:start position:0%
I think that this as it is right now is
is

02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
a part of law that we really need to
 
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
parallel what we're what we're being
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
required to do so by the federal
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
government and allows us to give the
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
support to those uh that are receiving
 
02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
funding for from
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
Essa that's
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
it representative mil yeah Ju Just a
 
02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
technical question here um this bill
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
Essa so when another
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
Ed when another Administration comes in
 
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
and creates a program like every Child
 
02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:25.670 align:start position:0%
and creates a program like every Child
Left

02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
Left
 
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
Behind I'm my ref the question is is the
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
reference to this specific federal
 
02:20:36.190 --> 02:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
law in relationship to when this Law
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
changes with another legislation another
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
Administration what happens with this
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
language then when you specifically are
 
02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
citing a particular law I don't know the
 
02:20:48.429 --> 02:20:48.439 align:start position:0%
answer to that I'm just raising the
 
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
question about whether the
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of trying to
 
02:20:55.309 --> 02:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
specifically cite a law rather than
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
federal regulations for example which
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
goes any you know I I I if you're that
 
02:21:04.990 --> 02:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
maybe I tried to answer that for you um
 
02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
I know that when we're we're looking at
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
Essa right now but if you look on page
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
four at the top of the page there how
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
the elementary and secondary Education
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
Act of 1964 5
 
02:21:22.590 --> 02:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
Esa um and it's it's it's gone through
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
many revisions and changes obviously but
 
02:21:27.469 --> 02:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
we're still talking about the esa you
 
02:21:31.870 --> 02:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
know act so I I I've talked about that
 
02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
with u with uh with Nate before and he's
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
always come back and saying this is in
 
02:21:40.510 --> 02:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
if you look at other areas of Statute as
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
well we always reference as amended the
 
02:21:47.230 --> 02:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
esa as amended so I I think we're
 
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
my yes yeah thanks thanks very much um I
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh comment on on page two um Roman 2 at
 
02:22:08.190 --> 02:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
the top lines 5 through 7 um we're
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
adding a new a new paragraph that um
 
02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
allows a um School District may choose
 
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
to participate in a local developed
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
alternative assessment program I'm I'm
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
trying to see how that
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
works where it where where where that
 
02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
where Roman 2 continues as long as such
 
02:22:32.910 --> 02:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
program or if such program is offered by
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
the department and approved by the
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
United States Department of Education
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
how is that look I'd be glad to respond
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
to that what this this language does it
 
02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
really tightens it up for the Department
 
02:22:47.389 --> 02:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
it used to be language and if you go go
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
back and look at this particular section
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
only it wasn't in the section two it was
 
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
they bounced sections around a little
 
02:22:57.630 --> 02:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
bit that a local school district could
 
02:23:01.710 --> 02:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
offer a different a Statewide assessment
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
and all they had to do in consultation
 
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
with the Department that's the way it
 
02:23:09.389 --> 02:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
read the department has said that's not
 
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's in conflict with Essa and it's
 
02:23:14.670 --> 02:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
caused a problem and we that came about
 
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
remember we had the old PACE program
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
and that we got a waiver for we got a
 
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
specific waiver for Pace but then we
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
also had if a school district has a
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment let's say they're
 
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
using the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and
 
02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
they don't want to use the Statewide
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
assessment they could go ahead and use a
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
test if it measured those Statewide
 
02:23:41.710 --> 02:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
standards or needs and they could do it
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
and without with only consultation with
 
02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
it they didn't have to have approval
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
this now says right here a school
 
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
district may choose to participate in a
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
locally developed alternative assessment
 
02:23:54.429 --> 02:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
in place of the statewise if such
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
program is offered by the department and
 
02:23:58.830 --> 02:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the United States Department
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
of Education so they're going to have
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's tightening this thing up
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
and it's taking that flexibility of the
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
local if they want to go that direction
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
and requiring them to get it it if the
 
02:24:13.469 --> 02:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
state department and the state has
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
approved through a number of Grants

demonstrate it provides the opportunity
 
02:25:57.389 --> 02:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education it goes on for
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
a long period of time about what happens
 
02:26:04.429 --> 02:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
if that after a second consecutive year
 
02:26:07.269 --> 02:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
and after a third consecutive year so
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's the process related to CSI it is y
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay and may I represent lad and that's

nothing new uh represent Heath you are a
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Department I'm sure you
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
well further
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
questions so I so just because this is a
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
very technical thing um so just
 
02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
reflecting over to representative Heath
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's a reasonable um statutory
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
reference for a for a school that's been
 
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
found to be a CSI these steps have been
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
in place for a number of years um
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
actually before Esser even um probably
 
02:26:53.230 --> 02:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
adjusted somewhat but it's it's
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable steps for school Improvement
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
basically okay I wish we had some money
 
02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:00.040 align:start position:0%

02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
stream change the
 
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
do then we'll have to do it here because
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
probably doable but I just want to make
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
sure that's accounted for well see yeah
 
02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
I know it but
 
02:30:51.469 --> 02:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
uh he for everybody here we're probably
 
02:30:53.469 --> 02:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
going to have to do the 12:30 meeting
 
02:30:56.110 --> 02:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
here because it's got to be streamed
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so we'll do it that way can I
 
02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
get these things done for that um this
 
02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:05.960 align:start position:0%

HB 354 ought to
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second
 
03:44:20.960 --> 03:44:23.830 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second
second

03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:44:26.429 --> 03:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
okay for a number of years New Hampshire
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools have been
 
03:44:30.910 --> 03:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
disadvantage in maintaining facilities
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
the passage of the bill would level the
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
playing field by allowing charter
 
03:44:37.189 --> 03:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
schools to apply for state school
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
building Aid I'd also like to remind the
 
03:44:42.030 --> 03:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
commit that enabling the application
 
03:44:44.110 --> 03:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
process does not ensure building
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
projects will be funded but instead
 
03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
creates a fair process for charter
 
03:44:51.070 --> 03:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
schools and schools of the traditional
 
03:44:53.389 --> 03:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
model this is an important step forward
 
03:44:55.269 --> 03:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
especially considering that charter
 
03:45:01.229 --> 03:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
you okay uh who did the second on that
 
03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:06.990 align:start position:0%
you okay uh who did the second on that
represent

03:45:06.990 --> 03:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:45:11.670 --> 03:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli nothing further okay
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
I'd like to introduce amendment 2 354
 
03:45:16.990 --> 03:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
and I hope I got the right one in front
 
03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:18.309 align:start position:0%
and I hope I got the right one in front
of

03:45:18.309 --> 03:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
me I'm just got so many amendments here
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
I've got
 
03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh5 okay that's the one I've got uh I'd
 
03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
like to introduce uh
 
03:45:37.149 --> 03:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.670 --> 03:45:40.680 align:start position:0%

second
 
03:45:45.630 --> 03:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh I'd like to go ahead and
 
03:45:50.469 --> 03:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
speak to this um we this is a bill 354
 
03:45:53.710 --> 03:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
we had 1 two 3 four
 
03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
five committee as a whole during the
 
03:45:58.389 --> 03:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
course of the last several months in
 
03:46:00.630 --> 03:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
fact we had one back in
 
03:46:03.870 --> 03:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
June and we're looking at the need for
 
03:46:07.510 --> 03:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools which are public
 
03:46:11.790 --> 03:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
schools to have the opportunity to apply
 
03:46:15.510 --> 03:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
for uh Aid to construct or renovate a
 
03:46:18.110 --> 03:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
building we also know that already on
 
03:46:22.149 --> 03:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
the books we have a lease uh program for
 
03:46:24.070 --> 03:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
them where they can receive funds for
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
their lease and I believe the lease it
 
03:46:30.189 --> 03:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
can be up to as much as $50,000 am I
 
03:46:34.110 --> 03:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
correct representa Heath thank you and
 
03:46:35.910 --> 03:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
so we do have nothing though on the
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
books for the buildings which are owned
 
03:46:43.590 --> 03:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
by the charter school and this bill
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
tries to address that seeing that we do
 
03:46:48.389 --> 03:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
have some in fact we have some schools
 
03:46:50.790 --> 03:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
which vary in size from maybe several
 
03:46:54.149 --> 03:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
grades and in a small building to those
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
which are 500 more students in the high
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
school level and so there they there are
 
03:47:03.389 --> 03:47:03.399 align:start position:0%
needs to try to make sure that our
 
03:47:05.309 --> 03:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
public school students are in buildings
 
03:47:07.950 --> 03:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
which meet all these codes fire Life
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
Safety health um have the opportunity to
 
03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
acquire uh the areas of their education
 
03:47:17.710 --> 03:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
their learning experience in a way that
 
03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be um preparing them for the
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
future so the amendment which we have in
 
03:47:27.189 --> 03:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
front of you at one point in time we
 
03:47:30.189 --> 03:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
were looking at what happens if the
 
03:47:33.149 --> 03:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
school dissolves what happens if they go
 
03:47:35.590 --> 03:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
away for a voluntary or an involuntary
 
03:47:38.550 --> 03:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
reason it doesn't really matter which
 
03:47:41.790 --> 03:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
and they have taken money from school
 
03:47:45.149 --> 03:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
building Aid uh funding through the
 
03:47:48.269 --> 03:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
state as we have in law for other areas
 
03:47:52.149 --> 03:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
of school building Aid any public school
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
that is closed within that 20-year
 
03:47:57.790 --> 03:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
period has to repay back the monies
 
03:47:59.790 --> 03:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
which have been forwarded to them for
 
03:48:01.630 --> 03:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
their state for the construction or
 
03:48:03.790 --> 03:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
renovation of that building unless
 
03:48:06.149 --> 03:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
there's an extenuating
 
03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
Circumstance the way this bill is
 
03:48:10.269 --> 03:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
written right now in this am amendment
 
03:48:13.469 --> 03:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
is that the the charter school will not
 
03:48:16.389 --> 03:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
be receiving monies as a regular public
 
03:48:20.189 --> 03:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
school does where they get 80% up front
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
and the other 20% of the state share
 
03:48:26.189 --> 03:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
upon completion of the project the way
 
03:48:28.349 --> 03:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
it works with this is that they will
 
03:48:32.590 --> 03:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
receive 30% of the costs of the of the
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
construction but that 30% will be spread
 
03:48:38.349 --> 03:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
over 20 years so they'll getting
 
03:48:40.750 --> 03:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
incrementally each year X number of
 
03:48:42.189 --> 03:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
dollars depending upon how much the
 
03:48:43.750 --> 03:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
state share might have been it might
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
have been a million dollar may have been
 
03:48:46.990 --> 03:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
a million and a half may have been two
 
03:48:48.429 --> 03:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
and then of course then you can figure
 
03:48:50.910 --> 03:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
that out by saying of that then that to
 
03:48:53.590 --> 03:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
being 30% of the total cost of
 
03:48:55.830 --> 03:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
construction it be spread over that 20e
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
period of
 
03:49:02.349 --> 03:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
time so the amendment speaks to all this
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
and allows and and uses basically the
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
same language which is in law for other
 
03:49:12.590 --> 03:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
public schools in terms of the criteria
 
03:49:14.510 --> 03:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
they have to meet when they're
 
03:49:16.990 --> 03:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
building uh they have to build of course
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
a code based the
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
standards um and then we've also added
 
03:49:24.030 --> 03:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
amendment what happens if a charter
 
03:49:29.790 --> 03:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
school does dissolve and we have on page
 
03:49:31.229 --> 03:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
five where it says Provisions for
 
03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
dissolution of the Charter Public School
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
including disposition of assets or
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
amendment of its program plan that's
 
03:49:39.790 --> 03:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
that's in place already but we we add in
 
03:49:41.469 --> 03:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
there a Charter Public School may not be
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
eligible for a State Building aid grant
 
03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
until the State Board of Education has
 
03:49:48.189 --> 03:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
approved the school at schools asset
 
03:49:51.269 --> 03:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
disposition plan what will happen in
 
03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
case they do be due to voluntary
 
03:49:58.269 --> 03:49:58.279 align:start position:0%
involuntary dissolution um close shop so
 
03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
that is the nature of this it we think
 
03:50:03.469 --> 03:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
it's only fair that that the Charter
 
03:50:07.030 --> 03:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
School uh students have the opportunity
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
to attend a school which is you know
 
03:50:12.429 --> 03:50:12.439 align:start position:0%
it's a state school it's state funded uh
 
03:50:14.469 --> 03:50:14.479 align:start position:0%
that it also now meets all the standards
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
and conditions of the state so I'm
 
03:50:20.030 --> 03:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
hoping that we will look at this lightly
 
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
and and and approvingly and and send the
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
right motion to the house floor thank
 
03:50:28.830 --> 03:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
you um if if I could just ask you a
 
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
question of the representative um you
 
03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:32.110 align:start position:0%
question of the representative um you
mentioned

03:50:32.110 --> 03:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:50:34.469 --> 03:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
30% um of the cost of construction
 
03:50:37.030 --> 03:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's current law isn't it is it not
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
yes yes that is current that is current
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
law but the the the issue we have to
 
03:50:44.349 --> 03:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
remember is that there's conflicting
 
03:50:47.349 --> 03:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
laws in the statutes right now one place
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
you can receive the other place says no
 
03:50:49.439 --> 03:50:50.149 align:start position:0%
you can receive the other place says no
you

03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
cannot and so with that conflict this
 
03:50:55.389 --> 03:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
bill eliminates that Conflict by
 
03:50:58.630 --> 03:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
repealing on page
 
03:51:01.110 --> 03:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
five relative to the prohibition on
 
03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Schools receiving School
 
03:51:05.670 --> 03:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
building a that is repealed so they
 
03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
become eligible and they have to jump
 
03:51:09.550 --> 03:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
through those same Hoops that everybody
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
else has to jump to and when you talk
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
about the total amount of funding that
 
03:51:13.920 --> 03:51:14.990 align:start position:0%
about the total amount of funding that
we

03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
provide you're could be looking at what
 
03:51:18.630 --> 03:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
charter schools are going to receive
 
03:51:20.710 --> 03:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's just a minuscule amount of the
 
03:51:22.510 --> 03:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School funding that's
 
03:51:24.910 --> 03:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the state hopefully
 
03:51:27.149 --> 03:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can really up the Annie in
 
03:51:28.750 --> 03:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
terms of what we are providing for
 
03:51:31.229 --> 03:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
Charter Public for all public schools
 
03:51:32.790 --> 03:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
because I understand and we've been
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
pushing for years that no less than $50
 
03:51:40.149 --> 03:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
million be approved annually and as we
 
03:51:42.510 --> 03:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
move away and pay off that tail that
 
03:51:44.910 --> 03:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
debt which we have incurred we will have
 
03:51:47.469 --> 03:51:47.479 align:start position:0%
more money for building Aid and of
 
03:51:49.389 --> 03:51:49.399 align:start position:0%
course we got stacked up behind us a
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
number of school projects including
 
03:51:54.070 --> 03:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
charter schools that need our support so
 
03:51:56.990 --> 03:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
I hope we can move forward with
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
this uh represent
 
03:52:03.269 --> 03:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman cordelli um
 
03:52:07.149 --> 03:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
Rick just this lad huh representative
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
lad right there next to represent
 
03:52:12.429 --> 03:52:12.439 align:start position:0%
yeah but we're supposed to be using our
 
03:52:14.189 --> 03:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
terminology here the representative from
 
03:52:15.990 --> 03:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
hail New
 
03:52:18.990 --> 03:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Rick I'm looking at the page
 
03:52:23.389 --> 03:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
two 11 to 15 you're talking about uh I I
 
03:52:24.830 --> 03:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
I just want try to be high time trying
 
03:52:28.389 --> 03:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
to understand it if it says in line
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
13 that the annual Grant is shall be 5%
 
03:52:35.229 --> 03:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
each year for 20 but then on line 15 it
 
03:52:37.830 --> 03:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
says no more than 10% shall be
 
03:52:39.389 --> 03:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
distributed until the complete
 
03:52:41.590 --> 03:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
verification of the final cost so does
 
03:52:43.950 --> 03:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
that mean that the payment
 
03:52:46.229 --> 03:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
stops after the second year because
 
03:52:48.429 --> 03:52:48.439 align:start position:0%
you'll be at 10% and then it picks back
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
up again I'm just confus I probably
 
03:52:51.990 --> 03:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
reading it
 
03:52:55.229 --> 03:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
wrong see what I mean yeah this this was
 
03:52:58.189 --> 03:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
in the original bill as proposed um
 
03:52:59.870 --> 03:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's okay if I'm
 
03:53:01.870 --> 03:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
confused well that's okay you come from
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
Conway yes
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
sir okay um but originally from havil go
 
03:53:12.550 --> 03:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.630 --> 03:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
it so answer the I miss missed this me
 
03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:53:22.189 --> 03:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
this if it's not done years you don't
 
03:53:23.389 --> 03:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
get any
 
03:53:25.910 --> 03:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
payments you get five get five a year
 
03:53:27.750 --> 03:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
but 15 it says you can't get more than
 
03:53:30.750 --> 03:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
10 till it's done not until it's
 
03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
verified take two years so the
 
03:53:34.469 --> 03:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
completion of the
 
03:53:36.550 --> 03:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
construction line 16 says the completion
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
of construction if it takes more than
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
two years what happen
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's I'm saying you stop at 10 a
 
03:53:44.830 --> 03:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
threee project we don't get it until
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's complete so you don't get five
 
03:53:51.070 --> 03:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
year how long the project is well it
 
03:53:52.510 --> 03:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
takes three years you only get 10% you
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
have to wait the first part says five
 
03:53:56.950 --> 03:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
year for 20 years that's I'm just I'm
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
just confused that's
 
03:54:04.349 --> 03:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
live I'm not going to comment on that
 
03:54:09.540 --> 03:54:09.550 align:start position:0%
one right there because you know
 
03:54:09.550 --> 03:54:12.910 align:start position:0%
one right there because you know
[Music]

03:54:12.910 --> 03:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:15.670 --> 03:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
that we have a representative here that
 
03:54:17.590 --> 03:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
submitted this bill may we could ask the
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor that you're so inclined
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
represent whitcock I'm
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
just I don't think an some clarity
 
03:54:26.750 --> 03:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter who answers it
 
03:54:28.510 --> 03:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative money do you have any
 
03:54:32.910 --> 03:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.510 --> 03:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
one being the she is the prime sponsor
 
03:54:37.110 --> 03:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you chairman lad thank you
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I know you've
 
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
spent ample time on this bill and I
 
03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate your remarks prior to the
 
03:54:46.269 --> 03:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
executive session for the record my name
 
03:54:48.870 --> 03:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
is representative Morin money I did
 
03:54:52.269 --> 03:54:52.279 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor House Bill 354 I did Prime
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor the amendment which was the
 
03:54:56.830 --> 03:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
exact language of 354 which was attached
 
03:55:00.030 --> 03:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
to the house version of the budget pass
 
03:55:02.510 --> 03:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
the house was taken out in the Senate
 
03:55:04.269 --> 03:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
and as a side note I was also the prime
 
03:55:06.149 --> 03:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor to raise the lease eight amount
 
03:55:07.990 --> 03:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
to 50,000 so I appreciate that for
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools with that introduction I
 
03:55:12.189 --> 03:55:12.199 align:start position:0%
don't have the bill in front of me so I
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
apologize for that if you could repeat
 
03:55:18.670 --> 03:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
answer at one
 
03:55:24.550 --> 03:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
point one
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
talks it's uh the point in question is
 
03:55:32.990 --> 03:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
um on page two yes page two uh lines um
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
basically 12 through
 
03:55:37.950 --> 03:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
17 we just trying to discern the
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
difference it says 5% a year for 20 I
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
got that then you move down a couple
 
03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
lines further and it says until but only
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
no more than 10% until the completion of
 
03:55:49.269 --> 03:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
the project so if it's a three-year
 
03:55:51.030 --> 03:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
building project does that mean they
 
03:55:53.189 --> 03:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
stop and then stop at the start again
 
03:55:55.870 --> 03:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
because that would take four years you
 
03:55:58.389 --> 03:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
don't that's the question I'm
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
just I believe that is a correct
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
interpretation and I will say this
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
section was
 
03:56:05.399 --> 03:56:07.070 align:start position:0%
section was
specifically

03:56:07.070 --> 03:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:56:09.309 --> 03:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
requested and suggested
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
by the Department of
 
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
Education so their managing of it would
 
03:56:20.750 --> 03:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.110 --> 03:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
language okay follow thank you so
 
03:56:28.750 --> 03:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
basically then it it's it's kind of
 
03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
contrary I mean it just starts and stops
 
03:56:33.229 --> 03:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
in the regular school bilding aid that
 
03:56:34.990 --> 03:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't occur is that
 
03:56:37.790 --> 03:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
correct if you're asking me I it was
 
03:56:39.189 --> 03:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
that's where the question
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
um if you look at regular public school
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
aid right where 80% comes to you the
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
other 20% doesn't come until completion
 
03:56:54.189 --> 03:56:54.199 align:start position:0%
has been approved not just completion as
 
03:56:56.269 --> 03:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
you see it but it has to be approved by
 
03:56:59.149 --> 03:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
Amy Clark I'm looking at this right here
 
03:57:00.630 --> 03:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
where it says not more than 10% of the
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
eligible amount shall be dispersed until
 
03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
the completion of the construction right
 
03:57:08.990 --> 03:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
so they're trying to get a h handle on
 
03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
we are not going to disperse anything
 
03:57:13.710 --> 03:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
until we have at you know that
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
completion approved then you can get you
 
03:57:18.510 --> 03:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
know you can't get any more than 10%
 
03:57:20.830 --> 03:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
beforehand uh but at that point you
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
can't get any more until you show it
 
03:57:22.439 --> 03:57:24.429 align:start position:0%
can't get any more until you show it
it's

03:57:24.429 --> 03:57:24.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:57:30.030 --> 03:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:33.269 --> 03:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
questions repres represent luno thanks
 
03:57:36.670 --> 03:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair um and so uh question
 
03:57:38.990 --> 03:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
goes to um what representative l was
 
03:57:41.429 --> 03:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
talking about with respect to the
 
03:57:43.550 --> 03:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
disposition of Chartered Public School
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
Assets in the event of dissolution and I
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
was wondering what are the um uh what
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
are the minimum requirements for the
 
03:57:54.030 --> 03:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
disposition of those assets that are um
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:03.070 --> 03:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
354 is that for me yeah let me well I
 
03:58:06.550 --> 03:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
put it out there for yeah and I I'll try
 
03:58:09.429 --> 03:58:09.439 align:start position:0%
to respond to that because every school
 
03:58:11.149 --> 03:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
bit district is going to be every chart
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be somewhat different and
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
and when you set up these agreements and
 
03:58:18.750 --> 03:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
you accept these dis disposition
 
03:58:20.670 --> 03:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
agreements they are going to be
 
03:58:22.349 --> 03:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
different based upon a lot of different
 
03:58:25.630 --> 03:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
factors dealing with uh resources that
 
03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
are available to them size of school and
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
on it goes local so rather than write
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
down specific criteria here um um to
 
03:58:39.070 --> 03:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools since um
 
03:58:41.189 --> 03:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh since the local taxpayer would be
 
03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying back the state in
 
03:58:45.510 --> 03:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
the event a public school facility is no
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
longer used what is the um what is the
 
03:58:52.670 --> 03:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
the the the similar thing uh uh for
 
03:58:55.710 --> 03:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
charter schools that would require the
 
03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
the charters um board to repay back the
 
03:59:04.149 --> 03:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
state in the event the um the charter
 
03:59:06.389 --> 03:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
were to dissolve and I believe we did
 
03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
hear that in the
 
03:59:11.309 --> 03:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
what is it two decades we've had charter
 
03:59:13.870 --> 03:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
schools here in New Hampshire that a
 
03:59:17.189 --> 03:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
handful of them have have dissolved so
 
03:59:19.670 --> 03:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
we know for a fact that that history has
 
03:59:22.830 --> 03:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
told us that Charter Schools do in fact
 
03:59:25.349 --> 03:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh dissolve not aware of any public
 
03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
schools that have um have have dissolved
 
03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
but um um but I'm just wondering you
 
03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
know what is that what is that
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
requirement where's that laid out for
 
03:59:38.229 --> 03:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
Charter since we do have it in place for
 
03:59:40.990 --> 03:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
public public school right um if I could
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
respond um uh I I think we also heard
 
03:59:47.429 --> 03:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
that uh with those um charter schools
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
that have uh dissolved uh there has not
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
been a problem with um any of those uh
 
03:59:58.110 --> 03:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
schools um and the uh Return of the
 
04:00:01.630 --> 04:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
assets um and in this legislation on
 
04:00:03.429 --> 04:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
page five it says in order to be
 
04:00:06.510 --> 04:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
eligible for the aid the disposition
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
plan has to be updated
 
04:00:11.670 --> 04:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh to accommodate uh the school building
 
04:00:14.149 --> 04:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
Aid so the
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
disposition um plan must be updated in
 
04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
order to qualify for Aid um and I um did
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
talk to um the
 
04:00:28.110 --> 04:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh deputy director of the charitable
 
04:00:31.469 --> 04:00:31.479 align:start position:0%
trust unit of the Department of Justice
 
04:00:34.590 --> 04:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
who uh I talked to him should um it be
 
04:00:36.070 --> 04:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
doe um statutes
 
04:00:42.990 --> 04:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
or in the doj because um any charter
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
school has to file with charitable trust
 
04:00:45.840 --> 04:00:47.110 align:start position:0%
school has to file with charitable trust
as

04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:00:49.790 --> 04:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and as part of their articles
 
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
agreement they must also have a
 
04:00:54.950 --> 04:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
disposition plan in their articles of
 
04:00:59.670 --> 04:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
agreement and he did not think that
 
04:01:02.349 --> 04:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
um um the section that we were looking
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
at in the doj statutes would be
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate he thought that uh it would
 
04:01:10.750 --> 04:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate um in in these areas
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
so so where follow up to go ahead to you
 
04:01:17.910 --> 04:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
um um representative cordelli where in
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
354 this goes back to my original
 
04:01:23.469 --> 04:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
question um where does it lay out what
 
04:01:24.990 --> 04:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
those minimum standard minimum
 
04:01:27.229 --> 04:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
requirements are for disposition of
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
assets um uh following a a charter
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
dissolution I understand that the that
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
doj requires that of all non not
 
04:01:39.550 --> 04:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
for-profit uh entities uh registered in
 
04:01:42.189 --> 04:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
the state but um and that while you say
 
04:01:43.469 --> 04:01:43.479 align:start position:0%
there's never been a problem with
 
04:01:45.429 --> 04:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
charters in the past we've never had
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
building Aid we've never had State
 
04:01:52.429 --> 04:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money going to uh to to fund
 
04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
assets uh of a um of a charter this
 
04:01:59.309 --> 04:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
would be the first time with that and in
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
fact we have seen what at least one
 
04:02:05.149 --> 04:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
charter dissolved because of financial
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
mismanagement um substantial Financial
 
04:02:07.560 --> 04:02:08.790 align:start position:0%
mismanagement um substantial Financial
mismanagement

04:02:08.790 --> 04:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
mismanagement
 
04:02:10.750 --> 04:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
so so there have been problems with
 
04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools there have been problems
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
with with um with dissolution and how is
 
04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
the state going to be protected from
 
04:02:20.910 --> 04:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
ending up holding the bag State's
 
04:02:22.750 --> 04:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
protected for public schools how's it
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to be protected in this case the
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
the uh charter school has to annually
 
04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
with the charitable trust report their
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
audit and their audit includes their all
 
04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
their assets and it can be anywhere from
 
04:02:38.910 --> 04:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
books supplies motor
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
Vehicles Furnishings equipment
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
facilities property and those are those
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
assets as in any audit when you're
 
04:02:50.110 --> 04:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
listing your expenses your revenues and
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
your your assets is an annual Affair and
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
so with that those are the portions the
 
04:03:02.429 --> 04:03:02.439 align:start position:0%
elements which can that contribute to
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
that disposition plan that we are
 
04:03:06.830 --> 04:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
requiring that they
 
04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
have and it's going to be different for
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
each particular charter school but uh it
 
04:03:15.550 --> 04:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
it it's I think it's pretty clear that
 
04:03:17.710 --> 04:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
that there going to have to Pro pay back
 
04:03:20.910 --> 04:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
only that portion of the school building
 
04:03:23.110 --> 04:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
Aid that they have received we're not
 
04:03:25.510 --> 04:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
looking at getting a chunk out of you
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
know their return value for property or
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
facilities or Tex or
 
04:03:32.189 --> 04:03:32.199 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh we're looking for
 
04:03:35.229 --> 04:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of only the state aid that
 
04:03:38.590 --> 04:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
they have received and if it's in
 
04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
many of these Charter Schools not many I
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
I won't say that I'll say those that
 
04:03:46.189 --> 04:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
have not that aren't here that have
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
dissolved how many years did it take
 
04:03:49.950 --> 04:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
well you know after three or four or
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
five years well after three or four or
 
04:03:55.269 --> 04:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
five years of receiving this amount of
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
money which they're receiving I I figure
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
it's pretty minimal in terms of if
 
04:04:02.550 --> 04:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
you're talking only 30% of the the cost
 
04:04:04.750 --> 04:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
of the project and then you're looking
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
at 5% over those years going out you're
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
not looking at significant dollars and I
 
04:04:12.590 --> 04:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
believe that the other property value
 
04:04:13.990 --> 04:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
and all that other assets would
 
04:04:16.030 --> 04:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
certainly cover it so so where does it
 
04:04:18.070 --> 04:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
say in here that those that those
 
04:04:20.670 --> 04:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer monies would get paid back to
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
the state not looking for more than that
 
04:04:25.149 --> 04:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
but where does it say in here that that
 
04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
that would happen it would be within
 
04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
that disposition
 
04:04:33.030 --> 04:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
plan or not it doesn't say that the
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.960 --> 04:04:41.870 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:04:41.870 --> 04:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
certainly not required by the
 
04:04:47.950 --> 04:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
doj if I could read from the uh
 
04:04:50.189 --> 04:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
testimony that we receive from the
 
04:04:50.199 --> 04:04:51.550 align:start position:0%
testimony that we receive from the
charitable

04:04:51.550 --> 04:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
04:04:51.560 --> 04:04:54.910 align:start position:0%
charitable
trust

04:04:54.910 --> 04:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
um the dissolution clause in the
 
04:04:59.149 --> 04:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
Articles of agreement must provide that
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
upon dissolution the organization will
 
04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
distribute its assets to another
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or government
 
04:05:06.880 --> 04:05:12.189 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or government
entity

04:05:12.189 --> 04:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.199 --> 04:05:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't represent Woodcock then
 
04:05:20.149 --> 04:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
represent Heath thank you chairman Le
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
represent C I like to go back if I may
 
04:05:25.389 --> 04:05:25.399 align:start position:0%
go back to the the uh lines two three
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
and four and page five he intimated that
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
when you said when you spoke about that
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
explaining that part of of the uh change
 
04:05:34.189 --> 04:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that that would they to
 
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
go back and and file a new asset
 
04:05:39.110 --> 04:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
distribution plan but it was my
 
04:05:40.710 --> 04:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that the initial asset
 
04:05:43.309 --> 04:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
asset distribution plan was filed with
 
04:05:46.269 --> 04:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
doe when the sh of school applied and
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say anything about A
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
Renewed disis plan I me they when they
 
04:05:53.790 --> 04:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
file that their the 5164 638 and when
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
the doe approved the charter they approv
 
04:05:58.990 --> 04:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
the initial distribution plan and that's
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
all this is and and unless I
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstood I thought you said in the
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
updated one I don't see nothing here
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
that says that the updated included the
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:13.830 --> 04:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
if I might um on those lines it says in
 
04:06:16.750 --> 04:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
order to qualify for the building Aid
 
04:06:20.550 --> 04:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
yeah they have to um show the asset
 
04:06:20.560 --> 04:06:22.149 align:start position:0%
yeah they have to um show the asset
disposition

04:06:22.149 --> 04:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
disposition
 
04:06:24.510 --> 04:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
plan doesn't say upgrade it doesn't say
 
04:06:27.389 --> 04:06:27.399 align:start position:0%
update doesn't say new
 
04:06:29.790 --> 04:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that the department can
 
04:06:32.070 --> 04:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
look at the current disposition plan
 
04:06:35.389 --> 04:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
anytime they want but in order to and
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's available to the public um but in
 
04:06:40.469 --> 04:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
order to qualify for the building Aid it
 
04:06:44.830 --> 04:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
has to reflect the uh the new situation
 
04:06:47.229 --> 04:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
um in the disposition plan doesn't say
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
that I it it does to me it doesn't say
 
04:06:52.149 --> 04:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
new I see I don't see new there it says
 
04:06:54.429 --> 04:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
or amendment of its program
 
04:06:56.990 --> 04:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
plan on three two three and four the
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
change doesn't say new it's the same
 
04:07:02.189 --> 04:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
it's the same almost the same lines that
 
04:07:04.110 --> 04:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
does in the initial Charter School
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
approval that you have to have the plan
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's all just
 
04:07:09.870 --> 04:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're saying yeah but it
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it that's all I hear I hear
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
how you're interpreting it why if the
 
04:07:17.950 --> 04:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
disposition is plan is required in order
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
to get a charter correct right so if
 
04:07:24.510 --> 04:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's um required to get schooled
 
04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
building Aid why would you even add this
 
04:07:30.189 --> 04:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
uh because there is already a
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
disposition plan if it's a charter
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
school there's already one so if you
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
want to get building Aid doesn't it uh
 
04:07:38.830 --> 04:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
follow that you would update the uh
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
disposition plan in order to accommodate
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
for the school building Aid you're
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
receiving I think that makes perfect
 
04:07:47.710 --> 04:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
sense represent cell but it doesn't say
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
that it does it doesn't say update
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't say new I agree with you the
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
thinking is logical but it doesn't mean
 
04:07:54.189 --> 04:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
it's right it's not here it's not in
 
04:07:56.349 --> 04:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
print oh I think my thinking was logical
 
04:07:59.309 --> 04:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
and right I'm not surprised that
 
04:08:03.109 --> 04:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
either okay represent he
 
04:08:07.109 --> 04:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
um not many Charters are owned the
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
buildings are owned I think there was a
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
handful of them um this is very
 
04:08:11.600 --> 04:08:13.269 align:start position:0%
handful of them um this is very
unchartered

04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
unchartered
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
territory um and I
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
honestly I I have mixed feelings about
 
04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
it quite frankly because our Charters
 
04:08:24.510 --> 04:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
have provided a lot of wonderful things
 
04:08:25.870 --> 04:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
but the thing
 
04:08:30.269 --> 04:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
is the way this bill is specified if I'm
 
04:08:34.349 --> 04:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
buying a if I'm do asking for building
 
04:08:36.630 --> 04:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
Aid and then I'm getting money over a
 
04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
period of 20 years
 
04:08:40.990 --> 04:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
years just the whole the way the whole
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
thing is set up is is difficult then I
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
really do think I think um
 
04:08:47.550 --> 04:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock has a really
 
04:08:51.229 --> 04:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
important point when we get
 
04:08:53.950 --> 04:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
building when we get building Aid
 
04:08:57.149 --> 04:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
there's a plan and and Amy is checking
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
on the manner in which that gets spent
 
04:09:01.229 --> 04:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
when you get building Aid you don't get
 
04:09:03.070 --> 04:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
everything you want you get what she
 
04:09:05.550 --> 04:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
approves only it would be the same thing
 
04:09:07.710 --> 04:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
with the charter they would get only
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
what she has approved but in fact there
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be some kind of in any good
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
business if you're dissolving you need
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
to get have a plan not just assets how
 
04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
do you repay that money back to the
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
state if your building is dissolve if
 
04:09:29.550 --> 04:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
the charter is dissolved I just I think
 
04:09:31.790 --> 04:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of you know I'm I'm
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
gonna I have no feelings about should we
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
do this or not I'm I'm mixed about it
 
04:09:39.750 --> 04:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
I'm ambivalent but I think this bill as
 
04:09:42.990 --> 04:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
written needs some work I think some
 
04:09:45.550 --> 04:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
things need to be sorted out and spelled
 
04:09:48.510 --> 04:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
out better I mean just from my coming
 
04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
from the finance committee this could be
 
04:09:53.910 --> 04:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
confusing and I don't think we can make
 
04:09:56.109 --> 04:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
assumptions about what's going to be in
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
an asset plan or what's not we have to
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
say especially when we're giving
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
building Aid we've never done this
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
before we need to spell it out correctly
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
minute she has she's been working with
 
04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
us on and supports the idea that even
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
the concept the intent that Charter
 
04:10:22.030 --> 04:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
Schools receive this there's a lot of
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
different legislation out there from
 
04:10:27.790 --> 04:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
state to state and how they do this we
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
prefer to write the in fact in working
 
04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
with the dissolution committing on
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools the way we initially had
 
04:10:37.469 --> 04:10:37.479 align:start position:0%
it because we were saying you got to put
 
04:10:39.070 --> 04:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
put up some kind of a bond you got to
 
04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
put up some indemnification Bond you
 
04:10:42.670 --> 04:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
have to put up an escroll account you
 
04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it might
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
be and it was decide no that's not the
 
04:10:51.389 --> 04:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
go that's right and there are assets and
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
when we had the charitable trusts coming
 
04:10:59.389 --> 04:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
in testifying it and saying hey that
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
they are accountable for audit to the
 
04:11:06.189 --> 04:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
charitable trust not the Department of
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
Education and
 
04:11:10.030 --> 04:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
and and so there there's a process in
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
this law in fact even ends up in the
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
courts and for the disposition of of
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
assets that can happen it can happen
 
04:11:20.149 --> 04:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
with any type of
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
organization however when we're looking
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
at the assets and we look at the types
 
04:11:25.830 --> 04:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
of assets these uh these charter schools
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
have and the amount of money they're
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
receiving here the that would cover what
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
they've received in State Building eight
 
04:11:36.189 --> 04:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
or renovation
 
04:11:41.109 --> 04:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
cascad thank you just um looking for a
 
04:11:48.910 --> 04:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of claric clarification so I
 
04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
can understand this whole picture so far
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
I understand what you've been presenting
 
04:11:55.389 --> 04:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
my experien is with North Country
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
Charter Academy serving on a Board of
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
Trustees two sites Lancaster
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
Littleton they apply for building Aid
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
they get awarded it they're going to
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
renovate a
 
04:12:06.279 --> 04:12:07.990 align:start position:0%
renovate a
site

04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
site
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
do the voters of Lancaster and Littleton
 
04:12:13.830 --> 04:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
both vote on that approval of that
 
04:12:16.269 --> 04:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
construction project
 
04:12:20.429 --> 04:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
or even if it's in a single town do the
 
04:12:24.670 --> 04:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
voters vote on whether that's a project
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
or not because I believe any other
 
04:12:30.670 --> 04:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
public school the voters it would be the
 
04:12:34.030 --> 04:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
trustees of that Charter seeing that the
 
04:12:36.830 --> 04:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
charter you're talking about has seats
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
available from numerous school districts
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
in fact I am in one of those districts
 
04:12:45.070 --> 04:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
yep yep and so that it wouldn't be
 
04:12:48.030 --> 04:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
hail's obligation it wouldn't be
 
04:12:50.910 --> 04:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
Berlin's obligation it would be that of
 
04:12:53.870 --> 04:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
the trustees of that Charter School not
 
04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
where it's
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
located not not not the resident
 
04:13:02.590 --> 04:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
District of not Littleton right okay so
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
the voters do not have the say of
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
approving a construction project are
 
04:13:11.550 --> 04:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
not right the the approval is done by
 
04:13:12.990 --> 04:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:13:16.510 --> 04:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
board right so the initial approval to
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
apply would be your trustees okay got it
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah yes just a question
 
04:13:27.990 --> 04:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
on that so you are saying that
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
the board or the trustees of that
 
04:13:32.990 --> 04:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
Charter are taking on the
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
liability for that
 
04:13:36.159 --> 04:13:37.670 align:start position:0%
liability for that
loan

04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
loan
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
or for that building a grant yes and
 
04:13:41.630 --> 04:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
they've been doing that according to the
 
04:13:43.309 --> 04:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
charitable trust that's what they are
 
04:13:45.710 --> 04:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
because that's their organizational
 
04:13:47.309 --> 04:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
structure but they've never had money
 
04:13:48.630 --> 04:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
before in well they've had Grants
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
awarded that's right not building Aid
 
04:13:56.469 --> 04:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
per se yeah Federal grant money has
 
04:13:59.309 --> 04:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
started these things up and state
 
04:14:03.109 --> 04:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
Appropriations all right but but I think
 
04:14:04.990 --> 04:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell was next I just
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
had a question about if once we've on
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
this bill if if it passes does it go to
 
04:14:11.109 --> 04:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
another committee like does it go to
 
04:14:13.389 --> 04:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
finance or anything to be reviewed for
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
the financial parts of it the answer is
 
04:14:19.309 --> 04:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
yes uh the
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
there we we we're talking about a number
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
of bills here which have dollars you
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
know for example if we were looking at
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
the uh reimbursement for Teacher
 
04:14:32.510 --> 04:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
shortage and all that for looking at the
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
one and a half to from three and a half
 
04:14:38.030 --> 04:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
on cat a you're talking certainly that's
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're all going to trip down towards
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
Finance or a second Committee of some
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
kind I would represent Lun so thank you
 
04:14:48.109 --> 04:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair I just want to
 
04:14:50.149 --> 04:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
clarify something I I here and make sure
 
04:14:52.469 --> 04:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
we get it on the record so is there
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
something in House Bill 354 or anywhere
 
04:14:58.590 --> 04:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
else in the law or anything in the doj
 
04:15:01.870 --> 04:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
policy that would hold the trustees
 
04:15:05.389 --> 04:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
personally liable for um uh for State
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
Building Aid should the
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
be dissolved within the 20-year
 
04:15:13.710 --> 04:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
period I I don't know I I know of
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
nothing it was implied that there was
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
that there was liability by the trustees
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm just I want that's a very
 
04:15:23.109 --> 04:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
important thing because anybody that's
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
owned a business and has co-signed a
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
personal guarantee to a to a commercial
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
loan understands what that what that
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
personal liability is I want to know for
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
the record if the legislative intent of
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
liable that would not be my
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
view so is your view different than what
 
04:15:49.319 --> 04:15:51.309 align:start position:0%
view so is your view different than what
representative

04:15:51.309 --> 04:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:15:54.389 --> 04:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
lad it sometimes
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
is thank
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
you yeah he's he's a southern boy I'm a
 
04:15:59.279 --> 04:16:01.349 align:start position:0%
you yeah he's he's a southern boy I'm a
northern

04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
northern
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
boy represent
 
04:16:08.189 --> 04:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
Tanner so if the trustees are not liable
 
04:16:12.269 --> 04:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
uh held liable then who is who and I
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
guess we're back to the same question
 
04:16:16.830 --> 04:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
when I look up if a if a normal charity
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
just a charity goes bankrupt um you know
 
04:16:23.349 --> 04:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
they go into receivership or they the
 
04:16:25.389 --> 04:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
you know federal government comes in
 
04:16:29.109 --> 04:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
takes over we this is a kind of a unique
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
situation um because they are nonprofits
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
and they are with a charitable
 
04:16:36.429 --> 04:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
organization registered with them and
 
04:16:38.910 --> 04:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
yet they kind of are with the
 
04:16:42.670 --> 04:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
doe um and we're using taxpayer money so
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
we've got a nonprofit receiving taxpayer
 
04:16:49.469 --> 04:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
money um and I just you know again just
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
coming back kind of circling back so who
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
is liable who who's on the hook for this
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
you know I let me just respond to this
 
04:16:59.710 --> 04:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
because I think we can go on forever
 
04:17:03.109 --> 04:17:03.119 align:start position:0%
here with this type of questioning uh
 
04:17:06.269 --> 04:17:06.279 align:start position:0%
however I'm looking at this strictly as
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
we're at to do so as a policy issue do
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
we believe that we want to have all
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
students in structures which are
 
04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
satisfactory and meet those minimum
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
standards Public School approval and and
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
it this most likely would go to a second
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
committee and these are the type of
 
04:17:28.389 --> 04:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
questions for the second committee which
 
04:17:30.510 --> 04:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
are dealing with dollars and
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
liability and and how we ensure that the
 
04:17:35.950 --> 04:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
state's not going to remain on the hook
 
04:17:37.870 --> 04:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
uh but that's not a question for this
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee at this time this is do we
 
04:17:43.109 --> 04:17:43.119 align:start position:0%
believe that charter schools are are are
 
04:17:45.870 --> 04:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
better supported through funding from
 
04:17:48.030 --> 04:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
the state in terms of renovation or
 
04:17:51.109 --> 04:17:51.119 align:start position:0%
construction building Aid I personally
 
04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
think yes now whether we can you know
 
04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
afford it or do it that's going to be
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.349 --> 04:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
decision CH yes so thanks I'll I'll I'll
 
04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
put a comment out in a in a different
 
04:18:09.309 --> 04:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
direction too than what than what we've
 
04:18:12.109 --> 04:18:12.119 align:start position:0%
been talking about but with over $200
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
million in um in uh building Aid
 
04:18:18.750 --> 04:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
requests by by public school districts
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
so now we're talking about taxpayer
 
04:18:24.670 --> 04:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
owned taxpayer funded uh Public Schools
 
04:18:27.990 --> 04:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
$200 million worth of um worth of
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
projects I think it's important that we
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
use taxpayer money to uh to reduce the
 
04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
burden for our taxpayers and uh
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
and and I I think given the fact that
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
we've had a 10-year um moratorium on um
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
on building Aid that that we need to get
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
back to business supporting our um our
 
04:18:54.149 --> 04:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
our taxpayer um and our our public
 
04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
schools and not uh not um you know
 
04:19:00.269 --> 04:19:00.279 align:start position:0%
private non-for-profit um schools thank
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
you I would just say I
 
04:19:07.950 --> 04:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
think for me this bill um Prim primarily
 
04:19:10.710 --> 04:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
resolves the one remaining conflict that
 
04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
we have in statute uh between different
 
04:19:16.229 --> 04:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
areas in Statute in that in one area
 
04:19:19.389 --> 04:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
this says Charter Schools shall receive
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
um building Aid and in another it
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't so if you know we'll be all set
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
with our statutes if we resolve this one
 
04:19:25.600 --> 04:19:28.710 align:start position:0%
with our statutes if we resolve this one
remaining

04:19:28.710 --> 04:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:33.030 --> 04:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
issue okay rep representative
 
04:19:36.109 --> 04:19:36.119 align:start position:0%
Ford I'd like to introduce just maybe a
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
slightly different perspective I don't
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
know if you've ever had the unfortunate
 
04:19:44.670 --> 04:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to close down an institution
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
like a school but I have and one of the
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
things that happens is there's no money
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
left there's no money to pay anything
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
and if all you have is a building then
 
04:20:01.550 --> 04:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
you fall into the legal wrangling
 
04:20:04.990 --> 04:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
over who this person's liability this
 
04:20:08.429 --> 04:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
person's salary at etc etc and then all
 
04:20:11.070 --> 04:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
that all gets eaten up in
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
litigation so you wind up with those
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
expenses piled on top of it it would be
 
04:20:20.189 --> 04:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
much simpler if the goal of this
 
04:20:22.750 --> 04:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee would simply resolve this
 
04:20:25.469 --> 04:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
issue by simply saying this must be
 
04:20:28.229 --> 04:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
bonded and the bonding will repay the
 
04:20:31.750 --> 04:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
state should this institution fail then
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
you're done otherwise you're going to
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
wind up in this cely you're in right now
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
you can't get there from here but the
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
money won't be there I can promise you
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
that I've seen it
 
04:20:48.990 --> 04:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
go and when it's gone it's gone is the
 
04:20:49.000 --> 04:20:50.030 align:start position:0%
go and when it's gone it's gone is the
saying

04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:20:53.590 --> 04:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
has so there won't be anything to fight
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
over regardless of who really deserves
 
04:21:01.269 --> 04:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
what it'll be a lot better if you make a
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
decision Bond it fine make them buy a
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
bond and that's the end of it but that
 
04:21:10.349 --> 04:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
way everybody's liability is
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
limited you know I I'll speak to that
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
because I totally
 
04:21:15.000 --> 04:21:17.309 align:start position:0%
because I totally
disagree

04:21:17.309 --> 04:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
04:21:19.590 --> 04:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
that when we're starting about a charter
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
school we're talking
 
04:21:23.870 --> 04:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
startups and if you're trying to say
 
04:21:25.109 --> 04:21:25.119 align:start position:0%
well we're never going to have a charter
 
04:21:26.469 --> 04:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
school because they're never going to
 
04:21:27.870 --> 04:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
have the money for an escr account
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're never going to have the money
 
04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
for a letter of credit they're never
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
going to have a bond and they're never
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to be able to have a deed of trust
 
04:21:35.550 --> 04:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have these things in
 
04:21:36.910 --> 04:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
place how are you ever going to have a
 
04:21:40.030 --> 04:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
charter school and I've been around here
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
for a while and seen charter schools
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
start and I've seen one charter school
 
04:21:45.550 --> 04:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
situation where we had $10 million
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
sitting here that we had appropriated
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
for it and the state refused to use
 
04:21:51.389 --> 04:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
those $10 million and they had already
 
04:21:53.389 --> 04:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
put out a lease and we're already in
 
04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
debt and you know I I think that if
 
04:21:57.910 --> 04:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to recognize the value
 
04:21:59.429 --> 04:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
of charter schools and what they're
 
04:22:02.830 --> 04:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
providing we all know that one school is
 
04:22:05.070 --> 04:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
not always going to be the best fit for
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
a child and this is an opportunity for
 
04:22:10.429 --> 04:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
us to support this concept where we're
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
looking for every child succeeding with
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
their learning process so you know it's
 
04:22:21.229 --> 04:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a difficult issue yes but I
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
think we can Wade through this other
 
04:22:26.189 --> 04:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
states have done that and some states
 
04:22:28.990 --> 04:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
that are have more students involved
 
04:22:33.070 --> 04:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
with it and and and and maybe go the the
 
04:22:34.950 --> 04:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
direction you just mentioned representa
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
Ford but those those options we looked
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
at in the
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
dissolution committee and we looked at
 
04:22:44.710 --> 04:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
one specifically the bonding and that
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
was decided no that's not a direction we
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
should go and that's why it's
 
04:22:52.030 --> 04:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
out represent
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
Miler I'd like to call the question
 
04:22:54.399 --> 04:22:55.510 align:start position:0%
Miler I'd like to call the question
please

04:22:55.510 --> 04:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
good I think it's a good
 
04:23:01.389 --> 04:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
idea any further
 
04:23:04.349 --> 04:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
discussion one more and then that's it
 
04:23:06.790 --> 04:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you Mr I'll be Qui
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to to lay out that I spoke
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
to uh somebody I know who was a school
 
04:23:12.189 --> 04:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
board member in the North Country a
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
while back and it really gives truth to
 
04:23:18.750 --> 04:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
the idea that there there is also um
 
04:23:20.990 --> 04:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
liability for not liability is not the
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
right word but there's risk
 
04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
involved in public schools of All Sorts
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
he was talking about this school that
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
they built they spent a ton of money on
 
04:23:30.750 --> 04:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
it and it turned up over a period of
 
04:23:33.030 --> 04:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
time they lost population so they wound
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
up a build a building bigger than they
 
04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
needed which is now costing them extra
 
04:23:38.590 --> 04:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
money because they have to do upkeep on
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
a building bigger than they need with a
 
04:23:43.149 --> 04:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
smaller population so I think it's
 
04:23:45.309 --> 04:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
important that we recognize that in all
 
04:23:47.710 --> 04:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
forms of public school whether it be the
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
traditional government style or Charter
 
04:23:52.670 --> 04:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
there are risks to the state that we
 
04:23:54.269 --> 04:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
consider acceptable because we consider
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
a charge to educate children because
 
04:24:00.030 --> 04:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're doing thank you
 
04:24:02.189 --> 04:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
thank you okay we're going to call the
 
04:24:04.229 --> 04:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
question right now we have an amendment
 
04:24:07.870 --> 04:24:07.880 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:27:59.109 --> 04:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:02.910 --> 04:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
M I'll I'll speak to my motion okay go
 
04:28:06.030 --> 04:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
ahead you know this obviously this is a
 
04:28:08.910 --> 04:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time on it and there's
 
04:28:12.670 --> 04:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
a concern about the whole issue of U
 
04:28:15.670 --> 04:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
school building Aid in general and uh
 
04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
this has another component to it and I
 
04:28:21.309 --> 04:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
just think it might be have some value
 
04:28:24.149 --> 04:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
to at least keep it in advance uh so
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to have further
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
look at it uh particularly as uh as
 
04:28:30.990 --> 04:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
chairman lad has said as we begin to
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
look at the uh tail being paid off and
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
if there's more more funds that are
 
04:28:40.349 --> 04:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
going to be available as that is done it
 
04:28:42.630 --> 04:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
might provide more resources than for
 
04:28:44.229 --> 04:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
for building Aid and I just think it
 
04:28:46.510 --> 04:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea to kind of just
 
04:28:49.630 --> 04:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
keep it out there and not just uh put it
 
04:28:52.510 --> 04:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
to a potential being killed uh on the
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
floor by whoever shows up on that
 
04:28:54.399 --> 04:28:57.070 align:start position:0%
floor by whoever shows up on that
particular

04:28:57.070 --> 04:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:01.910 --> 04:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
day okay I'd like to speak to the motion
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
to on June 12th September 14th on
 
04:29:09.670 --> 04:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
October 5th on October 18th and October
 
04:29:12.670 --> 04:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
31st we've been discussing this
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill and as a policy I think uh it comes
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
out fa clearly to me that some are
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
supporting moving forward with this
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and some are not
 
04:29:30.189 --> 04:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
and I I I think at this point in time
 
04:29:32.030 --> 04:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes it been wonderful to send this to a
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
second committee that could have had a
 
04:29:37.790 --> 04:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
an answer maybe some of the issues which
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
we talk about in terms dealing with a
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
charitable trust dealing with Finance uh
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
those are issues I think most of us all
 
04:29:47.309 --> 04:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
recognize there may be still some issues
 
04:29:48.550 --> 04:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
that need some
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
resolution but in fact to keep that in
 
04:29:54.349 --> 04:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
this committee for an interim
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
study where I don't believe we have all
 
04:29:59.149 --> 04:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
the you know
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
the the angles represented at this table
 
04:30:04.349 --> 04:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
other words represent Heath you're here
 
04:30:05.870 --> 04:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
from Finance you have some
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
understandings what's going on in
 
04:30:09.429 --> 04:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
finance whereas many of us are not part
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
of that although we do attend uh I am
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
not supportive of interim study on this
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
bill I I feel that it's time to take it
 
04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
to the house floor and present present
 
04:30:23.229 --> 04:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
it to our whole body and see where we
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
are with it um it it's something that I
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
think is is critical it's it's a top
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
priority to myself this bill right here
 
04:30:35.229 --> 04:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
of all the bills we're looking at today
 
04:30:37.349 --> 04:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's the one that's the one that's most
 
04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
important to me building Aid whether it
 
04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
be for a rigger school or a charter
 
04:30:45.070 --> 04:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
school is important it's if you don't
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
have a decent building you're not going
 
04:30:49.710 --> 04:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide the education
 
04:30:51.429 --> 04:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
that's necessary we've seen that new
 
04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
construction new buildings clean
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
buildings the achievement scores of kids
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
are at least 15 percentile points
 
04:31:00.750 --> 04:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
higher you're not going to give the
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
charter school kids the chance I think
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's appalling and I'm I'm I'm really
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh sad this committee is where it is on
 
04:31:12.670 --> 04:31:12.680 align:start position:0%

Mr chair I would move to interim study
 
04:34:12.910 --> 04:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
this I'll second it I'll speak to that
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
speak to it now okay in in the spirit
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
since we have uh 12 more more bills to
 
04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
consider this afternoon uh I think it's
 
04:34:23.709 --> 04:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
time to move this along uh there is a
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
bill first of all I need to apologize to
 
04:34:28.470 --> 04:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
the committee because this bill is not
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
what I thought it was going to be and I
 
04:34:33.629 --> 04:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
was away and did not have a chance to do
 
04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
the due diligence that I should have
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
done done so I apologize the committee
 
04:34:39.390 --> 04:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
to that there is a bill coming forward I
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
believe from the Senate which is very
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
similar to this 217 Senate Bill 2117
 
04:34:46.750 --> 04:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
which will give us an opportunity to
 
04:34:48.310 --> 04:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
look at it at that point in time so at
 
04:34:50.230 --> 04:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
this point in time I just move to move
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
it to interim study at this point in
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
24568 sir a second Peron dry Peron leus
 
04:39:58.750 --> 04:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
okay so what I've done for this
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
amendment we had a awful lot of
 
04:40:02.830 --> 04:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
conversation about the committee being
 
04:40:04.910 --> 04:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
too big and how we could manage that and
 
04:40:08.030 --> 04:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
how we could reduce it and so
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative dry and myself and um one
 
04:40:14.230 --> 04:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
of the people who had come in one of the
 
04:40:16.750 --> 04:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
public who had come in to help who had a
 
04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
lot of information on this sat down at
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
lunch and went over all of the things to
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
try to figure out just what was required
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
by the federal law and we came up with a
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
list and that if we only do what's
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
required by the federal law that's 25
 
04:40:37.868 --> 04:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
people that comes
 
04:40:41.230 --> 04:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
to I have added this just takes that
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
plus two additional one would be the
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
member from the um home school because
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's been in state law for a while and
 
04:40:53.788 --> 04:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
that was on all the Amendments everybody
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
agreed to that one and that way all
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
students require regardless of what type
 
04:41:00.510 --> 04:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
of school they go to have a
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative so that was just to make
 
04:41:04.350 --> 04:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
sure because the federal government
 
04:41:06.310 --> 04:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it in cuz not all school
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
not all states are allow
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
homeschool so um but we do so I left
 
04:41:16.670 --> 04:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
that in and the only other thing that I
 
04:41:19.150 --> 04:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
put in was the health care professional
 
04:41:21.470 --> 04:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
who deals with children because that was
 
04:41:23.670 --> 04:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
the whole point of the bill that was why
 
04:41:25.868 --> 04:41:25.878 align:start position:0%
it was introduced and we all agreed on
 
04:41:29.470 --> 04:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
that everything else I took
 
04:41:32.670 --> 04:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
out um doesn't mean they can't be there
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's a public it's a public public
 
04:41:38.030 --> 04:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
committee if Representatives want to
 
04:41:42.030 --> 04:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
show up they can show up if pic or some
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
of those other people want to show up
 
04:41:45.948 --> 04:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
they can show up but they're not part of
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
the membership so nobody's counting on
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
them I did put uh one non-voting member
 
04:41:55.948 --> 04:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
I we talked about making lots of people
 
04:41:58.350 --> 04:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
non- voting members which I didn't want
 
04:42:02.788 --> 04:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
to get into but we had also talked about
 
04:42:06.270 --> 04:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
um a member of the de e for technical
 
04:42:08.830 --> 04:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
support like making sure the zoom
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
meeting was working Etc and so I
 
04:42:13.708 --> 04:42:13.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out how else to put them
 
04:42:15.390 --> 04:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
in to make sure they came but I didn't
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
want them to be part of the membership
 
04:42:20.030 --> 04:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
so I did say non- voting member but I
 
04:42:21.628 --> 04:42:21.638 align:start position:0%
didn't really want to get in a non-
 
04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
voting member um but I wanted to make
 
04:42:26.590 --> 04:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
sure they show up anybody else is
 
04:42:29.070 --> 04:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
optional so we're not saying those
 
04:42:30.510 --> 04:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
people can't come and we're not saying
 
04:42:32.670 --> 04:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
they can't participate we're just not
 
04:42:36.430 --> 04:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
making it part of the membership so they
 
04:42:39.070 --> 04:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
can come if they want to or not it's up
 
04:42:43.150 --> 04:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
to them um so basically this is just the
 
04:42:46.070 --> 04:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
minimum and it comes to 29 people which
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
is much better than the 40 something
 
04:42:52.270 --> 04:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
that we had in there so that's this is
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
just barebones amendment to try to get
 
04:42:58.830 --> 04:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
the absolute minimum number of people
 
04:43:00.430 --> 04:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
who have to be
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
there represent luus how many parents
 
04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
are on this now vers how many total
 
04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
members in the committee there's um 14
 
04:43:10.150 --> 04:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
and 14 there's
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
14 there's 14 members who are who can be
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
parents there are 14 members otherwise
 
04:43:21.310 --> 04:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
and the other one is um one individual
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
with disabilities who may have received
 
04:43:25.590 --> 04:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
special education services and who may
 
04:43:27.190 --> 04:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
be a high school student appointed by
 
04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
the governor and I and that was
 
04:43:31.628 --> 04:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
originally separated out then it got
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
included into the first part and the
 
04:43:35.868 --> 04:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
problem with including it is you could
 
04:43:39.230 --> 04:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
have all parents and not have any
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
special ed um any individuals with
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities so the federal had it as
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
separate and I put it still as separate
 
04:43:52.868 --> 04:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
but it counts in the it counts in the
 
04:43:57.030 --> 04:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
parents and special needs number not in
 
04:44:00.910 --> 04:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
the regular member number so I'm a
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
little confused yeah so we're we I can
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
remember talking to I don't remember
 
04:44:11.868 --> 04:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
which attorney but saying you couldn't
 
04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
be a parent and a representative in some
 
04:44:16.708 --> 04:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
other category well no that's not what
 
04:44:21.150 --> 04:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
I'm saying the point is the first we had
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
combined the federal had two separate
 
04:44:26.310 --> 04:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
sections and we had combined them into
 
04:44:30.030 --> 04:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
one that says individuals disabilities
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
or parents of children but you could
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
meet that requirement just with parents
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
but the point was there needs to be one
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
individual with disabilities who's a
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
member and the federal had it separated
 
04:44:48.190 --> 04:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
out I separated it back out but it
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
counts in the total of majority of
 
04:44:53.190 --> 04:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
committee membership composed of
 
04:44:55.750 --> 04:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities or parents
 
04:44:57.910 --> 04:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
of children with disab the toal voting
 
04:45:01.948 --> 04:45:01.958 align:start position:0%
membership is what 29 29
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
okay and 14 are parents no 14 are
 
04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
parents or people with disabilities one
 
04:45:12.310 --> 04:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
is someone with a disability and 14 are
 
04:45:14.990 --> 04:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
the other members and that's just to put
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
it back the way the
 
04:45:19.470 --> 04:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
federal wanted it it could be zero
 
04:45:22.830 --> 04:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
parents it could be 15 people with
 
04:45:22.840 --> 04:45:24.470 align:start position:0%
parents it could be 15 people with
disabilities

04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just it got separated out to
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
ensure that at least one member has
 
04:45:33.470 --> 04:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities which is the way it was
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
originally in the the federal
 
04:45:37.150 --> 04:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
representative bbon you have
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
hand um yeah I'm on the commit thank you
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
chairman lad um being on the committee
 
04:45:46.590 --> 04:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
I've have heard a lot about the
 
04:45:49.150 --> 04:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
dysfunction in the committee and a lot
 
04:45:51.788 --> 04:45:51.798 align:start position:0%
of the reasoning behind it and it seems
 
04:45:54.030 --> 04:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that there's not a lot of
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
support um that's being given to the
 
04:45:58.708 --> 04:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
committee in terms of administrative
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
Technical and
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
organizational um I apologize I was not
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
able to be here at the last meeting when
 
04:46:08.190 --> 04:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
this was discussed but I think it's
 
04:46:10.788 --> 04:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
important to note um that there's an
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
audit currently being
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
conducted and and part of that audit is
 
04:46:18.190 --> 04:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
looking at this particular committee the
 
04:46:19.948 --> 04:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
audit is being conducted by the office
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
of legislative budget assistant and the
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
results will be published in the spring
 
04:46:29.470 --> 04:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
my concern um because we keep coming
 
04:46:30.910 --> 04:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
back and we keep changing the
 
04:46:34.230 --> 04:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
composition and looking at is that let
 
04:46:37.628 --> 04:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
let's do this the right way let's wait
 
04:46:40.830 --> 04:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
until we get the results from the audit
 
04:46:42.430 --> 04:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
which I believe are going to have pretty
 
04:46:42.440 --> 04:46:43.708 align:start position:0%
which I believe are going to have pretty
clear

04:46:43.708 --> 04:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations on perhaps the
 
04:46:48.390 --> 04:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
composition but at the bare minimum what
 
04:46:51.150 --> 04:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be done to get this committee
 
04:46:53.190 --> 04:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh with a very important Mission by the
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
way to function the way it's supposed to
 
04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
so I won't be voting for any amendments
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
I really think that we have to step back
 
04:47:02.948 --> 04:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
and put it into an interim study and
 
04:47:05.868 --> 04:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
wait for the results of the thank you
 
04:47:07.868 --> 04:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
just for those that are new on the
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
committee a performance audit is done by
 
04:47:10.200 --> 04:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
committee a performance audit is done by
the

04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
LBA and it is that a situation which may
 
04:47:20.110 --> 04:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
be really needing an investigation and
 
04:47:22.708 --> 04:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
the LBA legislative budget Assistance
 
04:47:25.948 --> 04:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
Office does this thoroughly and we did
 
04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
this with the
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
um uh special education advisor wasn't
 
04:47:36.910 --> 04:47:36.920 align:start position:0%

04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
valon and
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah what could I call
 
04:47:59.628 --> 04:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
verify is is have you received on your
 
04:48:02.350 --> 04:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
committee any kind of contact from the
 
04:48:04.350 --> 04:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
LBA that they've already started started
 
04:48:04.360 --> 04:48:06.070 align:start position:0%
LBA that they've already started started
this

04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
audit um yes the audit has already begun
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
the observations have already been made
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
um the next steps up are the uh
 
04:48:15.788 --> 04:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
committee is going to be talking to the
 
04:48:18.030 --> 04:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
various representatives and giving them
 
04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to respond and I believe
 
04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
that will occur in January and February
 
04:48:25.788 --> 04:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
and then taking that feedback back they
 
04:48:27.868 --> 04:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
will produce a final report I think in
 
04:48:31.788 --> 04:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
April and report back at that time thank
 
04:48:34.990 --> 04:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
you further discussion represent Hall
 
04:48:36.990 --> 04:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Bon but I'm
 
04:48:38.590 --> 04:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
also curious I have a question for
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative leas on the when we had
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
the testimony heard the testimony pick
 
04:48:46.548 --> 04:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
in the DRC wasn't she totally in favor
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
of having them on and how did they get
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
off I'm just curious um she was totally
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
in favor we heard from lots and lots of
 
04:48:58.270 --> 04:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
parents who were not in favor we've
 
04:49:00.190 --> 04:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
that's been because that was one of
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
those controversial issues and some
 
04:49:05.110 --> 04:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
wanted and some didn't I didn't put them
 
04:49:08.350 --> 04:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
on they're welcome to show up as it's
 
04:49:12.190 --> 04:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
public right they're not membership okay
 
04:49:14.350 --> 04:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
I was just wonder because you had talked
 
04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
about she was things that everybody
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
agreed on except
 
04:49:23.030 --> 04:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
her not well I didn't know if I had have
 
04:49:24.430 --> 04:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
known I would have never put an
 
04:49:26.990 --> 04:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
amendment in no okay thank you I didn't
 
04:49:28.788 --> 04:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
mean representative bbon I metant the
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
woman who
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
testified yes represent Miler thank you
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
I I want to thank representative alone
 
04:49:39.310 --> 04:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
for the information I think clearly
 
04:49:40.670 --> 04:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's very important for this committee
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
to have I do have a couple questions
 
04:49:45.030 --> 04:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
though for uh representative
 
04:49:48.070 --> 04:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
Lakers during the testimony the as I
 
04:49:51.270 --> 04:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
recall one of the frustrations of the
 
04:49:53.948 --> 04:49:53.958 align:start position:0%
people who are on the group right
 
04:49:57.628 --> 04:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
now is the issue of oversight on the
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
part of the department support on the
 
04:50:02.548 --> 04:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
part of the department funding on the
 
04:50:04.628 --> 04:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
part of the department believe they were
 
04:50:07.030 --> 04:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the need for some training
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
some professional development if you may
 
04:50:13.750 --> 04:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
Etc and I so my first question is why
 
04:50:16.548 --> 04:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
wasn't there some recognition in your
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
amendment to deal with that
 
04:50:21.628 --> 04:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
administrative and funding piece that's
 
04:50:23.310 --> 04:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
my first question I've got a second one
 
04:50:27.070 --> 04:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
after that well I did that was the point
 
04:50:32.030 --> 04:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
of um oh one non-voting State education
 
04:50:33.310 --> 04:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
official from the Department of
 
04:50:35.350 --> 04:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
Education appointed by the commissioner
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
of Education to serve in a technical
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
support role and I didn't spell out what
 
04:50:42.750 --> 04:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
technical support it could be any of
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
those things it could for all of those
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
things and it could be setting up it
 
04:50:49.670 --> 04:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
could be setting up the zoom meeting I
 
04:50:52.628 --> 04:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
mean it's whatever is needed the second
 
04:50:55.470 --> 04:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
question is um I noticed that the
 
04:50:58.708 --> 04:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center and the uh
 
04:51:00.910 --> 04:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
parent information center is not in here
 
04:51:02.990 --> 04:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
why are they excluded from well that's
 
04:51:05.548 --> 04:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
what I was just saying because we heard
 
04:51:07.110 --> 04:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
from people who wanted them we heard
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
from a number of parents who did not
 
04:51:12.990 --> 04:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
want them because they were one of those
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
um controversial members and so I just
 
04:51:19.030 --> 04:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
tried to put the bare minimum and they
 
04:51:25.868 --> 04:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:27.868 --> 04:51:27.878 align:start position:0%
member representative
 
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um I can't begin to
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
tell you how many hours I spent on this
 
04:51:35.628 --> 04:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
on the phone phone with different people
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
um because I was in charge of making the
 
04:51:41.230 --> 04:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
First Amendment for it and unfortunately
 
04:51:45.310 --> 04:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
I was not able to make the um retain
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
Bill committee meeting on it uh when
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
representative leus was given the
 
04:51:52.990 --> 04:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
commission of going back to Bare Bones
 
04:51:58.548 --> 04:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
right so um just my conclusion is uh
 
04:52:00.750 --> 04:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
from everything i' all the input I've
 
04:52:03.310 --> 04:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
had what I've tried to do people I've
 
04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
talked to is exactly what representative
 
04:52:10.708 --> 04:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
balbon said that the this committee that
 
04:52:12.628 --> 04:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
functioned very well before coid
 
04:52:15.750 --> 04:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
functions terribly right now um some of
 
04:52:20.070 --> 04:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
it is due to uh the person personalities
 
04:52:21.670 --> 04:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
that are involved in the committee and
 
04:52:24.590 --> 04:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
as I said to many people legislatively
 
04:52:26.470 --> 04:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
we don't deal with personalities and we
 
04:52:28.510 --> 04:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
can't fix that kind of thing that's got
 
04:52:32.310 --> 04:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
to be fixed from within and that people
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
that are represented in different groups
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
on this committee um have all feel as
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
though they're giving adequate
 
04:52:42.430 --> 04:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
information uh yet some people on the
 
04:52:45.390 --> 04:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
committee feel that they're not and uh
 
04:52:47.230 --> 04:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
also one of the outstanding things that
 
04:52:49.788 --> 04:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
I heard was that uh there's not a lot of
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
support what they really need is uh
 
04:52:54.030 --> 04:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
strategic planning and they need some
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
facilitation on how to work as a
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
committee because whether you have what
 
04:53:03.708 --> 04:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
do you have 20 20 29 or you have 33 or
 
04:53:06.830 --> 04:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
you have 47 once you get over 15 you've
 
04:53:08.628 --> 04:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
got to have really good organization in
 
04:53:11.070 --> 04:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
order for a committee to work and to be
 
04:53:12.910 --> 04:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
functional and come out you know with
 
04:53:15.868 --> 04:53:15.878 align:start position:0%
some really uh decent things and
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
evidently they did that before coid um
 
04:53:22.110 --> 04:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
and now they're not so and not much has
 
04:53:24.670 --> 04:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
changed other than uh they you know they
 
04:53:26.230 --> 04:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
would like to do Zoom they don't get
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
Zoom they um have some questions about
 
04:53:32.070 --> 04:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
being reimbursed about mileage um some
 
04:53:34.910 --> 04:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
are some aren't they have some questions
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
about whether there's funds at the state
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
department in order for them to have
 
04:53:41.150 --> 04:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
somebody come in to help them facilitate
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
the meetings and also do some strategic
 
04:53:47.948 --> 04:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
planning answer is yes answer is no you
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
know back and forth so at this point I
 
04:53:56.310 --> 04:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
came in with amendment that I withdrew
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
on the basis that I was going to offer
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
interim uh study for this because again
 
04:54:04.390 --> 04:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
I it's something that up here we can't
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
solve what's broken down there and it is
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
a very very important committee and some
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
people a lot the people that I talk to
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
are passionate about it they they really
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
on either side they really want things
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
to work um and I think if uh a outside
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
study a third group study on this on
 
04:54:29.110 --> 04:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
this Council uh can give some
 
04:54:31.150 --> 04:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions um and if the State
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh steps up a
 
04:54:34.628 --> 04:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
little little bit in their
 
04:54:37.110 --> 04:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
facilitation um I think it can work but
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's you talk about government
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
messing where it shouldn't um this is
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
one of those places where I think we're
 
04:54:46.948 --> 04:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
just going to rearrange the deck chairs
 
04:54:49.590 --> 04:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
on the Titanic and um it's still going
 
04:54:52.830 --> 04:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
to be sunk so uh I think interim study
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
is the best way out of here represent
 
04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you um I guess i'
 
04:55:00.910 --> 04:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
start off by saying um I would
 
04:55:02.708 --> 04:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with the people
 
04:55:05.868 --> 04:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
who may be talk to you um about the fact
 
04:55:09.750 --> 04:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
that the uh uh SAC functioned well
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
before CO as a member of the committee
 
04:55:15.390 --> 04:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
at that point I did not see that um and
 
04:55:22.110 --> 04:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
secondly in terms of um us um um dealing
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
with the membership um and the LBA audit
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:55:30.990 --> 04:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
LBA uh audit will provide
 
04:55:34.270 --> 04:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations I have no indication
 
04:55:36.430 --> 04:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
that they are going to revise or
 
04:55:38.708 --> 04:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
recommend revision of who the members
 
04:55:40.270 --> 04:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
are of the committee I think that would
 
04:55:40.280 --> 04:55:41.430 align:start position:0%
are of the committee I think that would
be

04:55:41.430 --> 04:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:55:47.030 --> 04:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
unusual um but uh so you know waiting
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
until an LBA audit comes out with some
 
04:55:52.510 --> 04:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations with which possibly
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
might have some thoughts on Who members
 
04:55:57.430 --> 04:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
should be or will they just say look at
 
04:56:01.628 --> 04:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
the federal guidelines um I I cannot
 
04:56:03.670 --> 04:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
support uh interal study at this point
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
and I will be supporting the amendment
 
04:56:08.310 --> 04:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
that has been put
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:20.190 --> 04:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
discussion I I do have uh did the audit
 
04:56:20.200 --> 04:56:22.548 align:start position:0%
discussion I I do have uh did the audit
requests

04:56:22.548 --> 04:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
requests
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
specifically address this issue of
 
04:56:26.910 --> 04:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
committee membership do you know
 
04:56:26.920 --> 04:56:28.708 align:start position:0%
committee membership do you know
represent

04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:56:32.070 --> 04:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
b or whomever may have been there
 
04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
because I do agree with represent uh
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli when I was on prior to
 
04:56:37.320 --> 04:56:38.470 align:start position:0%
cordelli when I was on prior to
representative

04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:42.150 --> 04:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
cordelli I didn't really get the feeling
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
the good touchy feeling that this was a
 
04:56:43.840 --> 04:56:47.628 align:start position:0%
the good touchy feeling that this was a
functional

04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
group um there is a meeting coming up in
 
04:56:52.548 --> 04:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
December that's going to get into more
 
04:56:55.110 --> 04:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
specifics about what was requested and
 
04:56:56.910 --> 04:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
what will come out of it at this time I
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't have that answer for
 
04:57:02.590 --> 04:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you the other
 
04:57:06.070 --> 04:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
question I had have shall any committee
 
04:57:10.270 --> 04:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
which is appointed have a lobbyist on
 
04:57:12.830 --> 04:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
it this this group has a lobbyist on
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
DRC no it's not on your Amendment I'm
 
04:57:27.868 --> 04:57:27.878 align:start position:0%
just asking it because it was on the
 
04:57:27.878 --> 04:57:28.910 align:start position:0%
just asking it because it was on the
original

04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
original
 
04:57:32.030 --> 04:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
bill and it's on the committee makeup
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
been there for a long time I I
 
04:57:40.110 --> 04:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
understand that things change
 
04:57:45.548 --> 04:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
too okay so yeah represent
 
04:57:48.788 --> 04:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
Hanner I think that they are not well
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of issues with the with
 
04:57:55.110 --> 04:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
the the uh the two committees the two
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
groups that they want to uh get rid of
 
04:58:00.430 --> 04:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
the piic and the D they this committee
 
04:58:03.708 --> 04:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
is supposed to look at um
 
04:58:05.708 --> 04:58:05.718 align:start position:0%
General what's happening in the state
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
not individual complaints but what are
 
04:58:10.350 --> 04:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
what are Trends in the state or what are
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
things that the Department of Education
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
should look at because it's it's
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
happening Statewide and these are the
 
04:58:20.670 --> 04:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
two groups that have that view from the
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
state state level now when you say
 
04:58:27.510 --> 04:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist it it's kind of like a a dirty
 
04:58:30.070 --> 04:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
word that you're throwing out there we
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
in this committee use lobbyist quite a
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
bit to give us information about
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
different things and this is what that
 
04:58:37.990 --> 04:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
person's job is is to get
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
information um they could send somebody
 
04:58:42.310 --> 04:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
else that doesn't have an orange badge I
 
04:58:44.788 --> 04:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
mean they're not like trying to get
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
profit off this group they're not trying
 
04:58:49.110 --> 04:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
to make profit off this group or trying
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
to get their particular um organization
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
a better position because of their
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
position on this group so I just want to
 
04:59:02.430 --> 04:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
throw that out there that the lobbyist
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
is not NE necessarily a dirty word to
 
04:59:09.670 --> 04:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
use and and uh that they've been there
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
for a long time and they've offered
 
04:59:15.510 --> 04:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
guidance and and help and information in
 
04:59:18.910 --> 04:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
the past and and uh you know what what
 
04:59:23.230 --> 04:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
do you said as um being functional uh in
 
04:59:24.990 --> 04:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
the past they've given recommendations
 
04:59:26.670 --> 04:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education that have
 
04:59:30.548 --> 04:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
then been brought here to legislative
 
04:59:34.830 --> 04:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
um uh oversight on it so so um I just
 
04:59:36.750 --> 04:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to pitch that in for the the
 
04:59:39.788 --> 04:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
lobest part and I I appreciate what
 
04:59:41.070 --> 04:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying I'll get to you a minute
 
04:59:43.628 --> 04:59:43.638 align:start position:0%
represent leus but when I'm looking at
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
the parent information
 
04:59:48.270 --> 04:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
center that's an organization which is
 
04:59:49.868 --> 04:59:49.878 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
04:59:54.070 --> 04:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
already if you look at 193 colon 34
 
04:59:56.750 --> 04:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to see it and that
 
04:59:59.590 --> 04:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
organization at that time was
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
established in 1981 and has a presence
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
in 49 States that's in our statute right
 
05:00:06.510 --> 05:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
now I don't know if it's been updated
 
05:00:09.628 --> 05:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
since uh that all occurred uh when I
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
looked it up on the web I saw
 
05:00:16.270 --> 05:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
establishments in Vermont and Maine I
 
05:00:17.788 --> 05:00:17.798 align:start position:0%
didn't see any establishments of that
 
05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
organization in the capture but you know
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
and my my concern is not with parent
 
05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
information center my concern is with
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
the other the DRC which they have
 
05:00:31.110 --> 05:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
somebody that's
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
paid and we don't put the news Hampshire
 
05:00:36.510 --> 05:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
school boards Association on a council
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
we don't put the superintendent
 
05:00:40.230 --> 05:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
Association on a council but that group
 
05:00:42.270 --> 05:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
does have an individual on this
 
05:00:42.280 --> 05:00:43.628 align:start position:0%
does have an individual on this
particular

05:00:43.628 --> 05:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:00:46.470 --> 05:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
group I wouldn't mind it if there was it
 
05:00:48.390 --> 05:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
was an organization which wasn't doing
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
that but there're actually there uh an
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
orange bads mean I'm lobbying for a
 
05:00:53.120 --> 05:00:54.548 align:start position:0%
orange bads mean I'm lobbying for a
particular

05:00:54.548 --> 05:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:00:57.070 --> 05:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
position and they're going to be on that
 
05:01:00.110 --> 05:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
group lobing for a particular position
 
05:01:02.708 --> 05:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
and so it it just doesn't ring true to
 
05:01:05.070 --> 05:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
me that that's what we want to have on a
 
05:01:05.080 --> 05:01:06.868 align:start position:0%
me that that's what we want to have on a
parent

05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
parent
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
organization so that that's that that's
 
05:01:12.030 --> 05:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
my concern right there and you know I
 
05:01:13.548 --> 05:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
have nothing against the orange badges
 
05:01:15.470 --> 05:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
we've used them many times over in fact
 
05:01:18.628 --> 05:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
we've seen manifest education written by
 
05:01:20.750 --> 05:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
that group well not this group but you
 
05:01:23.230 --> 05:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
know the school boards Association I i'
 
05:01:24.750 --> 05:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
I've worked with Mark Joyce and writing
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of stuff and the School
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
superintendants Association really fine
 
05:01:31.110 --> 05:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
people and I'm not saying that Karen are
 
05:01:33.670 --> 05:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
the persons there in in the DRC are are
 
05:01:37.350 --> 05:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
not that but they are lobbyists too and
 
05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
there is there's a line we got to draw
 
05:01:43.990 --> 05:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere so I I I feel strongly that
 
05:01:46.990 --> 05:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
we've got to modify this somehow but I'm
 
05:01:49.788 --> 05:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
also concerned right now and maybe a
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
little bit different than my my partner
 
05:01:53.628 --> 05:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
right beside me but I'm looking at six
 
05:01:55.510 --> 05:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
different amendments on this bill right
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
now the first one came back in represent
 
05:02:02.190 --> 05:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
Tanner the one I have your second uh
 
05:02:04.590 --> 05:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
because in January 30th Cordelia had one
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
and then you had one in January 31 and
 
05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
then we had another one in October 5 and
 
05:02:11.310 --> 05:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
then another one on October 26 and
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
another one here on the 13th of
 
05:02:18.150 --> 05:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
November Okay so we've had a we've
 
05:02:20.910 --> 05:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
struggled with this we've struggled with
 
05:02:24.430 --> 05:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and you know
 
05:02:27.510 --> 05:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
um and of all the things to go to the
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
house floor and have a hot debate over
 
05:02:31.548 --> 05:02:31.558 align:start position:0%
the structure of a committee or a
 
05:02:34.788 --> 05:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
commission to me is the height the
 
05:02:37.030 --> 05:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
Ridiculousness you know we we have other
 
05:02:38.750 --> 05:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
issues which we got to go fight on you
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
know like Charter School building Aid
 
05:02:42.190 --> 05:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
and mental health and all the other
 
05:02:44.110 --> 05:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
things which are important for our
 
05:02:47.830 --> 05:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
children not that this isn't but so I I
 
05:02:50.990 --> 05:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
you know I I I I I ask us to be cautious
 
05:02:53.830 --> 05:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
on this one right here and and try to
 
05:02:55.470 --> 05:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the best path for
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
that so with that I'm going to call a
 
05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
five minute
 
05:03:03.070 --> 05:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
caucus and for us to just you know
 
05:03:04.470 --> 05:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
scramble around a little bit with this
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
if we can and then come on
 
05:03:12.430 --> 05:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
back pardon me one more thing before we
 
05:03:16.270 --> 05:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
talk sure why not well I just want to
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
note that there was a lot of
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
conversation about including permission
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
to have a substitute and remote voting
 
05:03:24.510 --> 05:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
participation without requiring an
 
05:03:27.030 --> 05:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
in-person quorum to try and make
 
05:03:28.750 --> 05:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
participation easier in the logistics
 
05:03:30.868 --> 05:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
better and that's not in the proposed
 
05:03:32.430 --> 05:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and I think that's another
 
05:03:34.270 --> 05:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
topic pay attention to well refes Damon
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct because there
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
are states to allow the absent person to
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
appoint a substitute so you can have
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
your Corum that's required by Federal
 
05:03:45.670 --> 05:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
Regulation so that's just another twist
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
story okay so we're gonna have a caucus
 
05:03:55.310 --> 05:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
here tell you
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
A five minutes it's we don't want to
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
waste too much
 
05:04:03.990 --> 05:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
time I was going to say amendments we're
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
doing a good job of
 
05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.558 --> 05:14:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
emplo

05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
ahead now and pick it up uh we do have a
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%

05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
the are set categories of differentiated
 
05:20:52.150 --> 05:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
Aid and fund according with
 
05:20:55.868 --> 05:20:55.878 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid uh the child with a
 
05:20:59.110 --> 05:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
handicap that required a lot of time you
 
05:21:00.670 --> 05:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
know would be funded at a different
 
05:21:02.948 --> 05:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
level than a child who's in it for a
 
05:21:05.548 --> 05:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
shorter time to learn how to say
 
05:21:08.708 --> 05:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
R in speech especially when they're
 
05:21:10.350 --> 05:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
they're younger in a group of five or
 
05:21:12.750 --> 05:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
six kids trying that but then you have
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
also the category of special education
 
05:21:18.310 --> 05:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
Aid which is a category which has come
 
05:21:20.548 --> 05:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
out of small town and large town from
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
Republican town and Democrat towns that
 
05:21:28.030 --> 05:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
the the responsibility that we have to
 
05:21:31.150 --> 05:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
pay for special education due to the
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
idea individual disability Education
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
Act is such that we must provide these
 
05:21:41.910 --> 05:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
Services as stated in our state law and
 
05:21:44.110 --> 05:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
our especially the federal
 
05:21:46.750 --> 05:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
law and we were told by the feds
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
initially that they were going to fund
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
40% of this we know now that the funding
 
05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
level from the feds is probably down
 
05:21:56.350 --> 05:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
close to 16% so we're really not
 
05:21:57.548 --> 05:21:57.558 align:start position:0%
receiving from the federal government
 
05:21:59.590 --> 05:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
what we should so it means we have to
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate more money that difficult
 
05:22:04.310 --> 05:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
thing is that in many communities that
 
05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
I've experienced in my district small
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
towns receiving kids which are requiring
 
05:22:14.110 --> 05:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
intensive support through residential
 
05:22:16.830 --> 05:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
placement and even several years back
 
05:22:19.430 --> 05:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of these placements were
 
05:22:22.230 --> 05:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
$250,000 now it's gone higher than that
 
05:22:25.110 --> 05:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
even and for a small town to have two of
 
05:22:27.230 --> 05:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
these youngsters appearing in the same
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
year moving into town it's plain devast
 
05:22:33.350 --> 05:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
ating the small town does not have a
 
05:22:35.230 --> 05:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
trust fund or some other Reserve fund
 
05:22:37.628 --> 05:22:37.638 align:start position:0%
set up for this and so they have to come
 
05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
up with this money somehow the way they
 
05:22:41.350 --> 05:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
do it they have to go back to their
 
05:22:44.310 --> 05:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayer the property payer taxpayer or
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
they take it from other areas of their
 
05:22:49.708 --> 05:22:49.718 align:start position:0%
operating budget so to pay for Paul
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to you take from Mary over
 
05:22:54.750 --> 05:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
here and that that is you know to me is
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
is wrong I can remember one day this
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
past year sitting in the speaker's
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
office the speaker saying we don't have
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
enough money down in what London are for
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
this special education what are you
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to do about it well you know you
 
05:23:10.150 --> 05:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
got to pay the three and a half times
 
05:23:13.548 --> 05:23:13.558 align:start position:0%
first so if it's $20,000 it's $70,000
 
05:23:15.230 --> 05:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
you have to put up front first before
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to get the 80% paid by the
 
05:23:20.788 --> 05:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
state up to 10 times this bill takes it
 
05:23:23.390 --> 05:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
down to one and a half
 
05:23:26.590 --> 05:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
times I'm not saying it's wrong but I'm
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
saying that this is a huge expense and
 
05:23:33.548 --> 05:23:33.558 align:start position:0%
we don't know know and we've asked doe
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
on a number of times before I've
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
introduced legislation several years
 
05:23:38.670 --> 05:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
back that took it down to two and a half
 
05:23:40.990 --> 05:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
times Caitlyn couldn't provide me the
 
05:23:43.110 --> 05:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
information at that time what the costs
 
05:23:45.788 --> 05:23:45.798 align:start position:0%
would be and is that the answer I don't
 
05:23:48.430 --> 05:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
know I don't know are we getting audits
 
05:23:49.990 --> 05:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
done of these residential placement
 
05:23:51.868 --> 05:23:51.878 align:start position:0%
centers are are the costs which were
 
05:23:53.948 --> 05:23:53.958 align:start position:0%
being told we have to
 
05:23:57.070 --> 05:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
pay accurate what are going into these
 
05:23:59.548 --> 05:23:59.558 align:start position:0%
expenses I don't know we've seen kids
 
05:24:02.270 --> 05:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
placed in Tennessee and getting a crummy
 
05:24:05.230 --> 05:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
education by HHS and look what they're
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
going through they're going through hell
 
05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so I think this whole gamut needs a
 
05:24:14.430 --> 05:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
heavy heavy duty look and hopefully an
 
05:24:16.230 --> 05:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
inter room study might help us do that
 
05:24:18.030 --> 05:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
but I think it even needs more than that
 
05:24:20.830 --> 05:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
I think it needs a healthy commission
 
05:24:24.270 --> 05:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
study and I PL representative Heath for
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
putting a bill in this year to do just
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
that it's it's so important it's hurting
 
05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
every community in the state
 
05:24:34.230 --> 05:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
and herting kids so please support the
 
05:24:37.510 --> 05:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
interim motion study
 
05:24:40.030 --> 05:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
motion any further
 
05:24:43.310 --> 05:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
comments yes represent Miler yeah not
 
05:24:43.320 --> 05:24:44.150 align:start position:0%
comments yes represent Miler yeah not
not

05:24:44.150 --> 05:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:24:47.190 --> 05:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
withstanding what chair lad has said I
 
05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
think it's important for this committee
 
05:24:53.070 --> 05:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
to make a policy statement here uh uh
 
05:24:54.590 --> 05:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative Heath has a bill in
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
that's going to provide a deep hopefully
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
will get past a deep study but I think
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's important for this committee to go
 
05:25:03.470 --> 05:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
on record and say to basically
 
05:25:06.270 --> 05:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledge what the chair has just said
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't see a a problem at this
 
05:25:10.670 --> 05:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
point in time where this committee say
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
no you're right there needs to be more
 
05:25:15.510 --> 05:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
state state support for special
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
education students
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
period and then let the commission the
 
05:25:21.510 --> 05:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
commission then says oh this is where
 
05:25:23.548 --> 05:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
the commi this is where the education
 
05:25:25.230 --> 05:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
committee is that's an important
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
statement let the commission then say
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
take that policy statement forward and
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
do something with it
 
05:25:33.390 --> 05:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
so I think that just to interm study
 
05:25:36.430 --> 05:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
this at this point in time pending the
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
bills that's coming forward I think
 
05:25:40.750 --> 05:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
would be a mistake uh because I think we
 
05:25:43.510 --> 05:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
need to stay step forward and say now is
 
05:25:46.708 --> 05:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
the time let's do something commission
 
05:25:50.430 --> 05:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do it sponsored lab and
 
05:25:56.070 --> 05:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.470 --> 05:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
you Reon
 
05:26:01.990 --> 05:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you
 
05:26:03.470 --> 05:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Miler for
 
05:26:05.470 --> 05:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
framing this in the way that you just
 
05:26:08.390 --> 05:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
did I'm a co-sponsor on this bill
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's no District that wouldn't
 
05:26:12.310 --> 05:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
benefit from more State funding for
 
05:26:14.708 --> 05:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
special education I don't have any
 
05:26:17.788 --> 05:26:17.798 align:start position:0%
illusion that us potentially approving
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
this OTP today is actually going to get
 
05:26:22.190 --> 05:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
more special education money to
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
districts next year it's going to go to
 
05:26:26.150 --> 05:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
finance and we can read the handwriting
 
05:26:29.110 --> 05:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
on the wall but as a statement that we
 
05:26:31.750 --> 05:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
as an education committee
 
05:26:34.310 --> 05:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
see urgency to addressing special
 
05:26:34.320 --> 05:26:35.590 align:start position:0%
see urgency to addressing special
education

05:26:35.590 --> 05:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:26:37.868 --> 05:26:37.878 align:start position:0%
funding I don't understand why anyone
 
05:26:41.190 --> 05:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support this thank you Reon
 
05:26:43.548 --> 05:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank
 
05:26:49.310 --> 05:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
you but if this bill were to pass as it
 
05:26:52.788 --> 05:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
is and finance says um you've you've got
 
05:26:55.270 --> 05:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
your money it's in the budget you know
 
05:26:59.590 --> 05:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
be happy with that what happens is that
 
05:27:02.230 --> 05:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
the number of students who are eligible
 
05:27:05.590 --> 05:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
for this Aid is dramatically increased
 
05:27:07.948 --> 05:27:07.958 align:start position:0%
so all those students are going to get
 
05:27:09.548 --> 05:27:09.558 align:start position:0%
less all those districts are going to
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
get less money for those students
 
05:27:14.670 --> 05:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
because there are many more students and
 
05:27:16.590 --> 05:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
there less and the appropriation isn't
 
05:27:19.628 --> 05:27:19.638 align:start position:0%
changed so you're harming all those
 
05:27:25.030 --> 05:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:26.910 --> 05:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation further discussion
 
05:27:29.110 --> 05:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative beler thank you Mr chair
 
05:27:30.590 --> 05:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
I would just add that going back to to
 
05:27:32.070 --> 05:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
our original conversation we had a long
 
05:27:34.708 --> 05:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
time ago on this bill I think if we're
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to look at a sort of catastrophic
 
05:27:40.948 --> 05:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
back stop for uh towns in this situation
 
05:27:42.628 --> 05:27:42.638 align:start position:0%
which I think is wholly appropriate by
 
05:27:45.070 --> 05:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
the way I think the way to deal with it
 
05:27:49.110 --> 05:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
is not to broaden the pool of students
 
05:27:52.350 --> 05:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
who qualify and keep at an 80% rate but
 
05:27:54.670 --> 05:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
to narrow the range of students who
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
would qualify and cover the cost at a
 
05:27:58.230 --> 05:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
higher rate by the state I think that
 
05:27:59.548 --> 05:27:59.558 align:start position:0%
would be a more appropriate way to go
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:04.628 --> 05:28:04.638 align:start position:0%

money to districts I think that it is a
 
05:28:28.190 --> 05:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.030 --> 05:28:32.040 align:start position:0%

please okay we have a motion made by
 
05:29:39.230 --> 05:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner second by
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:48.830 --> 05:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
577 representa
 
05:29:51.948 --> 05:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
Tanner um as representative Damon said I
 
05:29:53.788 --> 05:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a school a public
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
school in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:29:58.708 --> 05:29:58.718 align:start position:0%
that uh wouldn't support this bill um
 
05:30:01.510 --> 05:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
people School boards administrators
 
05:30:04.470 --> 05:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
teachers uh parents and that I don't
 
05:30:06.190 --> 05:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
think uh the solution
 
05:30:10.230 --> 05:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
is telling parents of students who now
 
05:30:12.510 --> 05:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
qualify for Disabilities that they no
 
05:30:15.270 --> 05:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
longer qualify for Disabilities and and
 
05:30:17.150 --> 05:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
make the number smaller so we can
 
05:30:19.948 --> 05:30:19.958 align:start position:0%
support it more I think we need to step
 
05:30:23.548 --> 05:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
up and fund special education and I need
 
05:30:25.230 --> 05:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
think the federal government needs to
 
05:30:27.670 --> 05:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
step up and fund federal education or
 
05:30:27.680 --> 05:30:29.230 align:start position:0%
step up and fund federal education or
special

05:30:29.230 --> 05:30:29.240 align:start position:0%

classify more urgent cases of
 
05:32:09.430 --> 05:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
special I put a feel on that just last
 
05:32:11.948 --> 05:32:11.958 align:start position:0%
year categorizing at different levels
 
05:32:14.430 --> 05:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
and they was rejected Finance I got to
 
05:32:14.440 --> 05:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
and they was rejected Finance I got to
go

05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:31.948 --> 05:32:31.958 align:start position:0%
there experience in this sort of thing
 
05:32:35.390 --> 05:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you structure school
 
05:32:38.510 --> 05:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
system so don't do a pile on when the
 
05:32:42.350 --> 05:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
door opens justly I is it by limiting
 
05:32:42.360 --> 05:32:45.750 align:start position:0%
door opens justly I is it by limiting
how

05:32:45.750 --> 05:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:53.868 --> 05:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:57.230 --> 05:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
get well I think I think you know just
 
05:32:59.430 --> 05:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
like I always say that the schools are
 
05:32:59.440 --> 05:33:04.708 align:start position:0%
like I always say that the schools are
under

05:33:04.708 --> 05:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:04.718 --> 05:33:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
all

05:33:07.590 --> 05:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:11.470 --> 05:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
the unfunded land I mean I totally agree
 
05:33:14.430 --> 05:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
with all that and so you have this build
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:26.750 --> 05:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
school I mean when you look at back at
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
you look at the money that the
 
05:33:32.030 --> 05:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
government our school taxes went
 
05:33:35.310 --> 05:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
down simply because they had
 
05:33:38.270 --> 05:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
discretionary money to meets that built
 
05:33:39.910 --> 05:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
up for a long period of time whether it
 
05:33:42.350 --> 05:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
was building needs or whether it was
 
05:33:44.830 --> 05:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
special paying off special ed costs or
 
05:33:46.990 --> 05:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
whatever I've been working with my wife
 
05:33:48.750 --> 05:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of the stuff going around
 
05:33:51.510 --> 05:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
this St so I'm getting more and more
 
05:33:54.150 --> 05:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with different schools on
 
05:33:55.990 --> 05:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
finding that
 
05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
super very
 
05:34:08.430 --> 05:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:12.910 --> 05:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
super in the state and some of I mean
 
05:34:14.310 --> 05:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
because it's a
 
05:34:14.320 --> 05:34:28.868 align:start position:0%
because it's a
job

05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:28.878 --> 05:40:04.230 align:start position:0%

05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
2317 okay so rep and Cordell reckman OTP
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
a or a on this uh Amendment
 
05:42:43.200 --> 05:42:50.510 align:start position:0%
a or a on this uh Amendment
2317

05:42:50.510 --> 05:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:58.080 --> 05:43:04.110 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:43:04.110 --> 05:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:05.510 --> 05:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
represent Corell you want to speak to
 
05:43:11.110 --> 05:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
your motion thank you uh yes um uh I
 
05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
think with the original bill um we had a
 
05:43:16.150 --> 05:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
long discussion about that and uh a
 
05:43:18.468 --> 05:43:18.478 align:start position:0%
number of people saw issues with the
 
05:43:23.150 --> 05:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
original language uh so uh this uh
 
05:43:25.310 --> 05:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment hopefully clarifies the
 
05:43:28.390 --> 05:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
language and you see the new language on
 
05:43:30.310 --> 05:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
Line's 20 through
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
26 um uh this was arrived at um between
 
05:43:39.070 --> 05:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
the uh um the sponsor of the amendment
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
and the Department of
 
05:43:44.948 --> 05:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
Education um basically um it says that
 
05:43:46.750 --> 05:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:43:49.510 --> 05:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent of a school or the chief
 
05:43:53.110 --> 05:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
executive officer uh can
 
05:43:58.830 --> 05:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
um try and um work with the uh unions to
 
05:44:01.830 --> 05:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh open up for additional criminal
 
05:44:05.628 --> 05:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
background checks on a recurring basis
 
05:44:08.190 --> 05:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
um after the initial employment
 
05:44:10.510 --> 05:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
background check and I think that's uh
 
05:44:14.230 --> 05:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
the key that um we have many people um
 
05:44:17.150 --> 05:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
in the field who um have not had
 
05:44:20.310 --> 05:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
background checks um for years because
 
05:44:25.628 --> 05:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
of um the uh their length of service and
 
05:44:27.868 --> 05:44:27.878 align:start position:0%
when um additional background check
 
05:44:29.830 --> 05:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
language has been added to the statutes
 
05:44:32.230 --> 05:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
over the past few years um so I think
 
05:44:37.590 --> 05:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
that this um plugs a hole in the process
 
05:44:41.830 --> 05:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
to um um we had discussion earlier today
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
about background checks and the
 
05:44:44.910 --> 05:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
importance well I think this plugs a
 
05:44:48.830 --> 05:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
whole in public school background
 
05:44:52.190 --> 05:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
checks as the the second the catch
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
wordss for me which uh I support on line
 
05:44:57.868 --> 05:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
the last word in line
 
05:45:01.750 --> 05:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
21 superintendent May negotiate so this
 
05:45:03.708 --> 05:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
is up to the individual superintendent
 
05:45:06.468 --> 05:45:06.478 align:start position:0%
and that receiving Association to decide
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to go this
 
05:45:13.310 --> 05:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:15.548 --> 05:45:15.558 align:start position:0%
thing represent
 
05:45:18.390 --> 05:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
M yeah I don't think this language is
 
05:45:21.230 --> 05:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
necessary this came from uh one
 
05:45:25.030 --> 05:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
particular School District uh this is
 
05:45:27.350 --> 05:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
permissible language anyway currently in
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
in collective bargaining and if if a
 
05:45:31.670 --> 05:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent wanted to pursue this
 
05:45:34.430 --> 05:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
they could put this on the table uh and
 
05:45:36.430 --> 05:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
I just don't I don't think this is
 
05:45:38.670 --> 05:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
necessary we typically in this committee
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
do not take something that's from one
 
05:45:44.030 --> 05:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
particular individual uh he cited a
 
05:45:47.110 --> 05:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
concern that he had and he could be able
 
05:45:48.750 --> 05:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
and he can put this on the table at any
 
05:45:51.030 --> 05:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
time when they negotiate this language
 
05:45:54.230 --> 05:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
is not necessary at this point in time
 
05:45:54.240 --> 05:45:57.548 align:start position:0%
is not necessary at this point in time
further

05:45:57.548 --> 05:45:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:59.830 --> 05:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
discussion okay
 
05:46:02.030 --> 05:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
represent Celli yes just to follow up on
 
05:46:04.788 --> 05:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
that um I did follow up with that
 
05:46:09.110 --> 05:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
superintendent um recently um and uh he
 
05:46:11.350 --> 05:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
did try and put it on the table with the
 
05:46:14.310 --> 05:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
Union but was told uh there's nothing in
 
05:46:17.510 --> 05:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
statute um about doing something like
 
05:46:19.990 --> 05:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
that so I think that's why we need to
 
05:46:22.030 --> 05:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
put this in
 
05:46:25.230 --> 05:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
statute report for that yes um if you've
 
05:46:26.868 --> 05:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
been involved in collective bargaining
 
05:46:29.390 --> 05:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
as I have there's always anything can be
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
put on the table as long as both parties
 
05:46:34.430 --> 05:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
have something to give or something to
 
05:46:37.590 --> 05:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
take so obviously in that this the
 
05:46:39.628 --> 05:46:39.638 align:start position:0%
situation you're in there was nothing to
 
05:46:41.948 --> 05:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
give on the part of the administration
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:48.190 --> 05:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
wanted further discussion representative
 
05:46:49.990 --> 05:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
Tanner and then representa
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
Heath just um because this is a contract
 
05:46:56.830 --> 05:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
negotiation uh that that covers this
 
05:46:58.190 --> 05:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people that work in
 
05:47:00.670 --> 05:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
schools that are employed who are not
 
05:47:04.350 --> 05:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
under the contract and therefore um it
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
really is picking out a specific group
 
05:47:11.110 --> 05:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
of people and and putting onus on
 
05:47:14.590 --> 05:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
them represent Heath quick question how
 
05:47:16.590 --> 05:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
would you keep this from becoming
 
05:47:26.070 --> 05:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
capricious is there somebody wants to
 
05:47:33.030 --> 05:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:35.510 --> 05:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the question please how
 
05:47:38.350 --> 05:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
would you prevent this bill from
 
05:47:41.510 --> 05:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
becoming arbitrary or capricious um for
 
05:47:44.670 --> 05:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
example if there was a dispute between a
 
05:47:47.468 --> 05:47:47.478 align:start position:0%
teacher and an administrator um that
 
05:47:49.628 --> 05:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
they could use this um kind of as a
 
05:47:51.708 --> 05:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
vehicle because I don't like you I'm
 
05:47:57.628 --> 05:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:57.638 --> 05:48:01.868 align:start position:0%
 
again

05:48:01.868 --> 05:48:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:04.468 --> 05:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
anybody yes represent belon yes I think
 
05:48:05.830 --> 05:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
I can answer that with with the fact
 
05:48:06.990 --> 05:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
that because this is enabling
 
05:48:08.590 --> 05:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that enables collective
 
05:48:10.270 --> 05:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
bargaining on this basis that would be
 
05:48:11.670 --> 05:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
the issue of the collective bargaining
 
05:48:15.070 --> 05:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
agreement and I couldn't possibly see a
 
05:48:19.270 --> 05:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh Union being um lacking the foresight
 
05:48:22.270 --> 05:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
to not craft this negotiation and policy
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
in such a way as to prohibit the
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
individual targeting of teachers based
 
05:48:31.070 --> 05:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:31.080 --> 05:48:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
further

05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%

05:54:07.310 --> 05:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
Noble thank you Mr
 
05:54:10.948 --> 05:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
chair so I went back and watched a lot
 
05:54:13.590 --> 05:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
of our we had a lot of work sessions on
 
05:54:16.030 --> 05:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
mental health and I watch some of the
 
05:54:18.390 --> 05:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
hearings and it's clear we have a
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
significant issue with mental health and
 
05:54:23.910 --> 05:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health in our
 
05:54:28.070 --> 05:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
schools in our June um work session
 
05:54:30.830 --> 05:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative luno um asked what I
 
05:54:34.750 --> 05:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
think are two very important
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
questions um one is what are the factors
 
05:54:41.590 --> 05:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
that contribute to this EP epidemic and
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
is this partially an epidemic of our
 
05:54:48.030 --> 05:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
making so I think for the sake of
 
05:54:51.590 --> 05:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
students and teachers um we need to have
 
05:54:53.310 --> 05:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of what's going
 
05:54:56.350 --> 05:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
on in our schools and and see if we can
 
05:54:59.150 --> 05:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
do something to help a devate the
 
05:55:02.190 --> 05:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
problem so you know we're talking about
 
05:55:05.270 --> 05:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
the mental health of children here so we
 
05:55:06.868 --> 05:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
need to tread
 
05:55:09.670 --> 05:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
lightly and I I don't think we should
 
05:55:11.468 --> 05:55:11.478 align:start position:0%
make any changes to mental health
 
05:55:13.548 --> 05:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
curriculum or anything having to do with
 
05:55:16.468 --> 05:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
mental health until we have some answers
 
05:55:20.910 --> 05:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:24.590 --> 05:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
problem thank you uh represent Celli uh
 
05:55:28.510 --> 05:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes you know it's one thing
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
to teach someone about mental health but
 
05:55:35.390 --> 05:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
let's let's find the causes and trying
 
05:55:38.670 --> 05:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
to address the causes of the problems um
 
05:55:41.070 --> 05:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
that students are seeing clearly
 
05:55:44.110 --> 05:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
bullying is one of them anxiety
 
05:55:46.670 --> 05:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
depression um and we'll be talking about
 
05:55:48.270 --> 05:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
some of the causes of anxiety and
 
05:55:51.948 --> 05:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
depression in a few minutes but um two
 
05:55:55.430 --> 05:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
weeks ago I even found an a study study
 
05:55:58.670 --> 05:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
claims humans having sex with a extinct
 
05:56:01.468 --> 05:56:01.478 align:start position:0%
species 60,000 years ago could be why
 
05:56:05.468 --> 05:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
you suffer from mental issues so um I'm
 
05:56:07.948 --> 05:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
not sure if we know the causes but I
 
05:56:09.788 --> 05:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
think that with interim study we
 
05:56:11.830 --> 05:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
certainly can start to address some of
 
05:56:14.190 --> 05:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
the ones that are known and try and
 
05:56:16.868 --> 05:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
resolve um those issues for our students
 
05:56:20.310 --> 05:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
rather than teaching them um about um
 
05:56:20.320 --> 05:56:21.948 align:start position:0%
rather than teaching them um about um
mental

05:56:21.948 --> 05:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
mental
 
05:56:26.190 --> 05:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:30.270 --> 05:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:33.788 --> 05:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
EXC okay no further discussion the chair
 
05:56:36.468 --> 05:56:36.478 align:start position:0%
can we get the source of that
 
05:56:36.478 --> 05:56:37.990 align:start position:0%
can we get the source of that
study

05:56:37.990 --> 05:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:56:42.628 --> 05:56:42.638 align:start position:0%

05:56:48.750 --> 05:56:48.760 align:start position:0%

05:56:54.948 --> 05:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
discussion M yes representative Balon uh
 
05:56:58.030 --> 05:56:58.040 align:start position:0%

05:57:00.788 --> 05:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
what I recall that uh representative
 
05:57:04.590 --> 05:57:04.600 align:start position:0%
Damon was asked to just uh change that
 
05:57:09.468 --> 05:57:09.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:12.350 --> 05:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
confused re Damon thank you and thank
 
05:57:16.070 --> 05:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Boni um so I hadn't
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
spoken to the motion for interim study
 
05:57:21.110 --> 05:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
but there is an amendment that everyone
 
05:57:23.750 --> 05:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
should have that simply remove the word
 
05:57:25.788 --> 05:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
comprehensive from the three places that
 
05:57:28.150 --> 05:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
occurs in the bill I'm sorry and all
 
05:57:29.750 --> 05:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
this paperwork I can't find my copy so I
 
05:57:31.548 --> 05:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
can't tell you the amendment number does
 
05:57:35.548 --> 05:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
somebody have it it is uh 2316 2361
 
05:57:38.190 --> 05:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
right which used to be my phone number
 
05:57:41.190 --> 05:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
um um this
 
05:57:44.708 --> 05:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
isn't so OS didn't
 
05:57:47.070 --> 05:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
send this is not the correct Amendment
 
05:57:48.590 --> 05:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
this is someone else's amendment that
 
05:57:50.190 --> 05:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
they've attributed to
 
05:57:53.110 --> 05:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
me sorry I didn't look at it carefully
 
05:57:55.230 --> 05:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
this morning when I picked it
 
05:57:58.628 --> 05:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
up um
 
05:58:01.430 --> 05:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't I apologize I don't know how
 
05:58:05.390 --> 05:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
to proceed because this is
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
not I don't think this
 
05:58:07.798 --> 05:58:10.150 align:start position:0%
not I don't think this
is

05:58:10.150 --> 05:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:58:12.788 --> 05:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
yeah right now this this motion this
 
05:58:14.948 --> 05:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
interim study because it said
 
05:58:17.510 --> 05:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
comprehens yeah so we should go to that
 
05:58:17.520 --> 05:58:19.270 align:start position:0%
comprehens yeah so we should go to that
later

05:58:19.270 --> 05:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
later
 
05:58:22.350 --> 05:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
so relative to interim
 
05:58:25.628 --> 05:58:25.638 align:start position:0%
study there is a overwhelming abundance
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
of knowledge about causes of of the
 
05:58:31.310 --> 05:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
increase in mental health conditions in
 
05:58:33.270 --> 05:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
people of all ages and most especially
 
05:58:35.990 --> 05:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
students it's it's not unknown or hard
 
05:58:37.948 --> 05:58:37.958 align:start position:0%
to find I don't think
 
05:58:41.150 --> 05:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
delaying putting mental health education
 
05:58:41.160 --> 05:58:42.150 align:start position:0%
delaying putting mental health education
into

05:58:42.150 --> 05:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:58:44.910 --> 05:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum to study that causes more
 
05:58:44.920 --> 05:58:49.150 align:start position:0%
curriculum to study that causes more
accomplishes

05:58:49.150 --> 05:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:52.110 --> 05:58:52.120 align:start position:0%

so thank you for helping me with the
 
06:00:27.200 --> 06:00:29.390 align:start position:0%
so thank you for helping me with the
process

06:00:29.390 --> 06:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:00:32.708 --> 06:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
so I am in support of this bill um I
 
06:00:34.990 --> 06:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
think it is a very
 
06:00:35.000 --> 06:00:36.628 align:start position:0%
think it is a very
important

06:00:36.628 --> 06:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:00:39.230 --> 06:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
part of how we should be educating
 
06:00:42.070 --> 06:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
people to thrive that they understand
 
06:00:44.468 --> 06:00:44.478 align:start position:0%
basic aspects of mental
 
06:00:47.310 --> 06:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
health the amendment that I've proposed
 
06:00:50.350 --> 06:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
to 361 simply removes the word
 
06:00:53.190 --> 06:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive from the three places that
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
it had occurred in the bill in the title
 
06:00:59.310 --> 06:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
and in the text so it is
 
06:01:02.150 --> 06:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
not as uncertain we had a lot of
 
06:01:03.670 --> 06:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
discussion about what does comprehensive
 
06:01:05.868 --> 06:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
mean we don't Define everything else
 
06:01:08.110 --> 06:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
that specifically so that Amendment just
 
06:01:10.670 --> 06:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
makes it a little bit more at the
 
06:01:12.990 --> 06:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
discretion of the Local District as we
 
06:01:19.430 --> 06:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:23.150 --> 06:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
control okay do you want to speak to the
 
06:01:23.160 --> 06:01:25.708 align:start position:0%
control okay do you want to speak to the
um

06:01:25.708 --> 06:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:32.510 --> 06:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:36.548 --> 06:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
amendment now yes represent
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
leus aren't we doing this
 
06:01:41.708 --> 06:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
already pardon me aren't we doing this
 
06:01:43.670 --> 06:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
already I mean we even have the health
 
06:01:46.350 --> 06:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
education curriculum guidelines and
 
06:01:48.830 --> 06:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
everything I'm still not sure why we
 
06:01:51.590 --> 06:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
need to put it in when we're doing
 
06:01:55.948 --> 06:01:55.958 align:start position:0%
it I wasn't on that subcommittee
 
06:01:58.150 --> 06:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
sorry I've been involved with that
 
06:02:01.030 --> 06:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I recognize we do have
 
06:02:03.150 --> 06:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
mental health issues in our school and
 
06:02:05.868 --> 06:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
it's uh an issue that's
 
06:02:08.948 --> 06:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
Statewide um I've been an advocate for
 
06:02:11.270 --> 06:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
putting mental health into this however
 
06:02:12.750 --> 06:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
where I am right
 
06:02:14.750 --> 06:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
now is
 
06:02:19.270 --> 06:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
that we do have it in our Ed 306
 
06:02:23.910 --> 06:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
rules we do have it in our Frameworks
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
which addresses Mental
 
06:02:31.910 --> 06:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
Health we do know that within 193e that
 
06:02:34.910 --> 06:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
we do have the substantive criteria for
 
06:02:37.510 --> 06:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
an adequate education which health and
 
06:02:41.270 --> 06:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
wellness are that and we also have
 
06:02:44.190 --> 06:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
within that same area statute that
 
06:02:46.270 --> 06:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
nothing can be changed by
 
06:02:48.948 --> 06:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
rule unless it's gone through to change
 
06:02:52.150 --> 06:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
those subst criteria areas unless it's
 
06:02:53.628 --> 06:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
done by the general
 
06:02:57.910 --> 06:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
court we also have in 193 J and two
 
06:02:59.990 --> 06:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
which deals with suicide
 
06:03:03.390 --> 06:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
prevention but also mental health as
 
06:03:06.468 --> 06:03:06.478 align:start position:0%
says um Training School faculty and
 
06:03:08.430 --> 06:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
staff including contracted personnel and
 
06:03:10.310 --> 06:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
designated School volunteers and youth
 
06:03:13.670 --> 06:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
suicide risk fa factors warnings Etc and
 
06:03:15.628 --> 06:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
it goes on and says educating students
 
06:03:16.990 --> 06:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
the importance of safe and healthy
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
choices and coping strategies
 
06:03:21.110 --> 06:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
recognizing risk factors and warning
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
signs of mental
 
06:03:26.430 --> 06:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
disorders and suicide in it in oneself
 
06:03:28.190 --> 06:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
and others and writing helpy seeking
 
06:03:29.628 --> 06:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
strategies for oneself or others
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
including how to engage School resources
 
06:03:34.310 --> 06:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
and refer friends for help we've done
 
06:03:35.788 --> 06:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
this through
 
06:03:38.670 --> 06:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
mtssb we have a program with three steps
 
06:03:41.628 --> 06:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
in the schools that exists right
 
06:03:43.788 --> 06:03:43.798 align:start position:0%
now and I'm not going through the three
 
06:03:45.468 --> 06:03:45.478 align:start position:0%
steps I think we all know them you know
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
the classroom teacher teacher at risks
 
06:03:50.350 --> 06:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
and then those and those really engaging
 
06:03:52.830 --> 06:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
in intervention it's the third
 
06:03:56.750 --> 06:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
step with this process going on I've
 
06:03:58.948 --> 06:03:58.958 align:start position:0%
thought a lot about this and I'm trying
 
06:04:02.390 --> 06:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
to find out where is this red line
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
between behaviors which are totally
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
unacceptable maybe more behavioral like
 
06:04:10.150 --> 06:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
I said
 
06:04:13.070 --> 06:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
behaviors and where does mental health
 
06:04:15.868 --> 06:04:15.878 align:start position:0%
start and what has pushed me the other
 
06:04:19.548 --> 06:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
way is what I had a discussion with my
 
06:04:24.628 --> 06:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
daughter who is a life skills teacher at
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
a middle
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
school and a student put his fist right
 
06:04:33.350 --> 06:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
through the sheetrock in the wall and
 
06:04:35.628 --> 06:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
started screaming and yelling and having
 
06:04:38.430 --> 06:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
heck of a time he of course had to be
 
06:04:40.468 --> 06:04:40.478 align:start position:0%
removed but to remove from a classroom
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
it takes how much time good five minutes
 
06:04:45.548 --> 06:04:45.558 align:start position:0%
10 minutes disruption of time this is
 
06:04:48.070 --> 06:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
what's happening in schools and when you
 
06:04:50.270 --> 06:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
take the amount of time that's these
 
06:04:50.280 --> 06:04:51.628 align:start position:0%
take the amount of time that's these
disruptions

06:04:51.628 --> 06:04:51.638 align:start position:0%
disruptions
 
06:04:54.788 --> 06:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
occurring you have lost probably as much
 
06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
as 10% to even more 20% % of
 
06:05:00.030 --> 06:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
instructional time in a given year it's
 
06:05:02.390 --> 06:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
lost and we ask why are we not doing
 
06:05:04.430 --> 06:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
well in school well obviously you know
 
06:05:06.270 --> 06:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
the instructional time's been cut back
 
06:05:08.510 --> 06:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
but taking the story a little farther
 
06:05:10.948 --> 06:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
what happened is the student was
 
06:05:13.788 --> 06:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
removed and my daughter whose teacher
 
06:05:16.590 --> 06:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
suggest we need just get hold of mom and
 
06:05:19.390 --> 06:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
dad or parent and have the kid taken
 
06:05:22.510 --> 06:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
home parent came first thing the parent
 
06:05:24.670 --> 06:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
says get in the car I'll take you to
 
06:05:24.680 --> 06:05:26.070 align:start position:0%
says get in the car I'll take you to
Dunkin

06:05:26.070 --> 06:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
Dunkin
 
06:05:28.948 --> 06:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
Donuts well that's just not that's going
 
06:05:32.030 --> 06:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
to reinforce negative
 
06:05:34.590 --> 06:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
behaviors then when it was stated out
 
06:05:37.390 --> 06:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
loud that we need because the child is
 
06:05:39.990 --> 06:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
now fighting really hard we need to call
 
06:05:43.030 --> 06:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
the police child settled down and got
 
06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
into the car next day that child's back
 
06:05:47.670 --> 06:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:05:50.430 --> 06:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
classroom uh it comes to a point where
 
06:05:53.190 --> 06:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
is behavior separated from mental health
 
06:05:55.628 --> 06:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
where is that red line where is the
 
06:05:58.270 --> 06:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
difference I'm not an expert on it I
 
06:06:00.390 --> 06:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
know reps and cascaden you've dealt with
 
06:06:01.830 --> 06:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
this with your programs as a
 
06:06:03.948 --> 06:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
superintendent as a individual working
 
06:06:06.310 --> 06:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
in the schools and I know a lot of
 
06:06:07.830 --> 06:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
schools have these programs I won't
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
mention that that the program this
 
06:06:11.110 --> 06:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
school has in place but they have this
 
06:06:14.110 --> 06:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
program in place and several other
 
06:06:16.590 --> 06:06:16.600 align:start position:0%
programs the behaviors
 
06:06:20.430 --> 06:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
continue are these behaviors behaviors
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
or are they mental health
 
06:06:24.788 --> 06:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
disorders I I see other health
 
06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
impairment that's one of our criteria
 
06:06:29.910 --> 06:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
for IEPs 13 one of 13 that's increasing
 
06:06:29.920 --> 06:06:30.868 align:start position:0%
for IEPs 13 one of 13 that's increasing
in

06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:06:35.350 --> 06:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
numbers so I guess that I'm I'm a little
 
06:06:38.350 --> 06:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
bit confused as to is this something
 
06:06:39.990 --> 06:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's an environmental issue coming in
 
06:06:41.990 --> 06:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
from the home a behavior that coming off
 
06:06:43.468 --> 06:06:43.478 align:start position:0%
the streets or a behavior it's a
 
06:06:47.270 --> 06:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
resultant of kids being attacked on the
 
06:06:50.230 --> 06:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
internet with anxiety and sexually
 
06:06:51.830 --> 06:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
driven materials they're coming to
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
school they're not interested in what's
 
06:06:54.830 --> 06:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
academic they can't they're on this
 
06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
other task so I I think that this issue
 
06:07:02.430 --> 06:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
is much larger than what we know here in
 
06:07:04.628 --> 06:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
this group right here and it really does
 
06:07:07.390 --> 06:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
needs a whole lot of study and and a
 
06:07:10.350 --> 06:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
proper re answer on it and unfortunately
 
06:07:12.350 --> 06:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's
 
06:07:15.110 --> 06:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
societal and you know I'm not giving up
 
06:07:18.548 --> 06:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
on it but I do believe that
 
06:07:21.510 --> 06:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's uh just by putting
 
06:07:23.310 --> 06:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
it into statute say well now we got
 
06:07:24.390 --> 06:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
mental health there we're going to
 
06:07:26.190 --> 06:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
resolve it I don't think we've already
 
06:07:28.830 --> 06:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
been dealing with it and so we need to
 
06:07:30.310 --> 06:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
take more action just putting more
 
06:07:35.030 --> 06:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:37.590 --> 06:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
you further
 
06:07:40.708 --> 06:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
discussion represent penell yes thank
 
06:07:43.468 --> 06:07:43.478 align:start position:0%
you um I justess my biggest concern with
 
06:07:45.670 --> 06:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation although we all are
 
06:07:47.190 --> 06:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
aware that mental health is a
 
06:07:49.708 --> 06:07:49.718 align:start position:0%
significant concern is that mental
 
06:07:51.430 --> 06:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
health is included in the definition of
 
06:07:52.948 --> 06:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
health education so I find this
 
06:07:55.830 --> 06:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:55.840 --> 06:07:57.708 align:start position:0%
 
redundant

06:07:57.708 --> 06:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
06:07:59.948 --> 06:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
yep that's something I alluded to that
 
06:08:01.910 --> 06:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have it in the Frameworks we have it
 
06:08:03.190 --> 06:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
in Ed
 
06:08:06.190 --> 06:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
306 and we have it spoken in other areas
 
06:08:08.310 --> 06:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
of legislation as well and it is part of
 
06:08:09.430 --> 06:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
Health and
 
06:08:12.910 --> 06:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
Wellness so you know the thing we start
 
06:08:14.548 --> 06:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
walking down the road and i' G give it a
 
06:08:16.150 --> 06:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
lot of thought do we take all the
 
06:08:18.150 --> 06:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
subtopics of Science and write them
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
under science do we take all the
 
06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
subtopics of history and write those
 
06:08:25.868 --> 06:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
down and start just cataloging our our
 
06:08:25.878 --> 06:08:27.868 align:start position:0%
down and start just cataloging our our
legislation

06:08:27.868 --> 06:08:27.878 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:08:30.670 --> 06:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
statutes uh or or is this something that
 
06:08:33.230 --> 06:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're getting into we're micromanaging
 
06:08:35.868 --> 06:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
and should we be putting this elsewhere
 
06:08:38.390 --> 06:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know like in the rules and letting
 
06:08:40.868 --> 06:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
the locals deal with these
 
06:08:42.868 --> 06:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
issues they're the ones have to deal
 
06:08:45.190 --> 06:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
they're the
 
06:08:48.548 --> 06:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
teachers further discussion would it be
 
06:08:50.670 --> 06:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
a good uh idea Mr
 
06:08:54.590 --> 06:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
chairman to consider funding research in
 
06:08:57.590 --> 06:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
the universities on exactly the
 
06:09:00.628 --> 06:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
subject offering it basically a grant
 
06:09:03.990 --> 06:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
for research by the various colleges or
 
06:09:06.990 --> 06:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
schools of Education into the behaviors
 
06:09:09.548 --> 06:09:09.558 align:start position:0%
we're now seeing exhibited in the
 
06:09:13.110 --> 06:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
schools as to their causes possible
 
06:09:16.830 --> 06:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
responses etc etc well represent Ford I
 
06:09:19.070 --> 06:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
could respond to that and probably not
 
06:09:23.070 --> 06:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
in very positive terms um on the teacher
 
06:09:25.430 --> 06:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
shortage committee we had teachers that
 
06:09:27.430 --> 06:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
are new teachers to this State new
 
06:09:29.150 --> 06:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
teachers to profession and what did they
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
tell us and represent my you're a part
 
06:09:33.628 --> 06:09:33.638 align:start position:0%
of that I don't think I was properly
 
06:09:36.270 --> 06:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
prepared for what I'm walking into in my
 
06:09:36.280 --> 06:09:37.590 align:start position:0%
prepared for what I'm walking into in my
preparation

06:09:37.590 --> 06:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
preparation
 
06:09:40.430 --> 06:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
courses you know I I had a lot of the
 
06:09:43.628 --> 06:09:43.638 align:start position:0%
content and some of that but I walked in
 
06:09:45.990 --> 06:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
and and what I'm encountering is
 
06:09:48.628 --> 06:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
something I was never prepared
 
06:09:52.030 --> 06:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
for and to deal with that is is an issue
 
06:09:54.910 --> 06:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
so I you know I think that you know a
 
06:09:56.350 --> 06:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
lot of your college professors are
 
06:10:00.150 --> 06:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
sitting there in their in their their
 
06:10:02.270 --> 06:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
classrooms and they're not experiencing
 
06:10:04.110 --> 06:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
the reality of what we're encountering
 
06:10:07.350 --> 06:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
and it's just it's an awful situation so
 
06:10:08.830 --> 06:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
I don't put a lot of Hope in the in the
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
post-se secary system to fix this I wish
 
06:10:10.920 --> 06:10:12.430 align:start position:0%
post-se secary system to fix this I wish
they

06:10:12.430 --> 06:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:10:16.030 --> 06:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
would I respond mean I don't know if
 
06:10:19.708 --> 06:10:19.718 align:start position:0%
that's gerain to you know the motion on
 
06:10:19.718 --> 06:10:21.510 align:start position:0%
that's gerain to you know the motion on
the

06:10:21.510 --> 06:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
floor well it's we're we're on this
 
06:10:26.190 --> 06:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
topic of mental health and you know I
 
06:10:28.590 --> 06:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
guess we could could go forever on it so
 
06:10:31.350 --> 06:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh let's I I apologize for getting in
 
06:10:32.948 --> 06:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
the post of responding even to that
 
06:10:37.510 --> 06:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
question so but um let's represent
 
06:10:40.270 --> 06:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair just two
 
06:10:42.868 --> 06:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
remarks I don't think relying on the
 
06:10:45.030 --> 06:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
fact that this is in the 306 rules
 
06:10:48.830 --> 06:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
currently is a comfortable certainty for
 
06:10:51.150 --> 06:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
me certainly that that would continue to
 
06:10:53.350 --> 06:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
be the case given the DraStic revisions
 
06:10:55.230 --> 06:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
that are proposed and that have been
 
06:10:57.468 --> 06:10:57.478 align:start position:0%
largely not very transparent
 
06:11:00.110 --> 06:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't trust to rely on that and I
 
06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
would like to remind people of the
 
06:11:03.948 --> 06:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard from multiple
 
06:11:05.430 --> 06:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
young people last
 
06:11:08.590 --> 06:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
winter really amazingly articulate
 
06:11:11.110 --> 06:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
wonderful teens saying this is not
 
06:11:12.628 --> 06:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
happening in the schools now and it
 
06:11:14.910 --> 06:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
should be if you remember the young
 
06:11:17.190 --> 06:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
woman who is now a freshman at Welsley
 
06:11:19.510 --> 06:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
actually I don't recall if she was the
 
06:11:20.990 --> 06:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
person driving or if her friend was
 
06:11:22.390 --> 06:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
driving but her friend had a panic
 
06:11:23.750 --> 06:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
attack while they were in the car and
 
06:11:26.070 --> 06:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
neither one of them knew what it was
 
06:11:27.548 --> 06:11:27.558 align:start position:0%
fortunately this young woman had the
 
06:11:30.270 --> 06:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to look it up and figure it
 
06:11:32.070 --> 06:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
out and help her friend to
 
06:11:34.788 --> 06:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
safety we should be educating people to
 
06:11:37.948 --> 06:11:37.958 align:start position:0%
know what that looks like and
 
06:11:41.788 --> 06:11:41.798 align:start position:0%
how to First Aid it it's not treatment
 
06:11:44.070 --> 06:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's just safety for now it's not
 
06:11:44.080 --> 06:11:46.990 align:start position:0%
it's just safety for now it's not
happening

06:11:46.990 --> 06:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
enough well I I just want to clarify one
 
06:11:53.430 --> 06:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
thing that was said that we've been told
 
06:11:55.868 --> 06:11:55.878 align:start position:0%
that that's not going to happen is that
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
we were told by the Department of
 
06:12:00.628 --> 06:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
Education right here that they cannot
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
touch those substantive criteria areas
 
06:12:06.510 --> 06:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
those key elements that are under 193e
 
06:12:09.030 --> 06:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
by changing the rules the rules and
 
06:12:11.788 --> 06:12:11.798 align:start position:0%
those components are not going to change
 
06:12:13.990 --> 06:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
that came from Dr Green right here when
 
06:12:15.910 --> 06:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
he was testifying before us we asked him
 
06:12:18.070 --> 06:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
that question he said we are not going
 
06:12:20.708 --> 06:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
to be changing those areas in the e Ed
 
06:12:20.718 --> 06:12:22.548 align:start position:0%
to be changing those areas in the e Ed
306

06:12:22.548 --> 06:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
306
 
06:12:25.548 --> 06:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
redrafting so that that was spoken to us
 
06:12:28.390 --> 06:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
so uh I I think that that's you know I
 
06:12:30.910 --> 06:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
to say that Doe is going to change
 
06:12:32.350 --> 06:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
something or the state board's going
 
06:12:34.628 --> 06:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do that they've
 
06:12:36.788 --> 06:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
said they will not they cannot by
 
06:12:38.830 --> 06:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
Statute do
 
06:12:42.150 --> 06:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
it further discussion represent Hall
 
06:12:45.390 --> 06:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um this language as
 
06:12:47.868 --> 06:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
is seems to me could have the power of
 
06:12:49.910 --> 06:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
having an extremely powerful impact on
 
06:12:52.990 --> 06:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
kids I'm not seeing the downside of it
 
06:12:54.430 --> 06:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
other than oh it might be written
 
06:12:54.440 --> 06:12:55.350 align:start position:0%
other than oh it might be written
somewhere

06:12:55.350 --> 06:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
06:12:57.830 --> 06:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
else you know if somebody could you know
 
06:12:59.350 --> 06:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of testim a lot of
 
06:13:01.310 --> 06:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
conversation here but I'm not hearing
 
06:13:04.110 --> 06:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
really what is wrong with it other than
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
I you know is a how it affects
 
06:13:11.390 --> 06:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
kids further qu further discussion Madam

06:14:14.868 --> 06:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:14:17.390 --> 06:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
2374 I
 
06:14:17.400 --> 06:14:19.070 align:start position:0%
2374 I
thought

06:14:19.070 --> 06:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
thought
 
06:14:21.628 --> 06:14:21.638 align:start position:0%
well we we have a motion that ought to
 
06:14:24.628 --> 06:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
pass in the floor right now and yes this
 
06:14:26.270 --> 06:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
would be an appropriate time for you to
 
06:14:28.190 --> 06:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
put Amendment forward represent Bel
 
06:14:30.350 --> 06:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I would like to
 
06:14:35.868 --> 06:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
introduce this amendment 2374 H um I I
 
06:14:38.708 --> 06:14:38.718 align:start position:0%
legitimately spent a good deal of time
 
06:14:41.548 --> 06:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
um trying to figure out where we might
 
06:14:43.390 --> 06:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
agree where we might disagree and where
 
06:14:45.590 --> 06:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
we might find a center
 
06:14:48.230 --> 06:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
ground we I think we had a copy we're
 
06:14:50.110 --> 06:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
we're all looking for those represent
 
06:14:52.230 --> 06:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
Bel I think you provided me yeah they
 
06:14:55.070 --> 06:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
should have come around earlier uh is it
 
06:15:01.868 --> 06:15:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:05.070 --> 06:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
good you don't you don't have them
 
06:15:08.788 --> 06:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
um we didn't get it over who has not got
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
it I don't think anybody so it stopped
 
06:15:12.240 --> 06:15:21.190 align:start position:0%
it I don't think anybody so it stopped
somewhere

06:15:21.190 --> 06:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:23.788 --> 06:15:23.798 align:start position:0%
okay anyway I'll without getting into
 
06:15:25.948 --> 06:15:25.958 align:start position:0%
the details of it I'll keep talking hold
 
06:15:29.910 --> 06:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:32.190 --> 06:15:32.200 align:start position:0%
sure we they I think they should have
 
06:15:37.350 --> 06:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:37.360 --> 06:15:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:15:43.830 --> 06:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:46.190 --> 06:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
there excellent so I I tried to think
 
06:15:47.548 --> 06:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
real hard about where we might agree and
 
06:15:48.948 --> 06:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
where we might disagree on this and I
 
06:15:50.868 --> 06:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
think we can all agree that there that
 
06:15:52.708 --> 06:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
there is an issue that we would like to
 
06:15:55.390 --> 06:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
address and I think the concerns that
 
06:15:58.030 --> 06:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
many of us had have really mostly boil
 
06:16:01.150 --> 06:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
down to a concern that that there could
 
06:16:04.990 --> 06:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
be a line crossed where we're going from
 
06:16:06.990 --> 06:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
um information and providing students
 
06:16:08.750 --> 06:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
with information you know tools for
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
their toolbox to moving and
 
06:16:13.468 --> 06:16:13.478 align:start position:0%
transitioning to the um administration
 
06:16:15.390 --> 06:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
of healthcare at a classroom which would
 
06:16:18.628 --> 06:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
be um something that could really be
 
06:16:20.110 --> 06:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
more harmful than
 
06:16:22.270 --> 06:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
helpful um so I've I've pulled
 
06:16:24.430 --> 06:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
information and and language from the
 
06:16:25.830 --> 06:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
National Institutes of Health that help
 
06:16:27.948 --> 06:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
me to Define what constitutes the
 
06:16:32.070 --> 06:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
practice of psychology and I I change
 
06:16:33.868 --> 06:16:33.878 align:start position:0%
the language from instead of mental
 
06:16:35.830 --> 06:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
health to psychological conditions and
 
06:16:38.270 --> 06:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
stress disorders not because there's any
 
06:16:39.628 --> 06:16:39.638 align:start position:0%
significant meaningful difference
 
06:16:41.510 --> 06:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
between those two bits of language but I
 
06:16:43.190 --> 06:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
feel like psychological conditions and
 
06:16:45.548 --> 06:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
stress disorders is a little bit more a
 
06:16:46.868 --> 06:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
little bit more tangible a little bit
 
06:16:50.590 --> 06:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
less nebulous um it would allow and I
 
06:16:51.788 --> 06:16:51.798 align:start position:0%
and I know some people have really
 
06:16:53.708 --> 06:16:53.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to put this in the law so this
 
06:16:56.548 --> 06:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
this would do that they would allow for
 
06:17:00.070 --> 06:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
the the overview as Official Guidelines
 
06:17:02.468 --> 06:17:02.478 align:start position:0%
of psychological conditions and stress
 
06:17:06.750 --> 06:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
disorders without without the putting
 
06:17:08.788 --> 06:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
those guard rails up so we make sure we
 
06:17:10.190 --> 06:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
don't get into the practice where
 
06:17:13.548 --> 06:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
teachers are beginning to do things
 
06:17:15.070 --> 06:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
where they were recommending treatments
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
and procedures and practices that would
 
06:17:21.390 --> 06:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
um that would constitute the practice of
 
06:17:24.270 --> 06:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
mental health care that would create a
 
06:17:26.070 --> 06:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
potential problem for students because
 
06:17:27.430 --> 06:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
they're not in an environment where
 
06:17:29.230 --> 06:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
that's where they're ready for that in a
 
06:17:30.990 --> 06:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
classroom perhaps in a guidance
 
06:17:32.230 --> 06:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
counselor's office but not in a
 
06:17:34.270 --> 06:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
classroom we're putting we don't want to
 
06:17:36.430 --> 06:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
put that on teachers where they're in a
 
06:17:37.910 --> 06:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
situation where they could even have
 
06:17:39.788 --> 06:17:39.798 align:start position:0%
liability for recommending treatments
 
06:17:43.230 --> 06:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
and whatnot um so I I really think this
 
06:17:45.830 --> 06:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
could walk the line as a as a compromise
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
um position thank you need a second yeah
 
06:17:52.830 --> 06:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
was was there a second on the I don't
 
06:17:55.590 --> 06:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
think so okay so there we have a second
 
06:17:58.270 --> 06:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:58.280 --> 06:17:59.468 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:17:59.468 --> 06:17:59.478 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:18:03.350 --> 06:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman Le um v i I
 
06:18:07.230 --> 06:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
have I understand the the um and
 
06:18:09.230 --> 06:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that you try to keep
 
06:18:12.910 --> 06:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
this B Alive this however I have when
 
06:18:14.430 --> 06:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
the two the spiritual peace doesn't
 
06:18:16.670 --> 06:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
bother me at all but uh omitting that
 
06:18:18.750 --> 06:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
what what does bother me is treatment
 
06:18:21.230 --> 06:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
and wellness practices for instance
 
06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
common common Wellness practices like
 
06:18:27.708 --> 06:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
breathing or exercise ing bad diet
 
06:18:30.190 --> 06:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
walking outside to help with stress or
 
06:18:34.110 --> 06:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
or or uh other types of issues uh you
 
06:18:35.628 --> 06:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
may consider those treatment some keep
 
06:18:38.548 --> 06:18:38.558 align:start position:0%
Wellness practices when you take those
 
06:18:41.590 --> 06:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities for reasonable simple age
 
06:18:44.390 --> 06:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate Solutions out of the options
 
06:18:46.910 --> 06:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the teachers toolbox then we're not
 
06:18:49.070 --> 06:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
really giving them in these these
 
06:18:51.750 --> 06:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
students anything creditable that they
 
06:18:53.750 --> 06:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
can use when they have the opportunity
 
06:18:54.990 --> 06:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
right there it's like you're you're
 
06:18:56.628 --> 06:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
you're prepping them not showing them
 
06:18:59.468 --> 06:18:59.478 align:start position:0%
how to go to the next step so I I just I
 
06:19:01.830 --> 06:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
I find that um and I think this you're
 
06:19:03.628 --> 06:19:03.638 align:start position:0%
intense fine M but I just those two
 
06:19:06.430 --> 06:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
things to take those two critical Parts
 
06:19:09.150 --> 06:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
out of this piece I think it just Waters
 
06:19:11.510 --> 06:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
it down to make it valueless uh in my
 
06:19:13.150 --> 06:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
point because I think those treatments
 
06:19:15.150 --> 06:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
and wellness practices without being
 
06:19:16.750 --> 06:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
without even thinking about being a
 
06:19:18.390 --> 06:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
doctor lawyer Indian chief we're just
 
06:19:19.868 --> 06:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
talking about typical stuff that can be
 
06:19:23.868 --> 06:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
used in in this case thank you Mr chair
 
06:19:26.430 --> 06:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative beler
 
06:19:28.150 --> 06:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you just to offer a quick response
 
06:19:29.830 --> 06:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
on that from the National Institutes of
 
06:19:33.430 --> 06:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
Health Website uh under elements of
 
06:19:36.150 --> 06:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
psychotherapy um it says applying
 
06:19:38.270 --> 06:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
mindfulness and relaxation techniques
 
06:19:39.910 --> 06:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
such as meditation and breathing
 
06:19:43.270 --> 06:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
exercises so I think the the real the
 
06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
real thing that we're looking at here is
 
06:19:47.150 --> 06:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
and the difference between a PR the
 
06:19:49.030 --> 06:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
practicing of medicine versus just
 
06:19:51.910 --> 06:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
normal human interactions is is a is a
 
06:19:54.590 --> 06:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
teacher acting on her own or his her own
 
06:19:56.390 --> 06:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
accord to
 
06:19:58.868 --> 06:19:58.878 align:start position:0%
to tell a student you know hey take a
 
06:20:01.350 --> 06:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
breath you know count to 10 and then
 
06:20:03.788 --> 06:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
respond and and just things like that
 
06:20:05.110 --> 06:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
which are normal parts of Human
 
06:20:07.948 --> 06:20:07.958 align:start position:0%
Relationships and interactions or is it
 
06:20:12.590 --> 06:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
are we codifying in law and in and in uh
 
06:20:14.350 --> 06:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
procedures that we're going to be
 
06:20:16.830 --> 06:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
administering these things to the class
 
06:20:18.868 --> 06:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
because I think that's when we start
 
06:20:20.868 --> 06:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
Crossing that line into Healthcare and
 
06:20:22.548 --> 06:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
and I think that's backed up by this
 
06:20:26.390 --> 06:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
definition on on the NIH page
 
06:20:29.510 --> 06:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
one more yes go ahead I think this
 
06:20:31.390 --> 06:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
committee and this legislature over the
 
06:20:34.030 --> 06:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
last year has put teachers in such a
 
06:20:36.310 --> 06:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
honest position and fightful what they
 
06:20:38.708 --> 06:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
can say and cannot say in the classroom
 
06:20:39.868 --> 06:20:39.878 align:start position:0%
when we just talk about something as
 
06:20:42.350 --> 06:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
simple as breathing relax take a step
 
06:20:43.830 --> 06:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
back some teachers going be afraid to
 
06:20:46.110 --> 06:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
say that could now someone may interpret
 
06:20:47.708 --> 06:20:47.718 align:start position:0%
as you did that you could be predicting
 
06:20:50.750 --> 06:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
or or or or or prescribing activities we
 
06:20:52.910 --> 06:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
have not made it easy for teachers to me
 
06:20:54.590 --> 06:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
we made it a horrible profession people
 
06:20:56.030 --> 06:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
to get into you wonder there's the
 
06:20:57.750 --> 06:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
shortage they aren't prepared and what
 
06:20:59.510 --> 06:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
we give them their hands are cuffed we
 
06:21:01.510 --> 06:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
just can't keep on doing this and expect
 
06:21:04.150 --> 06:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
kids to grow and be and well and coming
 
06:21:05.788 --> 06:21:05.798 align:start position:0%
and teachers to come into the business
 
06:21:08.150 --> 06:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just not a well it's not
 
06:21:10.990 --> 06:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
a good thing to do in my mind further
 
06:21:13.868 --> 06:21:13.878 align:start position:0%
discussion yes representative Tanner
 
06:21:16.270 --> 06:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'd just like to follow on
 
06:21:18.750 --> 06:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
representative woodcox uh because the
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
minute that you presented this and I'm
 
06:21:23.070 --> 06:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
looking at it in Wellness practice and
 
06:21:25.390 --> 06:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
treatments I'm thinking of the health
 
06:21:27.390 --> 06:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
class that I had where we did stress
 
06:21:29.270 --> 06:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
reduction and we talked about deep
 
06:21:31.830 --> 06:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
breathing exercises and we did we
 
06:21:33.868 --> 06:21:33.878 align:start position:0%
practiced a couple of those and about
 
06:21:36.350 --> 06:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
coaching where I had kids that were
 
06:21:38.110 --> 06:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
particularly anxious about being in a
 
06:21:39.788 --> 06:21:39.798 align:start position:0%
game or if there was a big crowd or if
 
06:21:42.150 --> 06:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
we were going to the championship about
 
06:21:45.310 --> 06:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
counting to 10 about going through a
 
06:21:49.948 --> 06:21:49.958 align:start position:0%
certain um type of of procedure when
 
06:21:52.070 --> 06:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
they're at the foul line you know to
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
bounce twice to take a deep breath to
 
06:21:56.548 --> 06:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
look at the basket before they shoot so
 
06:21:59.030 --> 06:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
that they block out a lot of things uh
 
06:22:01.548 --> 06:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
positive visualization before you go
 
06:22:04.868 --> 06:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
into a test or you're you're in a game
 
06:22:06.750 --> 06:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh or you're going down a slom course
 
06:22:08.270 --> 06:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
just closing your eyes and going down
 
06:22:10.230 --> 06:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
through the solom course and seeing you
 
06:22:13.070 --> 06:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
come out the other end and as a winner
 
06:22:17.070 --> 06:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
um and I can't tell I actually um had
 
06:22:19.350 --> 06:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
just probably a year ago a young man
 
06:22:22.230 --> 06:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
come up to me and now I haven't taught
 
06:22:25.590 --> 06:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
since two 2004 and he said that the only
 
06:22:28.030 --> 06:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
reason he made it through basic training
 
06:22:29.628 --> 06:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
was because he did the breathing
 
06:22:31.670 --> 06:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
exercises that he learned in health
 
06:22:34.830 --> 06:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
class so I totally agree with uh
 
06:22:38.590 --> 06:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock that you're just
 
06:22:39.990 --> 06:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
people are going to read this this is
 
06:22:42.788 --> 06:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
just like all the other divisive concept
 
06:22:45.628 --> 06:22:45.638 align:start position:0%
thing and it's going to change it's
 
06:22:49.030 --> 06:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
going to it it changes the whole dynamic
 
06:22:50.750 --> 06:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
between a teacher and a student between
 
06:22:55.830 --> 06:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
a coach and a player um between an adult
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
and a trusted adult and a kid that is
 
06:23:01.468 --> 06:23:01.478 align:start position:0%
really experiencing panic attack or
 
06:23:05.830 --> 06:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
anxiety or just needs one or two little
 
06:23:08.910 --> 06:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
cues so that they can make it through
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
that high stakes testing that they're
 
06:23:14.468 --> 06:23:14.478 align:start position:0%
doing or or the you know the the fou
 
06:23:16.628 --> 06:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
shot that they have to make so there's
 
06:23:20.390 --> 06:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
no way I could could uh support this
 
06:23:24.468 --> 06:23:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:24.478 --> 06:23:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

06:23:25.990 --> 06:23:26.000 align:start position:0%

o'clock

06:24:24.350 --> 06:24:24.360 align:start position:0%

okay chairman lad we go forward I got a
 
06:35:51.830 --> 06:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
procedural question we have one of our
 
06:35:54.110 --> 06:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
members of our cers that like to change
 
06:35:54.120 --> 06:35:54.830 align:start position:0%
members of our cers that like to change
their

06:35:54.830 --> 06:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:02.350 --> 06:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
267 representative
 
06:36:06.430 --> 06:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
McDonald uh brought forth a motion to
 
06:36:06.440 --> 06:36:07.788 align:start position:0%
McDonald uh brought forth a motion to
income

06:36:07.788 --> 06:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
income
 
06:36:11.708 --> 06:36:11.718 align:start position:0%
study and one of our members was change
 
06:36:16.150 --> 06:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
their and go back and do that well we
 
06:36:18.670 --> 06:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
could you could we could entertain a
 
06:36:21.150 --> 06:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider yes that can be
 
06:36:22.708 --> 06:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
done right now because we're still in
 
06:36:24.628 --> 06:36:24.638 align:start position:0%
possession of the bill okay would move
 
06:36:27.430 --> 06:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
to reconsider it because it was a 101
 
06:36:31.310 --> 06:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
vote right yes a 101 so I would move to
 
06:36:33.628 --> 06:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
reconsider so one of our members could
 
06:36:38.548 --> 06:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
change their vote to support the interim
 
06:36:42.830 --> 06:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
study okay uh first before we get there
 
06:36:44.468 --> 06:36:44.478 align:start position:0%
I I have another question for the whole
 
06:36:46.310 --> 06:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee here we have few bills left
 
06:36:48.788 --> 06:36:48.798 align:start position:0%
and we're holding up OS they can't go
 
06:36:52.030 --> 06:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
home until we go home are we
 
06:36:54.948 --> 06:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
going poor people so what what we have
 
06:36:56.468 --> 06:36:56.478 align:start position:0%
to do is we have to let Jen know are
 
06:36:58.230 --> 06:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
there going to be any more amendments
 
06:37:00.230 --> 06:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
coming out any changes to anything or
 
06:37:01.830 --> 06:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
are we just going with what we got and
 
06:37:04.430 --> 06:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to clean it up today I know
 
06:37:05.830 --> 06:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
across the hallway sometimes they've
 
06:37:09.310 --> 06:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
gone to 5:00 5:30 but they let OS go
 
06:37:10.948 --> 06:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
home I think what we've got is what
 
06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:28.430 --> 06:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
home so we have a so my motion is to
 
06:37:32.628 --> 06:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
reconsider uh reconsider House Bill 267
 
06:37:33.910 --> 06:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
06:37:37.150 --> 06:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
second second okay so we have a motion
 
06:37:39.150 --> 06:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
made by represent Miler
 
06:37:42.230 --> 06:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
and this one's still on the table well
 
06:37:44.150 --> 06:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
the motion is just for
 
06:37:46.548 --> 06:37:46.558 align:start position:0%

06:47:38.070 --> 06:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
issues that um surround this bill are
 
06:47:40.910 --> 06:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
several um there is no appropriation of
 
06:47:44.910 --> 06:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
funds for the grant that it sets up um I
 
06:47:46.990 --> 06:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
do not recall any statistics being uh
 
06:47:50.310 --> 06:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
presented justifying the
 
06:47:52.948 --> 06:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
expenditure there are many other options
 
06:47:54.150 --> 06:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
current ly being looked at and
 
06:47:56.548 --> 06:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
entertained both by this committee and
 
06:47:59.948 --> 06:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
others as far as um uh grants and other
 
06:48:03.110 --> 06:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
things teachers for hiring and
 
06:48:06.230 --> 06:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
retaining um and also local options to
 
06:48:12.788 --> 06:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:15.548 --> 06:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
already and I I'll you know say we we
 
06:48:17.750 --> 06:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
dealt with other bills today uh that are
 
06:48:20.590 --> 06:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue similar type
 
06:48:24.788 --> 06:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
issues and so uh I I agree with what uh
 
06:48:26.830 --> 06:48:26.840 align:start position:0%

that the uh
 
06:48:41.350 --> 06:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
um the department would
 
06:48:44.190 --> 06:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
require uh half a million dollars a year

um uh thank you um we've had a lot of
 
06:53:38.510 --> 06:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
discussion about this bill um
 
06:53:41.350 --> 06:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh several sections were
 
06:53:43.788 --> 06:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
uh ruled non gerain today so they will
 
06:53:47.110 --> 06:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
be brought up next year but few points I
 
06:53:50.670 --> 06:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to make um the science of reading
 
06:53:53.350 --> 06:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
is a body of research that's been done
 
06:53:56.510 --> 06:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
over the past several decades including
 
06:54:01.230 --> 06:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
research on how the brain works um it is
 
06:54:05.548 --> 06:54:05.558 align:start position:0%
not an ideology a philosophy a political
 
06:54:11.868 --> 06:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:16.150 --> 06:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
cartel we in this bill there are several
 
06:54:20.990 --> 06:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
important um aspects to it um
 
06:54:24.270 --> 06:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
proficiency at the third grade we know
 
06:54:27.150 --> 06:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
what what that looks like here in the
 
06:54:31.350 --> 06:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
state um and it's been said that from
 
06:54:33.590 --> 06:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through the third grade
 
06:54:36.030 --> 06:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
children are learning to read beginning
 
06:54:39.750 --> 06:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the fourth grade they're reading to
 
06:54:43.070 --> 06:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
learn so what are we doing to them if at
 
06:54:45.548 --> 06:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
the end of the third grade they can't
 
06:54:48.990 --> 06:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
read that impacts their
 
06:54:53.070 --> 06:54:53.080 align:start position:0%
future um we talked about mental illness
 
06:54:56.910 --> 06:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh just a little while ago
 
06:55:00.070 --> 06:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
um don't you think if a
 
06:55:03.230 --> 06:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
child cannot read is struggling to read
 
06:55:06.070 --> 06:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
in the third or fourth grade or later
 
06:55:08.388 --> 06:55:08.398 align:start position:0%
that they might have anxiety and

06:56:57.628 --> 06:56:57.638 align:start position:0%
even five or six of those categories we
 
06:56:59.190 --> 06:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:57:02.430 --> 06:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
one if the original Bill had passed or
 
06:57:04.110 --> 06:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
the original
 
06:57:08.230 --> 06:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh this follows on to doe
 
06:57:10.868 --> 06:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
initiatives um just recently I was
 
06:57:15.190 --> 06:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
reading about um a July um initiative
 
06:57:19.670 --> 06:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
micro credentials are now available for
 
06:57:23.270 --> 06:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
educators in the science of
 
06:57:26.910 --> 06:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:29.030 --> 06:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
credentials letters training we've
 
06:57:30.750 --> 06:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
talked about over
 
06:57:33.788 --> 06:57:33.798 align:start position:0%
3,000 teachers and parents and
 
06:57:37.150 --> 06:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
grandparents have been trained um in the
 
06:57:40.070 --> 06:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
science of reading and uh evidence-based
 
06:57:40.080 --> 06:57:41.990 align:start position:0%
science of reading and uh evidence-based
research

06:57:41.990 --> 06:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
research
 
06:57:46.670 --> 06:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
um but what happens to those teachers
 
06:57:49.070 --> 06:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
who go through this extensive and it's
 
06:57:51.670 --> 06:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
extensive training but then walk back
 
06:57:54.070 --> 06:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
into the class room where they're doing
 
06:57:56.350 --> 06:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
using instructional materials based on
 
06:57:59.150 --> 06:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
balance of literacy which is contrary to
 
06:58:00.948 --> 06:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
everything that they've learned what are
 
06:58:03.388 --> 06:58:03.398 align:start position:0%
we we're wasting their time we're
 
06:58:11.070 --> 06:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:11.080 --> 06:58:13.708 align:start position:0%
 
time

06:58:13.708 --> 06:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:58:16.670 --> 06:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I've worked on this
 
06:58:19.708 --> 06:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
legislation with local people I've been
 
06:58:22.990 --> 06:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
to professional development sessions
 
06:58:26.190 --> 06:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
in londondary I've been to two or three
 
06:58:29.868 --> 06:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
seminars um around the state um with
 
06:58:34.270 --> 06:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
Educators um related to uh this uh
 
06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
legislation um I've had a national and
 
06:58:41.190 --> 06:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
international conversations with
 
06:58:44.510 --> 06:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
Educators reviewing this
 
06:58:48.948 --> 06:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
legislation um one of whom um is an
 
06:58:51.628 --> 06:58:51.638 align:start position:0%
international expert was the co-author
 
06:58:55.070 --> 06:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
of letter program has worked extensively
 
06:58:57.788 --> 06:58:57.798 align:start position:0%
with this and I was in conversation with
 
06:58:59.190 --> 06:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
with her last
 
06:59:07.310 --> 06:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:10.868 --> 06:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
criticisms kids learn differently well
 
06:59:14.670 --> 06:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
right but according to research
 
06:59:19.030 --> 06:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
95% of students who learn learn using
 
06:59:21.350 --> 06:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
this type of instruction can learn to
 
06:59:21.360 --> 06:59:26.830 align:start position:0%
this type of instruction can learn to
read

06:59:26.830 --> 06:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:28.468 --> 06:59:28.478 align:start position:0%
what do we and when you compare that to
 
06:59:31.948 --> 06:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
our current literacy rates doesn't that
 
06:59:34.948 --> 06:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
that speak volumes about the direction
 
06:59:38.628 --> 06:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
we need to go um you know unfortunately
 
06:59:40.628 --> 06:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
sections that I'll bring back next year
 
06:59:43.788 --> 06:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
are critical critical sections teacher
 
06:59:43.798 --> 06:59:45.388 align:start position:0%
are critical critical sections teacher

06:59:45.388 --> 06:59:45.398 align:start position:0%

06:59:48.430 --> 06:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
programs H what are we doing when we've
 
06:59:51.830 --> 06:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
got and um the uh National Quality
 
06:59:51.840 --> 06:59:52.750 align:start position:0%
got and um the uh National Quality

06:59:52.750 --> 06:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
06:59:57.230 --> 06:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
um Council raid did a survey and rid
 
07:00:00.708 --> 07:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
colleges three colleges in New Hampshire
 
07:00:03.310 --> 07:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
including you got a D or an F in their
 
07:00:05.868 --> 07:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
teacher prep programs using this
 
07:00:08.788 --> 07:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
research that has been done over
 
07:00:08.798 --> 07:00:10.388 align:start position:0%
research that has been done over
decades

07:00:10.388 --> 07:00:10.398 align:start position:0%
decades
 
07:00:15.388 --> 07:00:15.398 align:start position:0%
um in terms of waiting let's wait let's
 
07:00:18.468 --> 07:00:18.478 align:start position:0%
wait let's wait but the screening call
 
07:00:21.430 --> 07:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
for in this Pro in this program um in
 
07:00:24.910 --> 07:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't start until January
 
07:00:28.350 --> 07:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
2025 but in the meantime we can get
 
07:00:30.590 --> 07:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
started getting reports from the
 
07:00:33.110 --> 07:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
07:00:36.310 --> 07:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
um advancing with uh parental
 
07:00:39.868 --> 07:00:39.878 align:start position:0%
involvement and and instruction uh
 
07:00:42.388 --> 07:00:42.398 align:start position:0%
identifying instructional materials by
 
07:00:44.030 --> 07:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education which is all
 
07:00:45.868 --> 07:00:45.878 align:start position:0%
called for in this
 
07:00:49.948 --> 07:00:49.958 align:start position:0%
bill and if we wait what are we doing to
 
07:00:52.670 --> 07:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
those first and second graders who might
 
07:00:54.830 --> 07:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
be struggling to read right now we're
 
07:00:57.708 --> 07:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
sentencing them to another 2 years of
 
07:01:00.388 --> 07:01:00.398 align:start position:0%
inability to read
 
07:01:00.398 --> 07:01:02.468 align:start position:0%
inability to read
properly

07:01:02.468 --> 07:01:02.478 align:start position:0%
properly
 
07:01:06.310 --> 07:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
um you know it's easy to do nothing it's
 
07:01:09.230 --> 07:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
easy but sometimes it takes courage to
 
07:01:09.240 --> 07:01:10.788 align:start position:0%
easy but sometimes it takes courage to
do

07:01:10.788 --> 07:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:01:16.388 --> 07:01:16.398 align:start position:0%
something thank you thank you further
 
07:01:20.150 --> 07:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:23.030 --> 07:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
leus when we talked about about this in
 
07:01:23.040 --> 07:01:24.468 align:start position:0%
leus when we talked about about this in
interim

07:01:24.468 --> 07:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
interim
 
07:01:24.478 --> 07:01:26.708 align:start position:0%
interim
study

07:01:26.708 --> 07:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
study
 
07:01:31.230 --> 07:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
um R cascaden who has been who has
 
07:01:36.750 --> 07:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
instituted this in her area already said
 
07:01:40.230 --> 07:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
that everybody should already be doing
 
07:01:42.750 --> 07:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
this everybody should already be doing
 
07:01:46.030 --> 07:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
this and the problem is they're not they
 
07:01:48.910 --> 07:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't all have such good leadership and
 
07:01:51.030 --> 07:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
they they are not all doing this so this
 
07:01:53.830 --> 07:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
is to try to make sure everybody is
 
07:01:53.840 --> 07:01:54.830 align:start position:0%
is to try to make sure everybody is
doing

07:01:54.830 --> 07:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
doing
 
07:01:59.190 --> 07:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
this if I could go ahead yeah um we've
 
07:02:01.788 --> 07:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
had several letters from teachers in
 
07:02:04.270 --> 07:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
conquered talking about the fact that
 
07:02:06.948 --> 07:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
they don't do this there um I've been
 
07:02:10.628 --> 07:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
working with a specialed reading
 
07:02:13.110 --> 07:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
specialist who just
 
07:02:15.548 --> 07:02:15.558 align:start position:0%
transferred out of her District to a new
 
07:02:17.548 --> 07:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
District because she was tired of
 
07:02:19.468 --> 07:02:19.478 align:start position:0%
banging her head against the wall for 3
 
07:02:21.430 --> 07:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
years trying to get them to move in this
 
07:02:23.388 --> 07:02:23.398 align:start position:0%
direction and in her old District so she
 
07:02:25.468 --> 07:02:25.478 align:start position:0%
switched districts to a district that
 
07:02:27.670 --> 07:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
was doing
 
07:02:30.708 --> 07:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
this further
 
07:02:32.990 --> 07:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
discussion yes represent Tanner and then
 
07:02:37.430 --> 07:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank you um I think last
 
07:02:40.270 --> 07:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
year when we had the or last part of
 
07:02:43.070 --> 07:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
this year when we had the dyslexia bill
 
07:02:45.468 --> 07:02:45.478 align:start position:0%
that is now gone through here and been
 
07:02:47.190 --> 07:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor and now in law
 
07:02:50.430 --> 07:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
where students are now tested three
 
07:02:53.230 --> 07:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
times a year between first and third
 
07:02:55.948 --> 07:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
fourth grade and if there's a
 
07:02:59.150 --> 07:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
dyslexia uh possibility immediate
 
07:03:01.910 --> 07:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
intervention happens and I've heard from
 
07:03:03.830 --> 07:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of people that it's really made
 
07:03:06.788 --> 07:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
a difference in in uh what's happening
 
07:03:08.708 --> 07:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
in first through third grade but I agree
 
07:03:11.468 --> 07:03:11.478 align:start position:0%
that some of this material needs to also
 
07:03:15.708 --> 07:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
be pushed thank you yes um I think
 
07:03:18.788 --> 07:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
actually in 377 which is in law now it's
 
07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
only twice a year is required for
 
07:03:24.350 --> 07:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
screening that they already had to do
 
07:03:26.270 --> 07:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
well yeah the same would apply here but
 
07:03:29.670 --> 07:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
there are three required um and uh
 
07:03:33.868 --> 07:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
dislexia is maybe 15% of the students
 
07:03:35.628 --> 07:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
what about all the rest because we're
 
07:03:37.670 --> 07:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
not addressing them in
 
07:03:40.468 --> 07:03:40.478 align:start position:0%
377 but we are addressing them here
 
07:03:42.670 --> 07:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
let's take care of those students also
 
07:03:42.680 --> 07:03:43.628 align:start position:0%
let's take care of those students also
re

07:03:43.628 --> 07:03:43.638 align:start position:0%
re
 
07:03:46.350 --> 07:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
luno thank you Mr chair so you know I've
 
07:03:48.190 --> 07:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
never been a professional educator and I
 
07:03:51.150 --> 07:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of of um former
 
07:03:53.270 --> 07:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
profession professional Educators around
 
07:03:56.070 --> 07:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
this table but um reading's always been
 
07:03:59.270 --> 07:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
important to my family um uh my mom and
 
07:04:01.030 --> 07:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
dad owned Gibson's bookstore here in
 
07:04:04.628 --> 07:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
conquer in the 60s and 70s um my mom was
 
07:04:07.190 --> 07:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
a librarian in hopkington for a decade
 
07:04:09.628 --> 07:04:09.638 align:start position:0%
followed by 15 years as the reference
 
07:04:11.510 --> 07:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
librarian here in conquer she also had a
 
07:04:13.670 --> 07:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
career as a public school teacher both
 
07:04:16.388 --> 07:04:16.398 align:start position:0%
in sandwich and in hopkington uh so
 
07:04:18.230 --> 07:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
reading is very important to me and I
 
07:04:19.948 --> 07:04:19.958 align:start position:0%
understand it certainly from being on
 
07:04:22.590 --> 07:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
the school board that you um you learn
 
07:04:25.468 --> 07:04:25.478 align:start position:0%
to read and then read to learn and and
 
07:04:28.430 --> 07:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh and that's it that reading is a
 
07:04:32.388 --> 07:04:32.398 align:start position:0%
critical instructional tool and um and
 
07:04:34.270 --> 07:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh important for all students but I'll
 
07:04:35.910 --> 07:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
tell you I don't have to get very far
 
07:04:39.430 --> 07:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
into this bill um before I run into a
 
07:04:41.510 --> 07:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
wall of words
 
07:04:44.990 --> 07:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
that I just can't support um in the
 
07:04:47.468 --> 07:04:47.478 align:start position:0%
current under the current climate the
 
07:04:49.910 --> 07:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
first set is on page 11 the department
 
07:04:52.190 --> 07:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
of educ on page 11 line 11
 
07:04:53.788 --> 07:04:53.798 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education shall
 
07:04:55.150 --> 07:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
identify and
 
07:04:58.990 --> 07:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
contract um I've seen the results of
 
07:05:00.868 --> 07:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
when they identifying contract and the
 
07:05:03.948 --> 07:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
results have not been good and um down
 
07:05:05.030 --> 07:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
on page
 
07:05:09.030 --> 07:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
29 um all public school on page 20 line
 
07:05:11.670 --> 07:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
29 all public schools and Charter Public
 
07:05:14.388 --> 07:05:14.398 align:start position:0%
Schools shall screen all students in
 
07:05:16.830 --> 07:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
kindergarten use through grade three
 
07:05:18.510 --> 07:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
using the universal screen reader
 
07:05:21.788 --> 07:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
approved by the department again um uh
 
07:05:23.948 --> 07:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
no no real standards there for whatever
 
07:05:26.350 --> 07:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
they're approving and Contracting with
 
07:05:28.468 --> 07:05:28.478 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of questions um that
 
07:05:30.468 --> 07:05:30.478 align:start position:0%
Grant Staters would have about the
 
07:05:33.030 --> 07:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
Judgment that comes um uh from the
 
07:05:35.548 --> 07:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the state board so um
 
07:05:40.750 --> 07:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
so I I I I like the the the idea I
 
07:05:43.110 --> 07:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
certainly think we heard uh a lot of
 
07:05:46.030 --> 07:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
comments during the um during the public
 
07:05:48.190 --> 07:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and during work set several work
 
07:05:51.190 --> 07:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
sessions on this bill with with regards
 
07:05:55.708 --> 07:05:55.718 align:start position:0%
to the efficacy of of the um of the
 
07:05:58.190 --> 07:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
instructional practices that that that
 
07:06:00.670 --> 07:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
this bill uh promotes but also the
 
07:06:03.310 --> 07:06:03.320 align:start position:0%
importance to not rule out other
 
07:06:06.110 --> 07:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
instructional practices or or curriculum
 
07:06:07.628 --> 07:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
that are necessary to be part of the
 
07:06:11.670 --> 07:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
toolkit so I I really I can't support a
 
07:06:14.110 --> 07:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
u an a to pass on this it's not because
 
07:06:15.628 --> 07:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
I don't have courage it's not because I
 
07:06:18.350 --> 07:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't like reading uh it's not uh you
 
07:06:20.190 --> 07:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
know because I don't have an experience
 
07:06:22.070 --> 07:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
I don't have experience as a as an
 
07:06:25.110 --> 07:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
educator but uh do have experience as
 
07:06:28.708 --> 07:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
being a legislator and on school boards
 
07:06:31.310 --> 07:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
that uh that that the language used in
 
07:06:33.590 --> 07:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
this bill under the current climate uh
 
07:06:37.590 --> 07:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
is just unworkable and um uh but I would
 
07:06:40.030 --> 07:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
support a um you know interim study type
 
07:06:41.910 --> 07:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
motion for this thank
 
07:06:46.590 --> 07:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
you further discussion represent
 
07:06:49.270 --> 07:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
leus this sounds to me like another
 
07:06:52.350 --> 07:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
attack on the doe um
 
07:06:55.948 --> 07:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
um the doe is supposed to be making this
 
07:06:58.910 --> 07:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
screener available to districts at no
 
07:07:03.510 --> 07:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
cost so why they would not identify it
 
07:07:04.910 --> 07:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
and figure out which one they're going
 
07:07:08.030 --> 07:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
to make available at no cost I don't
 
07:07:12.150 --> 07:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
know it sounds not like we
 
07:07:14.350 --> 07:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
should it just sounds like another
 
07:07:17.110 --> 07:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
attack on the doe that's
 
07:07:19.910 --> 07:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
all representative
 
07:07:22.190 --> 07:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
cascaden I I think think that we would
 
07:07:24.388 --> 07:07:24.398 align:start position:0%
not disagree on the fact that reading is
 
07:07:26.468 --> 07:07:26.478 align:start position:0%
one of the most fundamental skills we
 
07:07:29.070 --> 07:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
need to teach all
 
07:07:31.548 --> 07:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
kids I think that this is government
 
07:07:34.468 --> 07:07:34.478 align:start position:0%
overreach in the sense that curriculum
 
07:07:37.150 --> 07:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
and instruction is local
 
07:07:39.990 --> 07:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
control there's Pro there's a name of a
 
07:07:42.670 --> 07:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
program in here or there was I mean you
 
07:07:44.788 --> 07:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned letters okay so that's a
 
07:07:44.798 --> 07:07:46.110 align:start position:0%
mentioned letters okay so that's a
commercial

07:07:46.110 --> 07:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
07:07:49.110 --> 07:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
program but a district may find
 
07:07:53.310 --> 07:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
something from another vendor that meets
 
07:07:56.788 --> 07:07:56.798 align:start position:0%
the same tenants I absolutely agree all
 
07:07:58.910 --> 07:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
of these evidence-based strategies are
 
07:08:01.350 --> 07:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
required in a good reading
 
07:08:04.788 --> 07:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
program should all districts do it yes
 
07:08:07.030 --> 07:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's our place to
 
07:08:09.708 --> 07:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
determine what district te what
 
07:08:13.230 --> 07:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
districts use to teach I mean you can't
 
07:08:16.590 --> 07:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
take any one caned basil program that
 
07:08:19.310 --> 07:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
has these components in it and expect it
 
07:08:21.868 --> 07:08:21.878 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of all the children in
 
07:08:24.708 --> 07:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
first and second grade cuz it's not I
 
07:08:28.350 --> 07:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
mean kids are not all fitting in one box
 
07:08:30.990 --> 07:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
they run the gamut and they learn at
 
07:08:31.000 --> 07:08:32.310 align:start position:0%
they run the gamut and they learn at
different

07:08:32.310 --> 07:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
07:08:34.948 --> 07:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
rates and I can't support something
 
07:08:39.230 --> 07:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's telling the districts what to do
 
07:08:41.070 --> 07:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
maybe their scores are really good with
 
07:08:43.990 --> 07:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
Bal balance literacy I don't know I
 
07:08:45.670 --> 07:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at that but I can tell
 
07:08:49.548 --> 07:08:49.558 align:start position:0%
you that I did find a study that I would
 
07:08:51.628 --> 07:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
place a lot of value in and it's from
 
07:08:54.510 --> 07:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
the PE Research Center and
 
07:08:57.468 --> 07:08:57.478 align:start position:0%
forbs and Annie Casey Foundation which I
 
07:08:59.468 --> 07:08:59.478 align:start position:0%
hope you're all familiar with that New
 
07:09:01.310 --> 07:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the highest literacy rate
 
07:09:05.190 --> 07:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:07.548 --> 07:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
94.2% now I know there's a lot of kids
 
07:09:09.468 --> 07:09:09.478 align:start position:0%
that are struggling in
 
07:09:12.590 --> 07:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
reading and you will always have kids
 
07:09:15.670 --> 07:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
that have difficulty learning reading or
 
07:09:18.868 --> 07:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
math or anything you'll never have 100%
 
07:09:22.388 --> 07:09:22.398 align:start position:0%
is the goal 100% readers the goal was
 
07:09:24.830 --> 07:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
that everybody should have at least the
 
07:09:28.070 --> 07:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
minimum reading skills of a sixth grader
 
07:09:29.868 --> 07:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
so that they can read anything out in
 
07:09:34.510 --> 07:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
the public sector um so again I think
 
07:09:37.350 --> 07:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
this is all great I agree with it all
 
07:09:40.510 --> 07:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen it worked I trained in letters
 
07:09:43.110 --> 07:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
um and I've trained in these these um
 
07:09:45.990 --> 07:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
different modules it works
 
07:09:48.468 --> 07:09:48.478 align:start position:0%
well but sitting on this side of the
 
07:09:52.070 --> 07:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
table it's not my job to tell District B
 
07:09:54.110 --> 07:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
you need to implement this program you
 
07:09:56.590 --> 07:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
need to have these uh professional
 
07:09:58.388 --> 07:09:58.398 align:start position:0%
development activities you need to buy
 
07:10:00.990 --> 07:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
this program not that this says that but
 
07:10:02.310 --> 07:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
it implies
 
07:10:09.310 --> 07:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:13.230 --> 07:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
control thank you uh representative
 
07:10:14.670 --> 07:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
cordelan then representative Miler and
 
07:10:15.788 --> 07:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
07:10:19.990 --> 07:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
leas thank you I I disagree in that we
 
07:10:22.990 --> 07:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
set out anything in local control here B
 
07:10:24.670 --> 07:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
if anything we're setting standards and
 
07:10:27.510 --> 07:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
the standard is evidence-based science
 
07:10:31.430 --> 07:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
of research um science of reading
 
07:10:33.910 --> 07:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
research that is the standard they're
 
07:10:36.948 --> 07:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
free to choose any curriculum that meets
 
07:10:39.830 --> 07:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
those criteria that they want it the
 
07:10:42.788 --> 07:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
bill also instructs the Department of
 
07:10:46.030 --> 07:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
Education to identify appropriate
 
07:10:49.590 --> 07:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
instruction materials from which the um
 
07:10:51.388 --> 07:10:51.398 align:start position:0%
School District can choose whatever ever
 
07:10:53.910 --> 07:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
they want any combination thereof we're
 
07:10:56.230 --> 07:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
not mandating any particular curriculum
 
07:10:58.670 --> 07:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
we're not mandating any kind of
 
07:11:01.150 --> 07:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
07:11:05.548 --> 07:11:05.558 align:start position:0%
um um it it there's nothing no product
 
07:11:10.030 --> 07:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned in here and in in terms of um
 
07:11:12.628 --> 07:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
the uh the screener the Department of
 
07:11:16.270 --> 07:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
Education has already had um a group of
 
07:11:18.590 --> 07:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh Educators and reading Specialists
 
07:11:21.590 --> 07:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
together to talk about screeners um I
 
07:11:26.548 --> 07:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
was on a call uh two nights ago with um
 
07:11:31.388 --> 07:11:31.398 align:start position:0%
um Melissa white and um Kate the
 
07:11:32.670 --> 07:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
specialist from the Department of
 
07:11:36.910 --> 07:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
Education with Carol Tolman um um from
 
07:11:40.190 --> 07:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
who co-authored letters talking about
 
07:11:43.350 --> 07:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
what screeners um were the top screeners
 
07:11:45.270 --> 07:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
and what top screeners that they might
 
07:11:47.868 --> 07:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
want to avoid so they're looking at this
 
07:11:50.070 --> 07:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
already and they're moving in that
 
07:11:50.080 --> 07:11:51.948 align:start position:0%
already and they're moving in that
direction

07:11:51.948 --> 07:11:51.958 align:start position:0%
direction
 
07:11:54.868 --> 07:11:54.878 align:start position:0%
um they have said that they believe that
 
07:11:57.868 --> 07:11:57.878 align:start position:0%
they can find funding for one
 
07:12:01.430 --> 07:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
screener if we want to do it properly
 
07:12:03.830 --> 07:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
with training and
 
07:12:06.150 --> 07:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
support but if we're going to do the
 
07:12:07.750 --> 07:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
provide training and support in the
 
07:12:10.150 --> 07:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
field you know we can't go off and have
 
07:12:11.948 --> 07:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
the department buy three different
 
07:12:14.948 --> 07:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
screeners for them to use and especially
 
07:12:16.910 --> 07:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
if we're going to base any kind of
 
07:12:21.910 --> 07:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
future grants um off of uh combination
 
07:12:25.750 --> 07:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
of screeners so you know that's
 
07:12:28.468 --> 07:12:28.478 align:start position:0%
addressing my view on local control and
 
07:12:31.830 --> 07:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
also the screener issue repr
 
07:12:35.350 --> 07:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
Miler first of all I want to thank
 
07:12:37.868 --> 07:12:37.878 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for bringing
 
07:12:39.548 --> 07:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
this issue before
 
07:12:43.230 --> 07:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
us um I appreciate his
 
07:12:48.468 --> 07:12:48.478 align:start position:0%
passion and his uh work on this
 
07:12:51.070 --> 07:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think anybody in this Comm
 
07:12:53.830 --> 07:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee would disagree that reading is
 
07:12:57.350 --> 07:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
critical for a Student
 
07:13:00.430 --> 07:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
Success and I want to respond to
 
07:13:02.388 --> 07:13:02.398 align:start position:0%
representative leak's comment about the
 
07:13:04.990 --> 07:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
issue of criticizing the department
 
07:13:06.150 --> 07:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
those of us that have been on this
 
07:13:09.110 --> 07:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee have a right to criticize them
 
07:13:11.628 --> 07:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
we we authorized a reading
 
07:13:13.468 --> 07:13:13.478 align:start position:0%
specialist years
 
07:13:16.788 --> 07:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
ago was never filled it was filled by a
 
07:13:19.948 --> 07:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
language arts person not a reading
 
07:13:23.150 --> 07:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
person so there in lies my suspicion
 
07:13:24.430 --> 07:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
about the
 
07:13:27.110 --> 07:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
department this bill is a Christmas tree
 
07:13:31.708 --> 07:13:31.718 align:start position:0%
Bill what I mean by that is that it is
 
07:13:34.430 --> 07:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
massive it's massive in its intent to
 
07:13:37.750 --> 07:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
try to radically change the way that we
 
07:13:39.990 --> 07:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
teach reading in in the school and Glenn
 
07:13:40.000 --> 07:13:41.590 align:start position:0%
teach reading in in the school and Glenn
recognizes

07:13:41.590 --> 07:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
07:13:45.070 --> 07:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
that my concern is is that and I've it's
 
07:13:46.868 --> 07:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
interesting because I I've been
 
07:13:49.310 --> 07:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
intrigued by reading some of the emails
 
07:13:51.830 --> 07:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
that we've gotten from parents who have
 
07:13:54.230 --> 07:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
had children who have struggled I myself
 
07:13:55.708 --> 07:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
was a struggling
 
07:13:59.070 --> 07:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
reader uh and I I'll never forget uh one
 
07:14:01.830 --> 07:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
of my favorite teachers Mr Levine in
 
07:14:04.510 --> 07:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
fourth grade knew that I love to play
 
07:14:06.868 --> 07:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
basketball and he put on the
 
07:14:09.350 --> 07:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
desk backboard
 
07:14:12.150 --> 07:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
magic and that was the book that got me
 
07:14:13.548 --> 07:14:13.558 align:start position:0%
into being a
 
07:14:16.270 --> 07:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
reader there are various ways in which I
 
07:14:19.708 --> 07:14:19.718 align:start position:0%
think represent K Kon has said is that
 
07:14:22.628 --> 07:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
people learn to read
 
07:14:25.110 --> 07:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
and I think it it's the magic of the
 
07:14:27.868 --> 07:14:27.878 align:start position:0%
teacher that tries to identify what
 
07:14:30.830 --> 07:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
those what which arrows in this quiver I
 
07:14:33.750 --> 07:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
need to use to make sure that that
 
07:14:37.388 --> 07:14:37.398 align:start position:0%
student can in fact accomplish a reading
 
07:14:40.190 --> 07:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
competency my concern about this uh
 
07:14:42.670 --> 07:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
representive cordelli is that it seems
 
07:14:45.070 --> 07:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
to have a single focus on an
 
07:14:48.388 --> 07:14:48.398 align:start position:0%
approach that's my concern it's not it's
 
07:14:51.110 --> 07:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
not the issue of the need don't I don't
 
07:14:54.310 --> 07:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
deny that but I'm concerned about that
 
07:14:55.750 --> 07:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
teacher out there that now has been
 
07:14:57.868 --> 07:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
trained in a particular way and has been
 
07:15:01.070 --> 07:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
successful in teaching get this bill now
 
07:15:03.750 --> 07:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
say oh I got to change everything I
 
07:15:05.990 --> 07:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the way we should do
 
07:15:09.590 --> 07:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
things and I we've heard competing we
 
07:15:12.230 --> 07:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
heard competing interest here about
 
07:15:14.990 --> 07:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
approaches to reading I mean I remember
 
07:15:19.388 --> 07:15:19.398 align:start position:0%
getting this long Mis from a UNH teacher
 
07:15:22.070 --> 07:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh professor who basically said you need
 
07:15:25.310 --> 07:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
multiple approaches this is okay as one
 
07:15:28.430 --> 07:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
of the arrows but not the
 
07:15:32.708 --> 07:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
arrow and so my my concern is that I
 
07:15:35.628 --> 07:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
know I know representative cardelli
 
07:15:38.628 --> 07:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
you're impatient and I I I I respect the
 
07:15:41.190 --> 07:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
impatien around this but if we're going
 
07:15:42.830 --> 07:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
to move in this thing it would seem to
 
07:15:45.350 --> 07:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
me that we need to have a more
 
07:15:48.230 --> 07:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive look at this if we're
 
07:15:50.350 --> 07:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
going to go down a particular Road and
 
07:15:52.510 --> 07:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive look where we where
 
07:15:54.830 --> 07:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
we do have the computers come in here
 
07:15:57.310 --> 07:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
and talk about this one works here this
 
07:15:59.910 --> 07:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
one doesn't work here here's why to have
 
07:16:04.230 --> 07:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
a much more a much broader look at how
 
07:16:06.310 --> 07:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
we want to go forward with
 
07:16:10.590 --> 07:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
this I again I respect your work on this
 
07:16:14.110 --> 07:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
good but but I think we need more I I
 
07:16:16.110 --> 07:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
need more I'm not a specialist on this I
 
07:16:18.310 --> 07:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
got to re rely on somebody like Ken
 
07:16:19.948 --> 07:16:19.958 align:start position:0%
who's been out in the field who's who's
 
07:16:21.190 --> 07:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
done this stuff
 
07:16:23.468 --> 07:16:23.478 align:start position:0%
or or other teachers that are around her
 
07:16:25.788 --> 07:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
that done this stuff I'm not I don't
 
07:16:28.750 --> 07:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
know this and so I'm uncomfortable with
 
07:16:31.590 --> 07:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
a single approach and I and I would I
 
07:16:34.788 --> 07:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
would strongly recommend not just a
 
07:16:37.830 --> 07:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
nonsense interim study look at this but
 
07:16:40.030 --> 07:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to look at this issue as a
 
07:16:43.430 --> 07:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
ground as as a foundational look to
 
07:16:44.708 --> 07:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
begin a
 
07:16:48.070 --> 07:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
broader review of what our options are
 
07:16:49.670 --> 07:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
and what we can do and I do have a
 
07:16:52.110 --> 07:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
concern about us
 
07:16:54.868 --> 07:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
dictating from a legislative standpoint
 
07:16:57.510 --> 07:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
we've had a long history here of not
 
07:17:00.350 --> 07:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
trying to dictate curriculum from this
 
07:17:03.468 --> 07:17:03.478 align:start position:0%
committee to a local school district so
 
07:17:05.548 --> 07:17:05.558 align:start position:0%
that's another concern that I have but I
 
07:17:07.070 --> 07:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
would hope that we would take the work
 
07:17:09.510 --> 07:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's been started here and try to
 
07:17:12.190 --> 07:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
perfect it in a much higher level than
 
07:17:14.310 --> 07:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
just this this is the first time we've
 
07:17:16.070 --> 07:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
looked at something like this other than
 
07:17:18.430 --> 07:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
dyslexic thing and we've had success on
 
07:17:21.388 --> 07:17:21.398 align:start position:0%
the dyslexic bill that we put forward
 
07:17:24.110 --> 07:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
and so that that's my concern I guess of
 
07:17:27.548 --> 07:17:27.558 align:start position:0%
of uh OTP this the way it is and would
 
07:17:29.910 --> 07:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
really look to more of a longer term
 
07:17:32.350 --> 07:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
interim study look at this I know it's
 
07:17:34.350 --> 07:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
putting back I know it doesn't deal with
 
07:17:38.190 --> 07:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
the impatience of it but um I I just I
 
07:17:39.590 --> 07:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just uncomfortable with the
 
07:17:42.388 --> 07:17:42.398 align:start position:0%
massiveness of this right now thank you
 
07:17:43.868 --> 07:17:43.878 align:start position:0%
again thank you again Glenn for your
 
07:17:47.590 --> 07:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:50.628 --> 07:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
next rep cordelli basically said what I
 
07:17:55.388 --> 07:17:55.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:58.910 --> 07:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Hall thank you Mr
 
07:18:02.430 --> 07:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
chair I have a question has a doe done
 
07:18:04.830 --> 07:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
much for the different districts to
 
07:18:07.510 --> 07:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
promote the science of reading do we
 
07:18:10.708 --> 07:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
know what they have
 
07:18:15.270 --> 07:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
done um they are uh they have a a a
 
07:18:18.150 --> 07:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
specialist uh Kate mcaffrey who's going
 
07:18:21.230 --> 07:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
around from District to District um
 
07:18:24.270 --> 07:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
they have made the letters of program
 
07:18:27.030 --> 07:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
available for free using Federal funding
 
07:18:29.628 --> 07:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
um to teachers um unfortunately that
 
07:18:32.628 --> 07:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
funding runs out the end of this year um
 
07:18:34.788 --> 07:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
My Hope was that you know early if we
 
07:18:37.590 --> 07:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
had been able to do something um last
 
07:18:38.868 --> 07:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
year that we could put something in the
 
07:18:41.430 --> 07:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
budget in that regard
 
07:18:41.440 --> 07:18:42.948 align:start position:0%
budget in that regard
um

07:18:42.948 --> 07:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:48.670 --> 07:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
um but yeah um the idea is that and with
 
07:18:51.070 --> 07:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
the micro credentials that I just
 
07:18:53.070 --> 07:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they are just starting up
 
07:18:57.750 --> 07:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
to um offer um uh these micro
 
07:19:01.388 --> 07:19:01.398 align:start position:0%
credentials um to teachers going through
 
07:19:04.270 --> 07:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
um uh the process of learning um this
 
07:19:06.948 --> 07:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
evidence-based research and teaching in
 
07:19:09.670 --> 07:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
that method
 
07:19:12.788 --> 07:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
followup so has it been a favorable
 
07:19:14.190 --> 07:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
arisma does it sound like the districts
 
07:19:16.910 --> 07:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
are saying oh yeah this is great or what
 
07:19:19.070 --> 07:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
is the response other than I understand
 
07:19:21.230 --> 07:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
the microc credentialing but
 
07:19:26.150 --> 07:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
overall um all I can point to is um the
 
07:19:27.590 --> 07:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
number of people who were in the
 
07:19:30.030 --> 07:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
professional development uh session that
 
07:19:32.948 --> 07:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
I attended in Londoner the room was full
 
07:19:34.830 --> 07:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think there was a vacant
 
07:19:34.840 --> 07:19:36.590 align:start position:0%
I don't think there was a vacant
seat

07:19:36.590 --> 07:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
seat
 
07:19:40.270 --> 07:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
um I was the only interloper um if you
 
07:19:40.280 --> 07:19:41.948 align:start position:0%
um I was the only interloper um if you
will

07:19:41.948 --> 07:19:41.958 align:start position:0%
will
 
07:19:41.958 --> 07:19:43.590 align:start position:0%
will
um

07:19:43.590 --> 07:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:47.670 --> 07:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
um we have uh gotten today a petition
 
07:19:51.030 --> 07:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's um filled with teachers
 
07:19:54.468 --> 07:19:54.478 align:start position:0%
um on that I've worked with um many
 
07:19:59.990 --> 07:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
teachers and um I point out that the um
 
07:20:04.070 --> 07:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
the chair the tri chairs of decoding
 
07:20:07.510 --> 07:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
dyslexia wrote to us um last night
 
07:20:10.310 --> 07:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
indicating their support for this bill
 
07:20:14.468 --> 07:20:14.478 align:start position:0%
the um uh chair of the New England

Association has been working with me for

weeks on on this bill um so that's my um
 
07:20:30.270 --> 07:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
firsthand view of of things you further
 
07:20:33.868 --> 07:20:33.878 align:start position:0%
discussion I think we're represent beler
 
07:20:36.628 --> 07:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'll be brief um
 
07:20:38.070 --> 07:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
i' I've outlined some of the concerns
 
07:20:39.590 --> 07:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
I've had before I don't need to rehash
 
07:20:41.670 --> 07:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
all of that right now my concerns do
 
07:20:44.070 --> 07:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
stand um but I also wanted to speak to
 
07:20:47.468 --> 07:20:47.478 align:start position:0%
on page for the lower part I I have some
 
07:20:48.708 --> 07:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm totally on board with
 
07:20:51.230 --> 07:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
the concept of
 
07:20:53.990 --> 07:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
telling schools that we need to be
 
07:20:56.310 --> 07:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
following where good science and good
 
07:20:59.548 --> 07:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
evidence is leading us but I'm I'm also
 
07:21:01.788 --> 07:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
deeply uncomfortable with the idea that
 
07:21:04.750 --> 07:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
we would enshrine in law the current
 
07:21:06.628 --> 07:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
findings of what we believe science to
 
07:21:08.750 --> 07:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
be because the very nature of science is
 
07:21:11.430 --> 07:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's falsifiable and things can change
 
07:21:14.070 --> 07:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
in time and I I think we need to take a
 
07:21:16.590 --> 07:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
different approach to that thank you
 
07:21:19.910 --> 07:21:19.920 align:start position:0%

rsas that is contrary to work we've done

6 which
 
07:28:06.548 --> 07:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
says this is basically Town
 
07:28:09.110 --> 07:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
tuition if there's no public school for
 
07:28:10.830 --> 07:28:10.840 align:start position:0%

program by the school
 
07:28:25.468 --> 07:28:25.478 align:start position:0%
board and it goes on from there so we've
 
07:28:31.350 --> 07:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
already changed the law to reflect that
 
07:28:33.510 --> 07:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
for Town tuition purposes the school
 
07:28:37.708 --> 07:28:37.718 align:start position:0%

school um what the bill attempts to do
 
07:28:48.150 --> 07:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
is repeal the statute that has the um
 
07:28:51.830 --> 07:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
old language um preventing Contracting
 
07:28:55.708 --> 07:28:55.718 align:start position:0%
with non- sectarian uh private schools
 
07:28:58.590 --> 07:28:58.600 align:start position:0%

multiple occasions um ruled
 
07:29:04.150 --> 07:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court
 
07:29:09.270 --> 07:29:09.280 align:start position:0%

the um length of time that districts
 
07:29:27.990 --> 07:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
needed to provide uh had a duty to you
 
07:29:29.868 --> 07:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
are you going to introduce the amendment
 
07:29:33.030 --> 07:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
oh sorry my first
 
07:29:38.270 --> 07:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
Rio okay so the amendment is
 
07:29:40.750 --> 07:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
um number 242
 
07:29:44.948 --> 07:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
24h sorry okay is s a
 
07:29:48.468 --> 07:29:48.478 align:start position:0%
second was that you represent Damon okay
 
07:29:51.388 --> 07:29:51.398 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay sorry all right so the
 
07:29:53.468 --> 07:29:53.478 align:start position:0%
first uh time we were introduced to this
 
07:29:55.308 --> 07:29:55.318 align:start position:0%
bill it was pointed out that we were
 
07:29:58.830 --> 07:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
just amending to accommodate the uh
 
07:30:01.030 --> 07:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
changes in the special ed law that was
 
07:30:05.190 --> 07:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
through the age 21 so the amendment in
 
07:30:07.030 --> 07:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
the original
 
07:30:11.030 --> 07:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
um Bill had the word inclusive and we've
 
07:30:13.590 --> 07:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
kind of done that and the other bills a
 
07:30:15.510 --> 07:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
deal with special ed because instead of
 
07:30:18.150 --> 07:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
going up to the 21st birthday it's now
 
07:30:20.430 --> 07:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
really up to the 22nd birthday so that's
 
07:30:24.030 --> 07:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
what this corrects but my Amendment does
 
07:30:26.270 --> 07:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
want to correct that to age
 
07:30:30.070 --> 07:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
22 uh but it does not repeal 1891 I feel
 
07:30:33.230 --> 07:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
that manifest educational hardship is
 
07:30:35.030 --> 07:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
again one of those issues that's local
 
07:30:38.270 --> 07:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
control where a local school board can
 
07:30:42.110 --> 07:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
determine where a student goes it can be
 
07:30:45.708 --> 07:30:45.718 align:start position:0%
non sectarian private it can be monor it
 
07:30:48.350 --> 07:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
can be any place that that school board
 
07:30:51.270 --> 07:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
decides to send that child no matter
 
07:30:53.708 --> 07:30:53.718 align:start position:0%
where um as long as they're accepted in
 
07:30:56.510 --> 07:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
the receiving School District or school
 
07:31:00.190 --> 07:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't see any need um to repeal a
 
07:31:02.030 --> 07:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship which
 
07:31:04.670 --> 07:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
again is a local school board decision
 
07:31:06.230 --> 07:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
but that we do need to make the
 
07:31:08.388 --> 07:31:08.398 align:start position:0%
amendment to make sure that we have a
 
07:31:13.628 --> 07:31:13.638 align:start position:0%
duty to provide um up to age 22 until
 
07:31:16.110 --> 07:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
the student turns 22 so that's my
 
07:31:18.350 --> 07:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment further
 
07:31:18.360 --> 07:31:19.948 align:start position:0%
Amendment further
discussion

07:31:19.948 --> 07:31:19.958 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
07:31:22.230 --> 07:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelli yes um
 
07:31:23.750 --> 07:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative you are correcting that
 
07:31:26.510 --> 07:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
this does revise that one section of St
 
07:31:29.230 --> 07:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
statute is been there also was missed in
 
07:31:32.230 --> 07:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
relation to age uh 21 inclusive um in
 
07:31:35.388 --> 07:31:35.398 align:start position:0%
addition to the repeal um but um it's
 
07:31:39.830 --> 07:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
really the um section of law for Town
 
07:31:42.590 --> 07:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
tuition under manifest education chart
 
07:31:46.430 --> 07:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
hardship that has been revised um a
 
07:31:49.788 --> 07:31:49.798 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago so that it can uh
 
07:31:54.388 --> 07:31:54.398 align:start position:0%
they can tuition to any private school
 
07:31:57.750 --> 07:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
um if if any
 
07:31:59.910 --> 07:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
um School
 
07:32:03.070 --> 07:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
Board refuses to contract with a non
 
07:32:05.830 --> 07:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
sectarian private school based on
 
07:32:07.830 --> 07:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions they'll be
 
07:32:11.308 --> 07:32:11.318 align:start position:0%
immediately in court the Supreme Court
 
07:32:15.830 --> 07:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
in Espinosa versus Montana um uh caen
 
07:32:19.030 --> 07:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
versus Mak over in Maine just um uh a
 
07:32:22.590 --> 07:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
year year ago both revie uh said said
 
07:32:24.468 --> 07:32:24.478 align:start position:0%
that The Establishment Clause says you
 
07:32:24.478 --> 07:32:26.308 align:start position:0%
that The Establishment Clause says you
cannot

07:32:26.308 --> 07:32:26.318 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
07:32:29.190 --> 07:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
exclude a non
 
07:32:32.270 --> 07:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
sectarian School a religious school if
 
07:32:35.350 --> 07:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
you do any Contracting with any private
 
07:32:35.360 --> 07:32:37.468 align:start position:0%
you do any Contracting with any private
school

07:32:37.468 --> 07:32:37.478 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:32:41.670 --> 07:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
07:32:44.230 --> 07:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
you're by leaving this in
 
07:32:47.788 --> 07:32:47.798 align:start position:0%
statute um it's I think what did I call
 
07:32:49.948 --> 07:32:49.958 align:start position:0%
it um a dead letter
 
07:32:52.430 --> 07:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
issue it's a dead letter section of the
 
07:32:55.750 --> 07:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
law as the um New Hampshire Supreme
 
07:33:00.948 --> 07:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
Court um has uh ained in that it's
 
07:33:04.030 --> 07:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
statute that cannot be enforced because
 
07:33:05.788 --> 07:33:05.798 align:start position:0%
of the US Supreme Court
 
07:33:07.948 --> 07:33:07.958 align:start position:0%
decisions um they called it a dead
 
07:33:09.670 --> 07:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
letter um
 
07:33:12.590 --> 07:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
provision and that's what we would be um
 
07:33:13.830 --> 07:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
leaving in
 
07:33:16.590 --> 07:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
statute further
 
07:33:19.190 --> 07:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
discussion yes represent luno yeah
 
07:33:21.830 --> 07:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
thanks so a question on on that so are
 
07:33:25.708 --> 07:33:25.718 align:start position:0%
you saying that public school boards
 
07:33:28.948 --> 07:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
have to contract with with religious
 
07:33:30.708 --> 07:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
schools they have no choice but to
 
07:33:34.070 --> 07:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
contract religious yes no they have
 
07:33:36.548 --> 07:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
Choice yeah but me yeah they can
 
07:33:40.510 --> 07:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
contract with but to say you cannot
 
07:33:43.830 --> 07:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
contract with a religious school that's
 
07:33:45.788 --> 07:33:45.798 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because what you said
 
07:33:49.190 --> 07:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
was right if a school board did not
 
07:33:51.270 --> 07:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
contract with relig with a religious
 
07:33:53.548 --> 07:33:53.558 align:start position:0%
school they would be hul in the court
 
07:33:56.990 --> 07:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
right away they can contract with they
 
07:33:58.990 --> 07:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to contract with correct
 
07:34:01.670 --> 07:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
relig yes if I if I said that I misspoke
 
07:34:05.230 --> 07:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay and and and then my other uh
 
07:34:07.270 --> 07:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
question question is because I I think
 
07:34:09.590 --> 07:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
on the top part
 
07:34:11.750 --> 07:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
07:34:15.350 --> 07:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced which the the
 
07:34:17.788 --> 07:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
cascaden amendment does not touch leaves
 
07:34:21.830 --> 07:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
in place the 21 inclusive um currently
 
07:34:23.948 --> 07:34:23.958 align:start position:0%
it just says age 21 doesn't have the
 
07:34:26.628 --> 07:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
word inclusive in there so under federal
 
07:34:28.708 --> 07:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
law the fact that New Hampshire law is
 
07:34:31.510 --> 07:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
inconsistent doesn't really matter um is
 
07:34:33.030 --> 07:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
that right I mean that sort of cleanup
 
07:34:36.350 --> 07:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
language the inclusive we've changed
 
07:34:38.308 --> 07:34:38.318 align:start position:0%
that we changed it elsewhere right right
 
07:34:39.910 --> 07:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
I know I know we have I've been involved
 
07:34:42.670 --> 07:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
in that right so this is right to bring
 
07:34:46.150 --> 07:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
this uh section of the statutes in uh
 
07:34:48.110 --> 07:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
alignment with other sections that we
 
07:34:50.388 --> 07:34:50.398 align:start position:0%
already cleaned federal law and federal
 
07:34:52.388 --> 07:34:52.398 align:start position:0%
law and federal law yes well federal law
 
07:34:55.430 --> 07:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
says um you don't have to do it to make
 
07:34:59.510 --> 07:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
it 22 but it's a a state option to make
 
07:35:01.750 --> 07:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
it 22 and Most states are moving in that
 
07:35:04.270 --> 07:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
direction I think most all New England
 
07:35:06.388 --> 07:35:06.398 align:start position:0%
has done that okay
 
07:35:09.230 --> 07:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
thanks further
 
07:35:13.270 --> 07:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
discussion not seeing any so we have a a

2417h go ahead represent thank you um
 
07:41:41.990 --> 07:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
basically this uh
 
07:41:45.670 --> 07:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment um tightens up the language of
 
07:41:49.670 --> 07:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and that um School
 
07:41:53.150 --> 07:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
Board shall publish uh a complete list
 
07:41:56.510 --> 07:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
of each position title along with the
 
07:41:58.670 --> 07:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
annual or hourly
 
07:42:01.910 --> 07:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
salary in addition um there is a report
 
07:42:04.468 --> 07:42:04.478 align:start position:0%
that also is coming around that each
 
07:42:07.230 --> 07:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
district currently also fills out for
 
07:42:09.350 --> 07:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and I
 
07:42:11.388 --> 07:42:11.398 align:start position:0%
thought would it would be instructable
 
07:42:13.670 --> 07:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
to have that information posted along
 
07:42:15.948 --> 07:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
with the salary information for each
 
07:42:19.670 --> 07:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
position on their website
 
07:42:22.708 --> 07:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
um the idea is
 
07:42:25.868 --> 07:42:25.878 align:start position:0%
twofold um I I think it's I think will
 
07:42:29.270 --> 07:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
bear be very interesting um to see what
 
07:42:32.190 --> 07:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
the salaries are to see um what
 
07:42:34.910 --> 07:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
administrator positions there are we've
 
07:42:37.670 --> 07:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
heard about the growth of administrative
 
07:42:39.910 --> 07:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
positions as opposed to teacher
 
07:42:43.510 --> 07:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
positions and the pay um going to
 
07:42:47.910 --> 07:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
administrators versus uh teachers um I
 
07:42:50.868 --> 07:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
think that be instructive for uh
 
07:42:54.070 --> 07:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
everybody us included um and the public
 
07:42:56.590 --> 07:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
in each district um but also I I think
 
07:42:58.430 --> 07:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
it might be instructive for the
 
07:43:02.430 --> 07:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
teachers to see their salaries compared
 
07:43:05.548 --> 07:43:05.558 align:start position:0%
with the administrator salaries um you
 
07:43:07.590 --> 07:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
know we've heard about teacher
 
07:43:10.388 --> 07:43:10.398 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and everything else um you
 
07:43:12.990 --> 07:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
know maybe show having the teachers
 
07:43:15.430 --> 07:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
really see what they're getting paid as
 
07:43:18.388 --> 07:43:18.398 align:start position:0%
opposed to others are getting paid um
 
07:43:22.948 --> 07:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
you know might um lend some uh Credence
 
07:43:26.350 --> 07:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
to um their contract discussions next
 
07:43:29.308 --> 07:43:29.318 align:start position:0%
time around so I I I'm putting this
 
07:43:32.308 --> 07:43:32.318 align:start position:0%
forward with basically a two-fold
 
07:43:34.910 --> 07:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
purpose um thank
 
07:43:39.948 --> 07:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:42.830 --> 07:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
discussion yes represent pel yes our
 
07:43:46.030 --> 07:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
school district um actually does List
 
07:43:49.190 --> 07:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
names along with the annual salary
 
07:43:51.110 --> 07:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
however it's not listed by position it's
 
07:43:53.430 --> 07:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
listed alphabetically and I actually
 
07:43:55.670 --> 07:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
think that that's unfair because now I
 
07:43:57.230 --> 07:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
know what how much money my neighbor is
 
07:43:59.070 --> 07:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
making whether or not I want to know
 
07:44:02.750 --> 07:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
that if I wanted to look at the list um
 
07:44:04.750 --> 07:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
but I think this would be really helpful
 
07:44:07.708 --> 07:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
um in terms of understanding how much is
 
07:44:09.948 --> 07:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
spent on Administration versus actual
 
07:44:09.958 --> 07:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
spent on Administration versus actual
student

07:44:12.230 --> 07:44:12.240 align:start position:0%

07:44:14.628 --> 07:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
instruction representative
 
07:44:18.150 --> 07:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
moo thank you very much Mr chair so um
 
07:44:21.430 --> 07:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know I I appreciate that um that the
 
07:44:24.830 --> 07:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
um that the prime sponsor wants us to be
 
07:44:26.708 --> 07:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
able to have access to that in this
 
07:44:28.670 --> 07:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
information that we may find it useful
 
07:44:30.590 --> 07:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
but in fact we do have access to that
 
07:44:32.628 --> 07:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
information you're just going over to
 
07:44:34.230 --> 07:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
the um Department of
 
07:44:38.868 --> 07:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
Education uh website um look up the
 
07:44:41.510 --> 07:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
administrator Sol reports I can read
 
07:44:43.750 --> 07:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
through kentu Valley SAU office
 
07:44:43.760 --> 07:44:45.548 align:start position:0%
through kentu Valley SAU office
superintendent

07:44:45.548 --> 07:44:45.558 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
07:44:48.948 --> 07:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
$171,600 a year Kent Valley Au office
 
07:44:51.868 --> 07:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent 14196 and you
 
07:44:53.510 --> 07:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
can go right down and it's got every
 
07:44:56.548 --> 07:44:56.558 align:start position:0%
District right on it and and literally
 
07:44:59.628 --> 07:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
it if I was curious if I wanted to find
 
07:45:01.590 --> 07:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
that information you're seconds away
 
07:45:05.388 --> 07:45:05.398 align:start position:0%
from it um right now and uh so not only
 
07:45:08.110 --> 07:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
is the information available through the
 
07:45:11.308 --> 07:45:11.318 align:start position:0%
um uh through the uh Department of Ed
 
07:45:14.510 --> 07:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
but um but my understanding at least my
 
07:45:17.110 --> 07:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of our school district um
 
07:45:19.350 --> 07:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
where I'm you know served his chair for
 
07:45:22.670 --> 07:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
8 years and was on it 12 years um uh we
 
07:45:25.670 --> 07:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
make that information available uh to uh
 
07:45:28.150 --> 07:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
anybody that uh that comes in and and
 
07:45:30.670 --> 07:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
asks for it so and of course you know in
 
07:45:32.628 --> 07:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
a small school district a lot of
 
07:45:34.750 --> 07:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
teachers the position identifies the
 
07:45:38.548 --> 07:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
teacher um so it's a little bit of a of
 
07:45:42.510 --> 07:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
a you know you know practice that
 
07:45:46.548 --> 07:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
exposes uh uh identifies I should say uh
 
07:45:48.670 --> 07:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
specific people but that's part of
 
07:45:50.388 --> 07:45:50.398 align:start position:0%
transparency and that's part of uh
 
07:45:52.110 --> 07:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
working as a public
 
07:45:56.110 --> 07:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:59.230 --> 07:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
leus the administrator superintendence
 
07:46:00.750 --> 07:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
whatever that are on there doesn't
 
07:46:02.590 --> 07:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
include all of the things that are on
 
07:46:07.670 --> 07:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
this form because one of one of one of
 
07:46:11.308 --> 07:46:11.318 align:start position:0%
my constituents specifically asked if
 
07:46:13.388 --> 07:46:13.398 align:start position:0%
they could how they would find out all
 
07:46:14.948 --> 07:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
the different positions and what they
 
07:46:18.628 --> 07:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
were paid and um I didn't know that the
 
07:46:21.948 --> 07:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
letters a2d were what I needed and a lot
 
07:46:24.388 --> 07:46:24.398 align:start position:0%
of constituents don't so they should be
 
07:46:27.030 --> 07:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
able to see it without having to know
 
07:46:30.990 --> 07:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
a2d um but no it was totally
 
07:46:33.350 --> 07:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
insufficient for what we were trying to
 
07:46:35.190 --> 07:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
find yes we got the
 
07:46:37.948 --> 07:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
superintendant ETC but we did not get
 
07:46:39.708 --> 07:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
all of the rest of the people like the
 
07:46:43.670 --> 07:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
pr person and the Dei person and all
 
07:46:46.670 --> 07:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
those other people we couldn't find them
 
07:46:49.190 --> 07:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
and we had no idea how much they were be
 
07:46:52.948 --> 07:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
being paid or anything and that is part
 
07:46:56.510 --> 07:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
of the the structure and the money
 
07:46:59.750 --> 07:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's being spent so I think this is
 
07:47:01.868 --> 07:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
great because now we get to see all of
 
07:47:06.308 --> 07:47:06.318 align:start position:0%
them not just those few thank you I I
 
07:47:08.948 --> 07:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
have a a concern and and and this is the
 
07:47:11.308 --> 07:47:11.318 align:start position:0%
one bill I do have a concern on a lot of
 
07:47:14.548 --> 07:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
bills but I brought in I believe when it
 
07:47:17.030 --> 07:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
was introduced and showed people the
 
07:47:19.548 --> 07:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
annual report from town of
 
07:47:23.308 --> 07:47:23.318 align:start position:0%
havil it lists every
 
07:47:26.430 --> 07:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
employee with their positions and the
 
07:47:28.030 --> 07:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money that they're receiving
 
07:47:29.990 --> 07:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
for that position
 
07:47:33.468 --> 07:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
annually and we've been doing that ever
 
07:47:36.230 --> 07:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
since I've lived in that Community I I
 
07:47:39.468 --> 07:47:39.478 align:start position:0%
think this is this can be done because
 
07:47:41.628 --> 07:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
their Town's doing it uh I can't say
 
07:47:43.350 --> 07:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's being done throughout this entire
 
07:47:45.750 --> 07:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
state but I know that in my particular
 
07:47:48.910 --> 07:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
town this information is published
 
07:47:52.708 --> 07:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
annually and used at the school meeting
 
07:47:56.270 --> 07:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
or at the town meeting oftentimes used
 
07:47:58.750 --> 07:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
all these teachers are overpaid you know
 
07:48:04.270 --> 07:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
$8,000,000 a year uh it's it's uh it's
 
07:48:09.510 --> 07:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:11.990 --> 07:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
needed represent
 
07:48:14.750 --> 07:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
cell U when transparency was mentioned
 
07:48:16.670 --> 07:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I am all for
 
07:48:18.468 --> 07:48:18.478 align:start position:0%
transparency um
 
07:48:20.910 --> 07:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
um I feel like the more places this
 
07:48:23.430 --> 07:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
information could be provided the better
 
07:48:26.670 --> 07:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
if it's easier to find all the better so
 
07:48:28.750 --> 07:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
I I support this some people may not
 
07:48:30.750 --> 07:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
know to go to the Department of
 
07:48:35.270 --> 07:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
Education um maybe the I know um some
 
07:48:37.708 --> 07:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
towns have different ways of putting
 
07:48:39.750 --> 07:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
their annual reports online some towns
 
07:48:42.788 --> 07:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
don't put them on there at all um but
 
07:48:45.070 --> 07:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm all for the the more places you
 
07:48:46.510 --> 07:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
can put this information the better
 
07:48:49.190 --> 07:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
because I think it is good to see the
 
07:48:52.388 --> 07:48:52.398 align:start position:0%
difference in uh administrative salaries
 
07:48:54.830 --> 07:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
how much is going towards that um and
 
07:48:57.750 --> 07:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
how many positions there might be maybe
 
07:48:59.468 --> 07:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
there are too many and maybe that'll
 
07:49:02.150 --> 07:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
show that um and how that compares to
 
07:49:06.308 --> 07:49:06.318 align:start position:0%
what teachers are making um
 
07:49:09.388 --> 07:49:09.398 align:start position:0%
so further represent dry and then
 
07:49:11.150 --> 07:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
represent hner thank you Mr chairman I
 
07:49:14.190 --> 07:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um example from your town
 
07:49:16.150 --> 07:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
in our town exactly the same thing
 
07:49:19.590 --> 07:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
happens every cemetery worker
 
07:49:21.868 --> 07:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
instruction worker sound
 
07:49:24.308 --> 07:49:24.318 align:start position:0%
administrator uh assistant Librarian Is
 
07:49:27.788 --> 07:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
on uh with the salary and a name um none
 
07:49:30.270 --> 07:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
of the teachers are it's a graph you
 
07:49:33.708 --> 07:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
have to look at what the teacher studied
 
07:49:35.070 --> 07:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
where they went to school what degree
 
07:49:37.070 --> 07:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
they have find out where it is do the
 
07:49:38.670 --> 07:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
math to compute how long they've been
 
07:49:41.070 --> 07:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
and try to find out where they fall on a
 
07:49:44.430 --> 07:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
a grid scale um it's completely obtuse
 
07:49:46.990 --> 07:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
and nobody uses it uh I don't know why
 
07:49:49.670 --> 07:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
we have one set of uh employees that are
 
07:49:52.548 --> 07:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
are transparent to the letter and and
 
07:49:55.430 --> 07:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:59.430 --> 07:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
all further to refence N Tanner um
 
07:50:01.990 --> 07:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
several times during my teaching career
 
07:50:04.510 --> 07:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh when some people thought it was going
 
07:50:07.150 --> 07:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
to be dis disruptive to everybody
 
07:50:09.388 --> 07:50:09.398 align:start position:0%
because I think that's why um it was
 
07:50:11.830 --> 07:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
done all our names and and salaries were
 
07:50:15.468 --> 07:50:15.478 align:start position:0%
published in the local paper and the
 
07:50:17.070 --> 07:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
surprising thing was that a lot of
 
07:50:19.150 --> 07:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
people had the the same thing as as
 
07:50:20.510 --> 07:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative petronel they were
 
07:50:22.670 --> 07:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
surprised what their neighbors made or
 
07:50:26.708 --> 07:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
didn't make um but for what good does
 
07:50:29.510 --> 07:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
this do and that's that's does it help
 
07:50:32.230 --> 07:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
Public Schools does it help uh anything
 
07:50:36.590 --> 07:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
is it an added regulation um certainly
 
07:50:40.670 --> 07:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
91a they could find out um there's also
 
07:50:42.590 --> 07:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
they just have to go to the SAU office
 
07:50:45.030 --> 07:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
and the SAU office will give them the
 
07:50:47.150 --> 07:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
salaries and and the names of the people
 
07:50:50.270 --> 07:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
that have we're public employees our
 
07:50:53.628 --> 07:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
information is public information um to
 
07:50:57.628 --> 07:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
put it out in the in the in the paper
 
07:50:59.990 --> 07:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
like it was was as I said more
 
07:51:01.948 --> 07:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
disruptive than it than it did any good
 
07:51:04.548 --> 07:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
and and so what's the good of doing this
 
07:51:07.868 --> 07:51:07.878 align:start position:0%
what what is the ultimate intent or goal
 
07:51:11.230 --> 07:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
of publishing all these names and
 
07:51:14.830 --> 07:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:18.430 --> 07:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
leus I think part of the intent is is
 
07:51:20.150 --> 07:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
Teachers aren't paid
 
07:51:22.708 --> 07:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
enough and people don't realize how much
 
07:51:24.910 --> 07:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
they're not paid and the teachers don't
 
07:51:28.430 --> 07:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
realize where the money is going and so
 
07:51:30.190 --> 07:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
we have
 
07:51:33.548 --> 07:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
administrators we have Dei Specialists
 
07:51:35.548 --> 07:51:35.558 align:start position:0%
and PR people who are making more money
 
07:51:38.230 --> 07:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
than the teachers and I think the idea
 
07:51:40.030 --> 07:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
is to get it out there and make it
 
07:51:42.590 --> 07:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
public where all of that money is going
 
07:51:44.868 --> 07:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
and yes maybe the teachers need a raise
 
07:51:46.788 --> 07:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
and maybe yes we need to get rid of some
 
07:51:48.990 --> 07:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
of those other positions so they can get
 
07:51:49.000 --> 07:51:51.468 align:start position:0%
of those other positions so they can get
a

07:51:51.468 --> 07:51:51.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:54.190 --> 07:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
raise further
 
07:51:56.830 --> 07:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
discussion yes representative MCD thank
 
07:52:00.230 --> 07:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I was thinking in the
 
07:52:01.788 --> 07:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
interest of maybe a larger School
 
07:52:03.590 --> 07:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
District where there are multiple
 
07:52:05.628 --> 07:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
positions I mean multiple people filling
 
07:52:07.708 --> 07:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
same position for example kindergarten
 
07:52:09.230 --> 07:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
teacher and you have more than one or
 
07:52:11.270 --> 07:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
for any position and there might be
 
07:52:13.150 --> 07:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
different salaries among them in this
 
07:52:15.270 --> 07:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
bill would they be listed as you know
 
07:52:17.030 --> 07:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
kindergarten teacher one kindergarten
 
07:52:20.468 --> 07:52:20.478 align:start position:0%
teacher too or how exactly would that
 
07:52:22.750 --> 07:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
work that would be up to them but I
 
07:52:24.708 --> 07:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
would uh Envision something like that
 
07:52:27.868 --> 07:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:32.628 --> 07:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:36.990 --> 07:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:40.350 --> 07:52:40.360 align:start position:0%

know okay um I I believe we discussed
 
07:59:29.350 --> 07:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
this um a little bit um earlier but uh
 
07:59:33.270 --> 07:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
this is the result of work with um the
 
07:59:35.750 --> 07:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
department of motor
 
07:59:35.760 --> 07:59:38.110 align:start position:0%

07:59:38.110 --> 07:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
07:59:43.150 --> 07:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
um they um advis that the um School
 
07:59:45.628 --> 07:59:45.638 align:start position:0%
transportation vehicle be included in
 
07:59:47.830 --> 07:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
these statutes and also with the
 
07:59:52.070 --> 07:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education who um uh
 
07:59:56.070 --> 07:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
recommended the uh addition on the uh
 
07:59:58.868 --> 07:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
last page page three of relation to
 
08:00:02.670 --> 08:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
background checks um this is Niche
 
08:00:05.150 --> 08:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh it's not meant to
 
08:00:07.308 --> 08:00:07.318 align:start position:0%
replace yellow buses or anything like
 
08:00:09.910 --> 08:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
that it's niche Transportation foster
 
08:00:13.430 --> 08:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
care special needs homeless children in
 
08:00:17.670 --> 08:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
particular um um
 
08:00:20.110 --> 08:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation ISS issues that come up
 
08:00:22.110 --> 08:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
during the course of the year after bus
 
08:00:26.070 --> 08:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
routes have already been set um I was at
 
08:00:31.708 --> 08:00:31.718 align:start position:0%
a uh DCF foster care conference um I
 
08:00:33.670 --> 08:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
think three Saturdays ago and
 
08:00:37.910 --> 08:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
participated in a panel um and uh the uh
 
08:00:40.430 --> 08:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
people in the foster care uh Community
 
08:00:44.110 --> 08:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
were very interested in this um some of
 
08:00:46.708 --> 08:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
the stories are amazing in terms of long
 
08:00:49.628 --> 08:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
long term placements with a foster care
 
08:00:53.830 --> 08:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
family and within 12 hours notice the
 
08:00:55.868 --> 08:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
child is taken away from them and put in
 
08:00:58.030 --> 08:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
a different placement and that new
 
08:01:00.910 --> 08:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
school district then has to provide um
 
08:01:02.910 --> 08:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
arrange for transportation to get that
 
08:01:05.788 --> 08:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
child to school so I think that this
 
08:01:08.430 --> 08:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
helps in a number of areas um we spent
 
08:01:11.430 --> 08:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
hours working with uh uh the
 
08:01:13.868 --> 08:01:13.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner who was here earlier with
 
08:01:15.590 --> 08:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh two other Troopers who were involved
 
08:01:19.388 --> 08:01:19.398 align:start position:0%
in that meeting and the school bus um
 
08:01:23.548 --> 08:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
Trooper um uh in charge basically who
 
08:01:26.150 --> 08:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
cannot be here today because he's uh
 
08:01:30.708 --> 08:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
undergoing surgery um but um that's uh
 
08:01:32.868 --> 08:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
why I'm bringing forward this bill and
 
08:01:32.878 --> 08:01:34.030 align:start position:0%
why I'm bringing forward this bill and
the

08:01:34.030 --> 08:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:01:36.830 --> 08:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
background further
 
08:01:39.750 --> 08:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
discussion yes represent cascaden I just
 
08:01:41.708 --> 08:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
have a question on how different is this
 
08:01:45.270 --> 08:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
from the statute on multi-use
 
08:01:48.150 --> 08:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles um it was felt that it was
 
08:01:50.670 --> 08:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
sufficiently dis uh difference and
 
08:01:52.948 --> 08:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
you'll see the definition on line seven
 
08:01:55.548 --> 08:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
and eight um there would be P your
 
08:02:01.150 --> 08:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
button um I'm sorry thank you um uh
 
08:02:03.150 --> 08:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
there will be several companies who are
 
08:02:05.070 --> 08:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
interested in providing this service in
 
08:02:08.468 --> 08:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that will hire um drivers
 
08:02:11.708 --> 08:02:11.718 align:start position:0%
and then um contract with districts um
 
08:02:15.150 --> 08:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
for these um uh Niche type of uh
 
08:02:17.150 --> 08:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
situations um that
 
08:02:20.868 --> 08:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh come up and they will be in um
 
08:02:24.230 --> 08:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles um smaller Vehicles eight
 
08:02:24.240 --> 08:02:26.990 align:start position:0%
vehicles um smaller Vehicles eight
passenger

08:02:26.990 --> 08:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
passenger
 
08:02:30.190 --> 08:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
um and as I said this this one company
 
08:02:31.388 --> 08:02:31.398 align:start position:0%
in particular that we've been working
 
08:02:36.190 --> 08:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
with most recently is in 28 States doing
 
08:02:39.510 --> 08:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
this further discussion yes representa
 
08:02:43.628 --> 08:02:43.638 align:start position:0%
Tanner so are um you know I the the two
 
08:02:45.510 --> 08:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
big things for school transportation or
 
08:02:47.788 --> 08:02:47.798 align:start position:0%
student transportation is the inspection
 
08:02:50.430 --> 08:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
of the buses and the certificate of the
 
08:02:53.430 --> 08:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
drivers um and I think school bus
 
08:02:56.830 --> 08:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
drivers have to have a CDL license um in
 
08:03:00.468 --> 08:03:00.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and also
 
08:03:04.910 --> 08:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't say that these uh buses or
 
08:03:07.388 --> 08:03:07.398 align:start position:0%
uh Vans I guess they are buses owned by
 
08:03:09.990 --> 08:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
religious organizations or a
 
08:03:12.628 --> 08:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
nonprofit uh used exclusively as a bus
 
08:03:12.638 --> 08:03:13.468 align:start position:0%
nonprofit uh used exclusively as a bus
for

08:03:13.468 --> 08:03:13.478 align:start position:0%
for
 
08:03:17.150 --> 08:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
transportation um is it is
 
08:03:20.030 --> 08:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
the ones that I see where now schools
 
08:03:20.040 --> 08:03:21.510 align:start position:0%
the ones that I see where now schools
contract

08:03:21.510 --> 08:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
contract
 
08:03:24.910 --> 08:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
with somebody that uh has their own
 
08:03:26.788 --> 08:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
personal car but has the insurance
 
08:03:28.350 --> 08:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
carrier and everything else that they
 
08:03:30.590 --> 08:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
need to qualify have a little sign on
 
08:03:33.548 --> 08:03:33.558 align:start position:0%
them school bus or School vehicle or
 
08:03:36.270 --> 08:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
whatever um and I don't see anything in
 
08:03:38.948 --> 08:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
in this that would designate those those
 
08:03:42.468 --> 08:03:42.478 align:start position:0%
particular Vans as providers of school
 
08:03:44.948 --> 08:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
transportation um I don't see the CDL
 
08:03:47.388 --> 08:03:47.398 align:start position:0%
license I don't see
 
08:03:51.468 --> 08:03:51.478 align:start position:0%
um all all that was reviewed with uh U
 
08:03:54.388 --> 08:03:54.398 align:start position:0%
the department of safety DMV um and the
 
08:03:56.388 --> 08:03:56.398 align:start position:0%
gentlemen who were here earlier all that
 
08:03:58.150 --> 08:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
was reviewed and we went through in
 
08:04:01.308 --> 08:04:01.318 align:start position:0%
detail through all the administrative um
 
08:04:04.590 --> 08:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
rules as well um and made sure that for
 
08:04:06.628 --> 08:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
instance this one company who's most
 
08:04:09.270 --> 08:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
interested right now um would have no
 
08:04:12.868 --> 08:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
problem following all all of these um
 
08:04:15.270 --> 08:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
statutory references as well as all the
 
08:04:19.670 --> 08:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:22.150 --> 08:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay which and I think CDL license is
 
08:04:25.190 --> 08:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
only required for certain size Vehicles
 
08:04:27.388 --> 08:04:27.398 align:start position:0%
well there's this I know that there used
 
08:04:30.230 --> 08:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be a special license for van drivers
 
08:04:33.708 --> 08:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
that were driving school school you know
 
08:04:35.750 --> 08:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
um School operated because I drove some
 
08:04:38.308 --> 08:04:38.318 align:start position:0%
for the for coaching but we had to get a
 
08:04:42.548 --> 08:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
special license for that right um and um
 
08:04:44.670 --> 08:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a CDL but it was a special
 
08:04:47.070 --> 08:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
special license and and a
 
08:04:49.830 --> 08:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
physical exam um you know there's
 
08:04:52.030 --> 08:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of it that's defined to
 
08:04:54.430 --> 08:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's safe and we went
 
08:04:56.750 --> 08:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
detailed through every administrative
 
08:04:59.510 --> 08:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
rule um applying to school
 
08:05:02.030 --> 08:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
transportation um with this Trooper who
 
08:05:04.430 --> 08:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
um basically runs the program monitors
 
08:05:07.110 --> 08:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
the program and um went through it line
 
08:05:10.388 --> 08:05:10.398 align:start position:0%
by line so that we knew um is there a
 
08:05:13.190 --> 08:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
waiver available from this because of um
 
08:05:18.270 --> 08:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
the situation um and um will the company
 
08:05:21.708 --> 08:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
comply with uh you know X Rule and so
 
08:05:24.468 --> 08:05:24.478 align:start position:0%
every every rule was covered um and
 
08:05:29.468 --> 08:05:29.478 align:start position:0%
reviewed um and uh um the uh company
 
08:05:33.510 --> 08:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
involved right now was um uh agreeable
 
08:05:36.788 --> 08:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
to U every one of the applicable rules
 
08:05:39.990 --> 08:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
as well as these provisions of
 
08:05:43.030 --> 08:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
laws but they were against it at
 
08:05:46.670 --> 08:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
first weren't they when we first had was
 
08:05:48.830 --> 08:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
in a different section of law and the
 
08:05:51.230 --> 08:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
department of safety was not crazy about
 
08:05:53.350 --> 08:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
the section of law that's why this
 
08:05:56.110 --> 08:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
amendment has moved it to a different
 
08:05:59.948 --> 08:05:59.958 align:start position:0%
section of law um under the traditional
 
08:06:01.750 --> 08:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
more under Traditional School
 
08:06:04.468 --> 08:06:04.478 align:start position:0%
transportation whereas the other was um
 
08:06:06.628 --> 08:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
the original bill was in a section for
 
08:06:09.468 --> 08:06:09.478 align:start position:0%
Network Transportation which is uh
 
08:06:11.830 --> 08:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
different thank
 
08:06:16.430 --> 08:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
you further discussion represent B Bon
 
08:06:20.270 --> 08:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I guess thank you Mr chair um I think
 
08:06:22.868 --> 08:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot that's in here that's
 
08:06:25.030 --> 08:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
being presented at the last minute and I
 
08:06:27.830 --> 08:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't see any supporting documentation
 
08:06:31.788 --> 08:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
or anybody here to ask um because I know
 
08:06:34.708 --> 08:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
when we looked at the first one uh this
 
08:06:37.548 --> 08:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
the state police I believe were against
 
08:06:40.990 --> 08:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
it so I I find it just difficult to be
 
08:06:43.788 --> 08:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
asked to vote on something that I I just
 
08:06:47.590 --> 08:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
saw you know um an hour ago so
 
08:06:49.388 --> 08:06:49.398 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we thought we would be
 
08:06:52.350 --> 08:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
getting to this earlier and the uh the
 
08:06:55.948 --> 08:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
director of DMV was here along with two
 
08:06:57.468 --> 08:06:57.478 align:start position:0%
of the Troopers who were involved in the
 
08:07:00.468 --> 08:07:00.478 align:start position:0%
meetings um but they had to had to leave
 
08:07:06.070 --> 08:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:09.948 --> 08:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
time further discussion represent luno
 
08:07:12.388 --> 08:07:12.398 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much Mr chair and and
 
08:07:13.910 --> 08:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know my apologies to the members of
 
08:07:15.788 --> 08:07:15.798 align:start position:0%
the committee I certainly challenged
 
08:07:18.548 --> 08:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
whether or not the um the the amendment
 
08:07:22.070 --> 08:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
was was Germaine and um I'm I'm
 
08:07:23.868 --> 08:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
surprised by the response but I
 
08:07:26.948 --> 08:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
certainly accept the response uh and the
 
08:07:28.708 --> 08:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
reason I'm surprised by it though is
 
08:07:30.430 --> 08:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
because the sections are all different
 
08:07:32.030 --> 08:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
than what was proposed and the language
 
08:07:34.270 --> 08:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
is all different than what was proposed
 
08:07:35.868 --> 08:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
and I have the same concern that
 
08:07:38.788 --> 08:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
representative balbon just um just
 
08:07:42.788 --> 08:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
articulated that that that we we we
 
08:07:46.388 --> 08:07:46.398 align:start position:0%
haven't really uh fact we haven't held
 
08:07:48.830 --> 08:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the new language we
 
08:07:50.830 --> 08:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
haven't had the opportunity to find out
 
08:07:53.150 --> 08:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
what the experience has been in the 28
 
08:07:56.948 --> 08:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
states that do use is it is it ever
 
08:07:58.670 --> 08:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
right what's the name of it everen ever
 
08:08:03.388 --> 08:08:03.398 align:start position:0%
driven um and and I I have I have
 
08:08:05.590 --> 08:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
nothing to suggest anything about you
 
08:08:07.510 --> 08:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
know ever driven as a company or what
 
08:08:09.190 --> 08:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
their safety record and stuff but I
 
08:08:11.590 --> 08:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
don't know and and I haven't had a
 
08:08:13.868 --> 08:08:13.878 align:start position:0%
chance to um none of us have had a
 
08:08:18.670 --> 08:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
chance to um to ask ask and um and and
 
08:08:21.788 --> 08:08:21.798 align:start position:0%
then you know going going past ever
 
08:08:24.788 --> 08:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
driven to all right what are some of the
 
08:08:28.708 --> 08:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
other um situations that could uh could
 
08:08:31.590 --> 08:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
be developed could uh could you know a
 
08:08:33.868 --> 08:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
person say hey I'm going to use my
 
08:08:36.270 --> 08:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
personal vehicle I'm going to set up a
 
08:08:39.030 --> 08:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh a oneperson company and I'm going to
 
08:08:42.468 --> 08:08:42.478 align:start position:0%
drive students from point A to point B
 
08:08:45.468 --> 08:08:45.478 align:start position:0%
and uh following all of the the um
 
08:08:47.388 --> 08:08:47.398 align:start position:0%
requirement that are that are listed
 
08:08:49.110 --> 08:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
here potentially a lot less than what
 
08:08:52.110 --> 08:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
ever driven subjects their their drivers
 
08:08:54.548 --> 08:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
to we just don't know because we haven't
 
08:08:56.868 --> 08:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
had a chance to hold a hearing on it and
 
08:08:59.070 --> 08:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
I guess finally I'd say I think there's
 
08:09:01.948 --> 08:09:01.958 align:start position:0%
enough difference here that that I would
 
08:09:04.590 --> 08:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
suspect had this been maybe it has been
 
08:09:06.308 --> 08:09:06.318 align:start position:0%
filed as a bill for
 
08:09:09.190 --> 08:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
2024 that that why wasn't this filed as
 
08:09:11.708 --> 08:09:11.718 align:start position:0%
a new piece of legislation so that we
 
08:09:14.910 --> 08:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
could could actually hold a hearing on
 
08:09:14.920 --> 08:09:17.548 align:start position:0%
could could actually hold a hearing on
it

08:09:17.548 --> 08:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:09:21.030 --> 08:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:24.788 --> 08:09:24.798 align:start position:0%
discussion yes rep Mr chair that's fine
 
08:09:29.030 --> 08:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
I just um has an RFP gone out for this
 
08:09:32.030 --> 08:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
service um usually when the state does
 
08:09:34.590 --> 08:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
something there's a series of interviews
 
08:09:36.708 --> 08:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
and a variety of people who looked at
 
08:09:40.190 --> 08:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
you go through a whole process has that
 
08:09:42.110 --> 08:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
happened the state would not be
 
08:09:44.548 --> 08:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
contracting with them this would be on a
 
08:09:52.070 --> 08:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:54.110 --> 08:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's no particular company or
 
08:09:57.788 --> 08:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
anything named in here and it's it's the
 
08:10:00.230 --> 08:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
same thing only put in the right
 
08:10:03.230 --> 08:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
places and it's just or provider of
 
08:10:05.788 --> 08:10:05.798 align:start position:0%
school transportation vehicle services
 
08:10:08.350 --> 08:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
and I went over and talked to the
 
08:10:10.910 --> 08:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman who came in to find out why
 
08:10:13.388 --> 08:10:13.398 align:start position:0%
they were here because I thought maybe
 
08:10:17.350 --> 08:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
they were here for um
 
08:10:20.430 --> 08:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
background checks and they said no they
 
08:10:22.430 --> 08:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
were here in case we had any questions
 
08:10:25.110 --> 08:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
for this they said as far as they were
 
08:10:26.910 --> 08:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
concerned it was very straightforward
 
08:10:28.670 --> 08:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the same thing whether it's
 
08:10:31.350 --> 08:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
a school bus or some other provider they
 
08:10:32.788 --> 08:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
have to jump through all the same oops
 
08:10:35.548 --> 08:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
they have to do the same thing and so
 
08:10:37.990 --> 08:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
they they didn't they thought it would
 
08:10:39.430 --> 08:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
just go through they didn't see a
 
08:10:43.030 --> 08:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
problem with it um because we're just
 
08:10:47.468 --> 08:10:47.478 align:start position:0%
requiring all the same things just
 
08:10:49.548 --> 08:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
or School
 
08:10:52.110 --> 08:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
transportation or you know or provider
 
08:10:53.788 --> 08:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
of school transportation vehicle
 
08:10:57.270 --> 08:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
services but so I don't understand what
 
08:10:59.708 --> 08:10:59.718 align:start position:0%
the big deal is
 
08:11:02.628 --> 08:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
but further discuss represent Celli yeah
 
08:11:04.308 --> 08:11:04.318 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out one other
 
08:11:07.948 --> 08:11:07.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:12.230 --> 08:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
um several companies I I've talked to um
 
08:11:14.468 --> 08:11:14.478 align:start position:0%
they both and in this case I'm just
 
08:11:16.388 --> 08:11:16.398 align:start position:0%
looking at it now ever driven they
 
08:11:19.308 --> 08:11:19.318 align:start position:0%
provide the parent with an app so they
 
08:11:21.788 --> 08:11:21.798 align:start position:0%
can track in real time where their
 
08:11:26.308 --> 08:11:26.318 align:start position:0%
student is which is um pretty nice uh
 
08:11:28.910 --> 08:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
feature um get real time
 
08:11:28.920 --> 08:11:31.230 align:start position:0%
feature um get real time
information

08:11:31.230 --> 08:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
08:11:34.030 --> 08:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
08:11:36.548 --> 08:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
um it's unfortunate that they had to
 
08:11:41.350 --> 08:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
leave um I'm sorry and the uh um the
 
08:11:43.110 --> 08:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
trooper involved in school
 
08:11:45.510 --> 08:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
transportation had hoped to be here but
