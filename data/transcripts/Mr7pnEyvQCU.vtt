the ones that were listed on the agenda
 
00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
I did ask
 
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
um a representative of the Saint
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
with a a grant proposal for that
 
00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
Railroad and is it is
 
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
cap22-19 informational
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
and if you would

looking around and several of the people

sitting around this table will be back
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
next year so I think that it was
 
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
important to understand what is going on
 
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
and what the impact might be on money
 
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 align:start position:0%

and safety improvements program better
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
known as Chrissy
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
um we're applying St Lawrence Atlantic
 
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
has got the States of Maine
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Vermont making an
 
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 align:start position:0%
application to finish up the remainder
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the improvements needed to bring this
 
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
rail up to uh the guy call it
 
00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
um 286 pound that really means what you
 
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
can carry on the rail right now we're
 
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
only allowed to carry 263 pounds uh it's
 
00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 align:start position:0%
a full car and it's really the modern
 
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
businesses when they're locating in a
 
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
state I want to see what you have for
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
rail service and we don't have adequate
 
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
rail in the North Country and
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
this rail was first started
 
00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
before the Saint Lawrence Atlantic
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
Seaway was ever built the only way you
 
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
get material from a product from Canada
 
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the world was to come
 
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
down to these this they call it the
 
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
Saint Lawrence Atlantic railroad it
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
comes down to down to its Portland and
 
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
you get to warm water go up to Nova
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
Scotia and come down to uh even to
 
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.450 align:start position:0%
Scotia and come down to uh even to
Portsmouth

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
this is the rail has been you know the
 
00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 align:start position:0%
last time it was improved back in the
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
40s so we needed to get improvements
 
00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it over the years and
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have seven miles
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
left to get uh to bring it up to 286
 
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
pound Vermont has
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
a portion and Maine has the portion to
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
get it up to 286 and when having modern
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh real and the reason it's important is
 
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.270 align:start position:0%
uh real and the reason it's important is
when

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
the be
 
00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.870 align:start position:0%
the be
business

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
I know they got their business and
 
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
economic affairs
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
people go out and try to recruit
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
companies to the North Country the first
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
thing to look is what do you have for
 
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.570 align:start position:0%
thing to look is what do you have for
transportation

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
and they look at the railences you've
 
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
got an Antiquated real we can't get a
 
00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 align:start position:0%
full car into into our companies up here
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
so we've been and I've been working
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
around since 2010 and we've got it down
 
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we need about
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
seven uh
 
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars approximately the
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
Vermont needs 3.6 and may need 7.6 so we
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
it was the first time we're going to get
 
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
three states making an app a joint
 
00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
application and as I said the Chrissy
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
Grant people they thought this is an
 
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
excellent project
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh and so we're going to see what we can
 
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
get for money
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
but I provided was you know again I want
 
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
to show you the map that's how that's
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
what the St Lawrence Atlantic railroad
 
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 align:start position:0%
comes down from Canada or into Vermont
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
and into
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Maine uh right now
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're good up until
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
we can get to Stratford in New Hampshire
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
we're up to Stratford New Hampshire uh
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
or they call it a maple Town New
 
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.689 align:start position:0%
or they call it a maple Town New
Hampshire

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
is the uh that's the area we're up to
 
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
good Rail and then we need another seven
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
miles to go to the Vermont border
 
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.330 align:start position:0%
miles to go to the Vermont border
and

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
the next map
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
is just showing where the product is
 
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
coming to that area we've been keeping
 
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
track of what's trying to get up into
 
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:08.660 align:start position:0%
that into the North country
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
and item number three is the Tri-State
 
00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
Regional Real upgrade project good
 
00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:17.419 align:start position:0%
explanation of the rail
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
and again the number five is
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
um sort of a history of
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
public private partnership that was
 
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
started in the public works committee
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
and and what's happened it didn't go to
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
transportation in the Senate was always
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
going to the public works it to the
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
capital budget committee
 
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
because it was a we were looking for
 
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
funds and we'd usually go into the
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
when it came out of Public Works
 
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.020 align:start position:0%
so that's why
 
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
it didn't go to the transportation
 
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.250 align:start position:0%
it didn't go to the transportation
committee

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a quick my quick
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
overview thank you and I would like to
 
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:56.060 align:start position:0%
emphasize that we're talking about
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
Freight rail on this Excuse me yes this
 
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
is doll Freight rail
 
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
um so that we don't get tangled into the
 
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
whole debate on passenger rail on this
 
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.710 align:start position:0%
whole debate on passenger rail on this
um

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that with this
 
00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:13.370 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that with this
um

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
requests for the grant that there is a
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
requirement that we have it's a matching
 
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
money and that is the intention of
 
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
um St Lawrence and Atlantic to use money
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
that this body is already granted to you
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
for improvements of that rail line to do
 
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
the portion of that match that's quick
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
last capital budget we had five hundred
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
thousand from the state and 500 000 from
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
the St Lawrence Atlantic that will be
 
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
used as the matching Monies to get the
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's why I wanted those
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
who are coming back to uh understand
 
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
what's going on with that
 
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.350 align:start position:0%
what's going on with that
um

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.750 align:start position:0%
so
I

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
 
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.170 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
committee

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
Paul thanks for being here and the
 
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
information you provided uh can you just
 
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:17.180 align:start position:0%
I missed the first what was the weight
 
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:19.700 align:start position:0%
you're moving up to
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
286. what was the weight previously that
 
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
equation

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
equation
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
two six no two two eighty threes we were
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
going up to 263.
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
three percent thank you
 
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
um seeing none and there was no
 
00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:50.389 align:start position:0%
um seeing none and there was no
um

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
other business to come before us
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
um which was kind of surprising since
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's the last meeting before February or
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
March but it is what it is
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
um we cannot set a new meeting for this
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh statutory committee since it will be
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
up to the speaker and the Senate
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
President to appoint new members after
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
um it will not be the highest priority
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
that either of them have since they have
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
to set the Committees in the house in
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
the Senate to deal with parking all
 
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:29.579 align:start position:0%
those little things uh before they worry
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
about statutory committees so I I would
 
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
wager even though it's illegal in this
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
state that it would probably be February
 
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
or March before this committee would be
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
called back into session by whomever is
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
um on that committee with that I want to
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
thank all of the members of the
 
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
committee especially those two who drove
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
down from the North Country for no
 
00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:57.069 align:start position:0%
down from the North Country for no
business

00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
but thank you for coming down today and
 
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
but for all of the work that's been done
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
over the last two years on
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
um trying to keep the state on an even
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
Keel as far as the capital budget and
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with our facilities I
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for all of your work on that
 
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for all of your work on that
and

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:22.100 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%

two years uh and I know from it's a can
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
be a difficult job and I know that being
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
a previous chair it can be difficult but
 
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
