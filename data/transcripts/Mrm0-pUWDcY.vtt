homes in new hampshire veterans home and
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
make an appropriation therefore
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
so those are on my quick search all the
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
bills that we have that are currently
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
going to be heard
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
um the goal of this committee is not
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily evaluating those bills
 
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.069 align:start position:0%
necessarily evaluating those bills
however

00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for is the
 
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.270 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for is the
intersection

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
of shall and shall nots in either state
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
law or agency rules that as it relates
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
to medical intervention immunizations
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
so as a former police officer i know
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
there are certain roles of government
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
that are that are appropriate so i i and
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
medical intervention is appropriate so
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
as a former police officer i use the
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
idea of an iea
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
right so there are times when a person
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
suicidal and this police mandate that
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
they get they commit them to get
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
treatment to to make sure they don't
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
hurt themselves so uh we use the uh fire
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
department with narcan in an overdose
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
situation we can use um an inmate in the
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the prison who gets stabbed and is
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
refusing medical attention brexit
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement medical care we're gonna
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
stitch that person that inmate up so we
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
know that there are certain roles in uh
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
of government that are appropriate and
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
where medical intervention is
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate and given certain
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances the problem is i'm not
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
omnipotent and the committee's not
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
omnipotent we don't know where all of
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
those intersections are and the goal for
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
this meeting is to bring out some of
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
that information so the committee can
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
can evaluate uh those intersections and
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
in state law or agency rules um to see
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
if they're appropriative see if there's
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
they need strengthening or maybe they
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
need to be weakened or maybe nothing
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be done with them so that's the
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
kind of thing i think the committee is
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
looking for and i'll open up the
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
committee members if they want to make
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
any other comment before we start taking
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
erica you're good uh erica leon is here
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
she's replacing uh herschel nunes uh who
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't it was unable to attend
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
great all right first up erica who we
 
00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.150 align:start position:0%
great all right first up erica who we
got

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
first up we have ann edwards from the
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
i'm ann edwards from the attorney
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.109 align:start position:0%
general's office
i'm

00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
really here more to answer questions and
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
you might want me to answer questions
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
after some of the agencies speak
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
since they're the ones who know their
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
own statutes better
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
in looking at the invitation that was
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
provided to the group
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
there were some specific questions
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
i can't answer all the questions of
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
where the shells and the shall nots are
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to talk them through
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
clearly as you just said representative
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
lang if there are shells in the law we
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
have to follow them for the most part
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in those same statutes there
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
are some exceptions or there is case law
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
that has developed exceptions to those
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
shalls and if there are shall nots we
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
have to follow those as well
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
and it's the same
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
provisions that are available sometimes
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
to modify what that shall not means in
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to the question of the
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
definition of medical intervention
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
interestingly that phrase itself shows
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
up once in new hampshire law
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it shows up in
 
00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.550 align:start position:0%
and it shows up in
the

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
statute rsa 415 dash capital d colon 3
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
which is the definition section of the
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that rsa sure it's rsa
 
00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:53.349 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that rsa sure it's rsa
415

00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
415
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
dash roman capital d
 
00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:57.829 align:start position:0%

00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
poland
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the specific
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
provision is
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
roman five
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a very long paragraph
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
that defines long-term care insurance
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
and in that
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
statute it provides that with regard to
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
life insurance this term does not
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
include life insurance policies that
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
accelerate the death benefit
 
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.790 align:start position:0%
accelerate the death benefit
especially

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
for specifically sorry for one or more
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
of the qualifying events of terminal
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
illness medical conditions requiring
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinary medical intervention or
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
permanent institutional confinement and
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
that provide the option of a lump sum
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
payment for those benefits
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
so that's the only place in new
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire law where the phrase exists
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
as a result if
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
the this committee would like to suggest
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
a definition of the term medical
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
intervention i think
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
the path is wide open for you to do that
 
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.390 align:start position:0%
the path is wide open for you to do that
when

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
so in
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
the law when we are looking for how to
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
define a term or how to define
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
a phrase
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the courts are looking at that we
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
all go to the dictionary and so one of
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
the places to regularly start with that
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
is the merriam-webster dictionary which
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
is where
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
i proceeded and that they do not have
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
the specific phrase
 
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.750 align:start position:0%
the specific phrase
medical

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
intervention as a definition there
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
they do have the phrase the the word
 
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.150 align:start position:0%
they do have the phrase the the word
intervention

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
and that word is defined as the act or
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
fact of taking action about something in
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
order to have an effect on its outcome
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
and they further on in the online
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
version go into an explanation of
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
medical intervention as
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
the act or fact or a means of
 
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.390 align:start position:0%
the act or fact or a means of
interfering

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
interfering
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
with the outcome or course especially of
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
a condition or process
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
as to prevent harm or improve
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
functioning and so then they start
 
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
talking about using specific examples
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
such as
 
00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.030 align:start position:0%
such as
mitral

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
mitral
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
valve replacement
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
in order to deal with a condition so
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's and then when you look at other
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
definitions i went to places like the
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
national institutes of health under the
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
national cancer institute under that
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
definition in medicine
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
intervention intervention is a treatment
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
procedure or other action taken to
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
prevent or treat disease or to improve
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
health in other ways
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then there are many more medical
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
dictionaries out there one of the
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
broadest definitions that i found
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
was that intervention in medicine means
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
anything meant to change the course of
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
events for a person surgery
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
a drug a test a treatment counseling and
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
providing informational pamphlets
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
so that's about the broadest definition
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
that i could find and so i think what
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
that shows you is
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
how you define the term medical
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
intervention in new hampshire law will
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
be what it applies to
 
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
be what it applies to
the

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
one challenge with defining that term
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
too broadly is to make sure that
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
you're not sort of catching provisions
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
of the law that you don't mean to
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
interfere with
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
by preventing in a certain way and so
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at house bill 220
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
on lines
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
starting on line 10 which is the shall
 
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
not provision of house bill 220 and all
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
the things that house bill 220 doesn't
 
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.550 align:start position:0%
the things that house bill 220 doesn't
implement

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
many of these are those provisions that
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
suggest that you be cautious of
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
and aware of in in defining medical
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
intervention the first is the
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner of health human services
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
ability to order quarantines and to
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
order treatment for communicable
 
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.990 align:start position:0%
order treatment for communicable
diseases

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
the second is the requirements under
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
current new hampshire law for
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination prior to admission to school
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
or child care agencies
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
the third is the involuntary emergency
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
admission process
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
and the involuntary treatment of
 
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.549 align:start position:0%
and the involuntary treatment of
patients

00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
the fourth is
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
to not limit treatment authorized by
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
guardians or surrogates or individuals
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
who hold a durable power of attorney
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
the fifth is that it doesn't apply to
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
nursing homes the state hospital or any
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
other medical facility operated by the
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
state or by one of the political
 
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.390 align:start position:0%
state or by one of the political
subdivisions

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
and then in the next roman numeral
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
section it also excludes the department
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
of corrections for any
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
medical treatment or immunization that's
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
required there so those are some of the
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
specific areas
 
00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.069 align:start position:0%
specific areas
the

00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
depending on how broadly you define the
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
term you could find that you also
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
come into situations where there are
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
mandatory examinations before an
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
individual can hold a job
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
so for example airline pilots have to
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
have an examination commercial truck
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
drivers also have to have
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
examinations police officers have to
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
have health examinations and have to do
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
physical fitness tests so there are
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
those types of provisions that you want
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
aware of as to whether or not you want
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
to include those in in such a definition
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
the other question had to do with
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
informed consent
 
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.950 align:start position:0%
informed consent
and

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
in that area i ended up in the american
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
medical association's ethics
 
00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.589 align:start position:0%
medical association's ethics
treatises

00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
treatises
 
00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:48.630 align:start position:0%
treatises
and

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
read a fair amount about informed
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
consent in new hampshire law also has
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
requirements regarding informed consent
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
and informed consent is the process
 
00:48:57.599 --> 00:48:58.390 align:start position:0%
and informed consent is the process
where

00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
communication between a patient and a
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
doctor result in the patient
 
00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.109 align:start position:0%
doctor result in the patient
understanding

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
a treatment understanding the possible
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
positive and negative outcomes
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
in in conjunction with the
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
this condition that the patient has
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
they understand what the specific
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
medical intervention is and what will
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
occur during that procedure that is
 
00:49:25.839 --> 00:49:31.030 align:start position:0%
occur during that procedure that is
necessary

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
they understand
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
any of the options for payment
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
and for
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
after care requirements
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
and that this informed consent
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
conversation occurs so that the doctor
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
is comfortable that the patient
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
understands all of these provisions and
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
the patient is then able to make an
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
informed decision
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
based on the information the patient has
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
received and all of that needs to be
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
documented in
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
the patient's medical records
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
the one exception to all of this is that
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
in the case of an emergency if the
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
patient isn't available and no other
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
individual who has the ability to make
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
decisions for the patient is available
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
then the physicians can initiate
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
treatment without informed consent and
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
essentially informed consent needs to be
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
given after the fact by a full
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
explanation of what the treatment was
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
and why the decision was made
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
as it was and what other opportunities
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
i believe those respond to the specific
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
questions that came out in the
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
invitation so i'm more than happy to
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
answer any of the questions that i can
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
and as i said i'll remain during the
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
hearing so in case there's something
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
that comes up that you'd like to ask me
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
afterwards thank you thank you very much
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
is there any questions from the
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee representative leon um thank
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
you mr chair uh thank you for being here
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not good at these
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
microphones thank you for being here and
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
answering these questions uh when you're
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
speaking to the emergency and when a
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
patient can't consent um we actually
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
work through the advanced directive
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
change in the law last year
 
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.190 align:start position:0%
change in the law last year
um

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
is are the doctors able to override a
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
patient if they are saying that they do
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
not want the treatment
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
and where is that line
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
so that's a really difficult question to
 
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.270 align:start position:0%
so that's a really difficult question to
answer

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
it it really is fact based on what the
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
situation is
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
and if the patient says no and the
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
patient is mentally able to make that
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
decision then the doctors don't override
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
those decisions because a patient can
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
choose to not accept treatment if a
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
patient wants to do so the the challenge
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
becomes whether or not the patient's
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
cognitive functions are impaired during
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
that time period either because they're
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
ill or because they're injured or for
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
some other reason such as a substance
 
00:51:56.559 --> 00:51:57.349 align:start position:0%
some other reason such as a substance
use

00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
challenge and in that in those cases
 
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.349 align:start position:0%
challenge and in that in those cases
then

00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
they're depending on what the documents
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
are there's usually a secondary person
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
who can make decisions for a patient who
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
is not able to make decisions on their
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
own and that person will be contacted
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.829 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
goalie

00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
what happens if
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
a law is put in place
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
that conflicts with federal law
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question if it's a
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
duly enacted federal law and it applies
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
to all of the states then the state of
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
is most likely required to follow that
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
law unless there's a challenge to that
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
law and so as a result part of what
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're seeing right now with respect to
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
different rules such as the osha rule
 
00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.150 align:start position:0%
different rules such as the osha rule
requiring

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.230 align:start position:0%
requiring
individuals

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
requiring employers of more than a
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
hundred employees to have vaccinations
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
or have a testing protocol the state
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys general in different states
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
are challenging that law and they're in
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
that rule and the reason for that is
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
because when those rules go into place
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
as long as they're duly enacted
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
correctly they are valid laws whether or
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
content of the law is constitutional or
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
not is a different question as to
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a duly enacted law
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
and if it's a duly enacted law then
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're required to follow that federal
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
we have a follow-up to that jeff for a
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
second i just want to make sure we're
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
talking about basically the supremacy
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
clause right in the constitution that
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
says that federal law
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
trumps state law yes and and i think the
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
to one of representative goli's points
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
is we're dealing with not necessarily a
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
federal law that was gone through the
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
legislative process but we're dealing
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
with an executive order out of a single
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
branch of government as compared to a
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
state law that's gone through the
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislative process and two branches of
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
government in theory
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
and does the supremacy clause apply to
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
executive orders so that's an excellent
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
question what i was speaking about
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
specifically was the rule which is
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
different than the executive order that
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
is going through the process
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
under the federal government's system
 
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.470 align:start position:0%
under the federal government's system
for

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
enacting rules with respect to the
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
executive order it's the same type of
 
00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:24.470 align:start position:0%
executive order it's the same type of
position

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
if the executive order is duly enacted
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
then we as a state and it applies to us
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
if we as a state are required to follow
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
it unless we challenge it that is the
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
point of our third branch of government
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why we raise those challenges
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
so again i think we've seen the attorney
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:54:48.079 --> 00:54:49.349 align:start position:0%
general's office
has

00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
signed on but i'm not i can't remember
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
whether that relative to the executive
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
order or to the osha rule and
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
challenging the osh rule i don't recall
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
so we have currently a letter
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
outstanding that we issued with respect
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
to the osha rule with i think 24 other
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
attorneys general raising concerns about
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
that that rule has not come out of
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
the committee yet it hasn't been
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
put in in place so as a result
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a court action against
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
it the court action that we joined last
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
week is with respect to the executive
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
order and the requirement that federal
 
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.710 align:start position:0%
order and the requirement that federal
contractors

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:30.549 align:start position:0%
have to
require

00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
their employees and additional employees
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
who have contact with them it's quite a
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
broad group of people that are falling
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
under that
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
provision in the executive order so we
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
are challenging that
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
and we are challenged in one of the
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
reasons we are challenging that at this
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
point is it is now in
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
it is now
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
being implicated against state agencies
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
business in economic affairs has
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
received a notice vital statistics has
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
received a notice regarding it and so we
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
now have a basis for being able to
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
one follow-up question so
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
if the legislature enacted a law does
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
that make the
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
ag's office case stronger weaker if we
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
enacted a law that had to deal with
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
mandates and federal mandates that have
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
to be duly acted laws versus rules or
 
00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.710 align:start position:0%
to be duly acted laws versus rules or
regulations

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.510 align:start position:0%
regulations
um

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
or i should say rules or exempt or
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
executive orders does that help the
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
so these lawsuits are are going to be in
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
federal court and the federal court
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
looks at state law and certainly would
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
look at a duly enacted state law as the
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
intent of the state of new hampshire but
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
that state law wouldn't necessarily
 
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.789 align:start position:0%
that state law wouldn't necessarily
override

00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
override
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
a federal
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
executive order or a even
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
specifically a federal law that would be
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
something that the court would take into
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
consideration as an interest that the
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
state is showing as an official position
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean that it would
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
overrule it even with the executive
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
order if the executive order was duly
 
00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.390 align:start position:0%
order if the executive order was duly
enacted

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
i have one more if nobody else says
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
anything so i'm going to go back to the
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
informed consent conversation is the
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
assumption in an informed consent
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
conversation that the
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
the consent is given freely and
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
voluntarily without coercion or threat
 
00:57:28.079 --> 00:57:29.430 align:start position:0%
voluntarily without coercion or threat
yes

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and i have
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
one other question from the legislation
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
from senate bill 74 last year
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
there is language there that says that
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
recognizing this right which is the
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
right to make your health care decisions
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
and to refuse health care treatments the
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
refusal of health care treatments is not
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient to demonstrate that a person
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
lacks capacity to make health care
 
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.349 align:start position:0%
lacks capacity to make health care
decisions

00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
yes no concerns there no no concerns at
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
all i mean that is the state of new
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire state law and i would argue
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's the state of federal law people
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
can choose not to accept treatment okay
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
and um that same bill also said that if
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
somebody if somebody's refusal then
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
leads to a declaration of incompetence
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
um that it protects the fact that
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
they've refused this in the start of the
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
cascade in order to to have a higher
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
burden um actually if there's any other
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
questions let me get that exact language
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
i'll ask one more while she's looking up
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
her language so i'm gonna go
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
back to hp 220 and then in all of open
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
fairness we've had conversations around
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
hp 220 before yeah as i was the prime
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor of that bill
 
00:58:45.119 --> 00:58:46.309 align:start position:0%
sponsor of that bill
um

00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
relative to hb 220 is it your
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that law that only
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
applies to the covid
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine or does it apply to all
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and immunizations so it's
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's interpretation of
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
that law that it only applies to covet
 
00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.349 align:start position:0%
that law that it only applies to covet
vaccines

00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
i think that answered my question enough
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
we'll sit in thank you for the comments

good morning i'm beth daly the bureau
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
chief for infectious disease control at
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of health
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'm joined today hi good morning melissa
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
st there i'm the chief legal officer for
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.950 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
and i understand that there were some
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
questions for for dhhs to answer related
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
to the definition of medical
 
00:59:46.799 --> 00:59:47.910 align:start position:0%
to the definition of medical
intervention

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
currently the department does not have a
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
definition for medical intervention that
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
that term does not exist in our say 141c
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
which is our communicable disease
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
statute and so we don't have that term
 
01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:01.829 align:start position:0%
statute and so we don't have that term
in

01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
our statute nor in our rules
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
um certainly there are interventions i
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
guess you could say that um that are
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
that the department conducts uh things
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
under 141c including
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
isolation and quarantine orders
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
required treatment for those who are at
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
risk to spread a communicable disease
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
and other things that i'm sure beth
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
could speak to a little bit more
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
certainly we're here to answer any
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
questions and are happy to um providing
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
information that the committee would
 
01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:32.549 align:start position:0%
information that the committee would
like

01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
great yeah and i'll just add a little
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
bit more detail about 141c and what the
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
department where we have shells so there
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
is a requirement for
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
certain vaccinations for a child in
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
child care and school entry um those are
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
under 141 c
 
01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.870 align:start position:0%
under 141 c
20

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.750 align:start position:0%
20
a

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
there are two permitted
 
01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:55.349 align:start position:0%
there are two permitted
exemptions

01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
whereby parents can not have their child
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and they can still choose to
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
go to school or still attend school or
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
child care and those are for
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
medical reasons if someone can't
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
medically be vaccinated or for religious
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
beliefs and then there's a notarized
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
notarized form that they can fill out
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
um for that purpose and present to the
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
school so that this the child can be
 
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.230 align:start position:0%
school so that this the child can be
allowed

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.030 align:start position:0%
allowed
um

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of those are that's really the
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
only shell i think for medical
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
intervention in this section
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
um on that applies routinely we do have
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
the authority to issue
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
orders for treatment which is quite
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
uncommon for us to do
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
the disease that we do the most
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh have done that most frequently for is
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis so in our state
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
if someone is diagnosed with
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis which can be a deadly
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
condition and globally is a leading
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
cause of death
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
we do compel them to receive antibiotic
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
treatment so that they're not out in the
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
community potentially infecting other
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
individuals obviously the vast majority
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
of people want to take this treatment um
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
freely and usually when issued presented
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
with an order
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
they do comply with the the treatment
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
and we've not had someone um there is a
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
due process outlined for them in the
 
01:02:11.359 --> 01:02:12.549 align:start position:0%
due process outlined for them in the
statute

01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
and we've not had people
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh take that course of action to to
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
object to the order and it's usually
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
just a matter of them understanding the
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
importance of the treatment
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
so that's it i think in terms of shells
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
i did just to piggyback onto what ann
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
edwards said had said about
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for medical intervention
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
for employment
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
there i just wanted to mention it's not
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
pertain it's not from dhhs or it's not a
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
state requirement but there are some
 
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.990 align:start position:0%
state requirement but there are some
um

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
jobs that require vaccinations as well
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
and one particular one i just wanted to
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
highlight for you was rabies vaccine so
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
if you work in a veterinary office or if
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
you work in a laboratory that processes
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
rabies specimens because it's a 100
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
percent uh fatal disease there's only
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
one person that we know of that survived
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
that disease they do require rabies
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine as well so again that's another
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
thing you might want to consider as you
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
look at the scope of your
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
questions for dhhs
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair and thank you both
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
for being here today uh when you speak
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
to the orders that can be issued by dhhs
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
do those need to be individual orders or
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
could those be blanket orders
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
no there are individual orders
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
pertaining to a specific individual
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
we've issued them for isolation and
 
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.069 align:start position:0%
we've issued them for isolation and
quarantine

01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
quarantine
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
and then the treatment ones that i
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned as well and they pertain to a
 
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.150 align:start position:0%
mentioned as well and they pertain to a
specific

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.510 align:start position:0%
specific
individual

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we have a reason for a justification
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
for that order do you want to try yeah
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
no that's that's exactly right and so
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
when an individual is issued an order um
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
they obviously you know have the
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comply with the order or
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
there's also the due process um that
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
beth mentioned earlier that they can
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
appeal that um and go in and so it has
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
to apply to the individual so that they
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
have their they can go through that due
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
process um
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
rights type of um hearing if they if
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
they so choose
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
can you speak into the microphone i'm
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
just going to comment online that they
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
can't hear you when you're speaking
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um i guess the other question
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
is you say that the rabies vaccine is
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
mandated for employment because of the
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
100 fatality rate it's my understanding
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
that while flu vaccines are required for
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
some employment there are there are
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
accommodations for those
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct right
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of other vaccines
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
that might be required for certain types
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
of employment they might require
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
hepatitis b vaccine influenza those are
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
some of the most common ones if you work
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
in health care or in a laboratory
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
it really depends there's no state law
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
that is required one time
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
well i think i'll take that question
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
just in terms of explaining the
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
requirements for schools so there are a
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
number of uh
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
vaccines that require multiple doses in
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
a series
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
many times the children get all of the
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
doses they need for example you
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned hepatitis b which is a three
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
dose series
 
01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
dose series
and

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
the diphtheria tetanus and acellular
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
pertussis vaccine has four or five doses
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
so they actually are getting multiple
 
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.190 align:start position:0%
so they actually are getting multiple
doses

01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
doses
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
most of those vaccines though are not
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
annual vaccines which i think is what
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
your point is what about flu we don't
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
require flu for a child care and school
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
entry um norocovid yet
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
um most of the times where you're
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
proving that you've met the vaccine
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
requirements is at the kindergarten
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
entry and then again there are some
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines that you do need again
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
such as the tdap vaccine tetanus
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
diphtheria and acellular pertussis
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
because whooping cough
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
has been shown that your immunity wanes
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
over time and so you do need additional
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
doses of that throughout your lifetime
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
potentially just to get your tetanus
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
vaccine every 10 years right so you do
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
need additional vaccines in order to
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
attend seventh grade is usually where
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's about happening again and then
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
the schools keep track of the kids
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
vaccination status and if they're
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
missing any for example at that seventh
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
grade entry point they're probably
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
providing it or as they go to middle
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
school providing that so i think your
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
your point is correct that for school
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
and child care entry currently
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
um the burden of
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to enter is only happening
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
once or two times throughout the child's
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
course of school attendance because
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're not requiring
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
annual vaccines there's not an annual
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement at this point
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
does that answer that help or answer
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
so i have a couple for you um so you
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
talked about um tb right so that was on
 
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
how many times has the commissioner used
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
its authority to
 
01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:54.470 align:start position:0%
its authority to
require

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
a citizen against their wills i guess is
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
the real question if someone volunteers
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
for it it's not an issue even if it is a
 
01:07:00.079 --> 01:07:01.109 align:start position:0%
for it it's not an issue even if it is a
shell

01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
shell
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
but when someone chose not to volunteer
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
to have their the proper treatment for
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
tb that the commissioner forced that how
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
many has that ever occurred and if so
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
how many times
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
um we have ordered
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
isolation and treatment for people with
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis it's very rare but i
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
actually have to go back and look um how
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
often this happens
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think we've written an order one time
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
this year for tuberculosis
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
maybe a few you know once a year or so
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
that happens out of the 20 or so
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis cases that we get each year
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes what happens is the
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
individual doesn't understand the
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
importance of the um
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
treatment and when you know we're trying
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
to explain to them why it's so important
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
for them to treat it and then when you
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
present them within order they're like
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
oh you you know you were serious that
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
this is really important and i will do
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
it again no one has come no one has
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
entered through that due process of
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
actually ultimately refusing to be
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
treated for example
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um relative to the uh you
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned rabies in certain
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances for a process so i guess i
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
guess my question is again going about
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
mandates and conversations under
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
i recall under federal law there was
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
there was originally uh
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
a thing about business mandates or
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
mandates in general especially in the
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
healthcare field
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
having to be correlated as a direct
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
threat to the job function
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
and then the language they use is a
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
direct threat um does that apply to any
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
of the mandates that we're currently
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
looking at or is it just a broad mandate
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
that has no correlation to job function
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
but only correlation to whether or not
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
we want to get the vaccine or not do you
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
want to speak to this i don't know if
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
you looked into the direct threat
 
01:08:40.239 --> 01:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
you looked into the direct threat
language

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
language
yeah

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
um i don't know that i'm that familiar i
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
know that has been incorporated in and
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
was in part of the discussions last year
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
around it um i think part of that direct
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
threat language has to do with um
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
for example in a healthcare setting
 
01:08:57.679 --> 01:08:58.630 align:start position:0%
for example in a healthcare setting
there's

01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
potential harm that would come to the
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
patients that they're serving which is
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
the justification for
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
um requiring vaccination those settings
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't think i can speak more to
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
um and going back you had said there
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
were limited places in the
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
law or rules that you apply a shell but
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
one of the ones you didn't talk about is
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the whole reason i filed hp 220 which
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
was the vaccine requirements around
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
foster families and rather than create
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
an exemption kind of situation where if
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
you had a child who was i mean who
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
compromised you would require that child
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
to go to a vaccinated family you created
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
the broad
 
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.910 align:start position:0%
the broad
rule

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
that says if you want to be a foster
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
parent the entire family including all
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
the children in that family must be
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinated isn't that true
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
um that is not under my purview that was
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
under another agency within dhhs do you
 
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:53.250 align:start position:0%
want to can you speak to that
 
01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:54.310 align:start position:0%
want to can you speak to that
[Music]

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so uh our uh
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
dcyf program is responsible for the
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
for the administration of that rule and
 
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.669 align:start position:0%
for the administration of that rule and
so

01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're not here unfortunately today to
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
speak to that specific foster parent
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
rule uh from what i understand
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
they felt it was important to
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that foster parents and the
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
children within those households that
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
are caring for for foster children
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
receive the covet vaccine
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
and in that it is within their ability
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
to to do so i'm sorry they were not
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
required to get the code vaccine they're
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
required to get influenza and other
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines but not the coveted vaccine
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
sorry i misspoke there so uh i i i can
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
certainly get more information and more
 
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.510 align:start position:0%
certainly get more information and more
more

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
i can ask for dcyf to
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
give you more information on the
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for foster parents if
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's what you would like
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with it i just want to make
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
sure we understand that there is at
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
least one other place and i don't know
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
because you know where else it might be
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
but i know at least one other place
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
where it's a shall
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's in your rules and it just it's one
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
of the things this committee needs you
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
know is the whole reason i filed 220 was
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
i sat on jail car when that rule came
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
through and opposed it then on religious
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
grounds because there were no exemptions
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
really allowed within the rule um but
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's just a broad-based shell for every
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
foster family must get vaccinated and
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't know where else and i was
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
hoping you were coming with answers
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
where in your rules and laws you had
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
shells like that that i know about but i
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
obviously don't know all of your rules
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
and i was hoping you were coming
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer it that you've read
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
the materials as part of the
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
registration process so that's how most
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
organizations are doing that that's how
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
our state-run vaccination clinics
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
operated as well and you know many of
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies and healthcare
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that have registration
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
portals for vaccination appointments
 
01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:45.189 align:start position:0%
portals for vaccination appointments
we'll

01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
ask you to look at these documents as
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
part of the registration before you go
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
ahead and schedule
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
great there's a follow-up question that
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
because of your answer so
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
relative to that
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
one we just heard from the attorney
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
general's office that consent needs to
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
be giving freely and without threat how
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
do you get around the the people who are
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
being don't want to take the vaccine but
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
or have their livelihoods being
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
threatened and being forced to take in
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
the vaccine they have to make the
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
decision between do i keep a house over
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
my head and food on my table where do i
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
get the shot how is how do you define
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
that how do you make sure that the
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
person's giving a free and informed
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
consent that's that's voluntary and not
 
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.709 align:start position:0%
consent that's that's voluntary and not
coerced

01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
so i think that's part of the issues
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
that you all are addressing here i don't
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
have an answer to that question for you
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is around the
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
ethics of it so again my question is
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
around is is that if is it ethically
 
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.630 align:start position:0%
around is is that if is it ethically
correct

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
or or a doctor to give a shot that's
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
being coerced by an employer
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
under the threat of
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
keeping a house over my head and food on
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
my table for my children is is that
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
ethically correct
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
is that something we should be looking
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
into is that something that
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know just as a straight ethics issue
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
we that should be addressed in the in
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't have an answer for you to
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
that question i mean there's
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
laws and rules and regulations that come
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
forward that require
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
certain things to happen and that you
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
have to interpret those within the
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
context of other
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
laws and rules and regulations that
 
01:13:20.239 --> 01:13:21.669 align:start position:0%
laws and rules and regulations that
exist

01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm not the one administering the
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine right
 
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.070 align:start position:0%
vaccine right
[Music]

01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry doesn't a vaccine program fall
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
within your agency that the state's
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
running um sorry i am not administering
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
the vaccine so the you know i personally
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
am not a vaccine administer i'm not a
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
health care provider i'm an
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist and public health
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
official and we make our role at the
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
health department is to make the
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines available to the public
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
who want to get vaccinated why someone
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
is choosing to get vaccinated is up to
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
that individual right whatever
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
constraints they have upon them as a
 
01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
constraints they have upon them as a
person

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
informs their decision making but i'm
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
not engaged in that process of it
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
i just make the vaccine available to
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and i and i will say that
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
medical providers
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
are overseen by the office of
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
professional licensure the board of
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
medicine the board of nursing those who
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
are responsible for the administration
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
of the vaccination
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
they have their own
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations that they must
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
follow that's not under the purview of
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
services that's under the
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure but
 
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.550 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure but
certainly

01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
we would expect
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
it and
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
hope that all individuals are ethically
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
receiving a vaccination
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
but it would be if there are complaints
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
or anything like that related to that
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
type of coercion you're speaking of that
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
would go to the office of professional
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
licensure for their for their review
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
i guess the reason i was asking because
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
you were saying you were running
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
licensing clinics dhhs is running
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
licensing clinics i'm assuming you're
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for everything that occurs
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
within that clinic if you're running it
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so i'm i'm just concerned that our
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
as a state we're not taking on a
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
liability because we're not asking the
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
right questions about whether it's
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
freely given consent or is it is it
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
forced or coerced consent by an employer
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
to keep your job
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so at the vaccination
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
clinics um the individuals no one is
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
being forced to take a vaccine every
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
everyone who comes to those has
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
presented saying that they want to
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
receive the vaccine and they're there
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
freely on their own you know own accord
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're not requiring anyone to get
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated holding people down to
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinate them
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's they're there they presented to get
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccine because
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
they have made the choice to get
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think what my point is about whether
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
that consent is freely given or whether
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's coerced or threatened and whether
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
or not a doctor has an ethical ethical
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
obligation to understand whether that's
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
a force or free consent or is it because
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
you're being threatened with your
 
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.310 align:start position:0%
you're being threatened with your
livelihood

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
livelihood
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
right roberto goldie
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and this
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
i guess would be addressed to your
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
concern to you as we are already doing a
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
number of these with flu vaccines with
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
businesses requiring other vaccinations
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
or other
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
immunizations for employment
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
is that where we're going with this or
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
is it just specifically with the kovajic
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
well again i think right now we're
 
01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.229 align:start position:0%
well again i think right now we're
speaking

01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about vaccinations in
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
general and we're just seeing it we're
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
in unprecedented times i think where
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
we're seeing mandates that are causing
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
mass exodus to our workforce right we
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
had uh i think i read something like 26
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
fire departments were shut down in new
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
york city because the firemen who
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
refused to get
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and that now creates a
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
different public safety issue um that's
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
going on so i guess the concern is
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
generally around um we've never seen
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
these kind of mandates before right in
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
an unprecedented fashion where people
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
are being threatened with their jobs
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
and you know other other reasons why
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
if someone goes into the nursing
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
industry prior to this they knew they
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
had choices to make um and we know that
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a federal decision about that
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
mandates and direct threats and nurses
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
could choose to take
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
what doctors could choose to go into
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
parts of medicare medical um
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
treatment that
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have compromise compromised
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
people so they don't have to worry about
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get the vaccine i'm not
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to be around immune compromised
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
people like cancer wards right so i'll
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
go work in podiatry instead right where
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not where it's not such a big issue
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
right so they had those choices now
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
they're not even being given those
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
choices and i think the question is
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
around that is that people are being
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
their livelihoods are being threatened
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
and does that impact informed consent
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
right and the ability to give free
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
and voluntarily voluntary informed
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
consent or not is with their livelihoods
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
being threatened like that now because
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
now you can't even go be a podiatrist
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
without having the vaccine so now you're
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
getting no choice
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
so i think that's part of where we're
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
having this conversation is where where
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
does that go how does that work um how
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
does that intervention work uh that
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
medical intervention and immunization
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
work in our society uh and is is
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
informed consent now thrown out the
 
01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.630 align:start position:0%
informed consent now thrown out the
window

01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
window
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
and if i just may respond briefly that
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
and that's that's where i'm going is
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's already requirements for other
 
01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.229 align:start position:0%
there's already requirements for other
vaccines

01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
for these medical fields
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
in place and that's all i wanted to make
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
was that comment thank you
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you you've spoken to the side the
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
consent part of informed consent the
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
discussion of
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
people having to click through and say
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
that they've read the information packet
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they don't ask a
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
question when the person administering
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
the vaccine says do you have any
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions it that doesn't seem
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
like that's informed to me when we're on
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
our computers we click through and say
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
yes we accept the terms i'd like to
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
understand how the department views
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
an informed patient and what kind of
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
information should be available and
 
01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.470 align:start position:0%
information should be available and
ethically

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
ethically
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
should make sure that people are truly
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
so the process that we are using is
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
pretty standard process of providing the
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
information to the individual who is
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
saying that they have read it and agreed
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
to it so i think the responsibility is
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
on them
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
for people who don't have internet
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
access or whatnot they have those
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
documents are provided to them
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
in fact they're often provided anyhow
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
routinely to people when they're at
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
getting their vaccination they have that
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
information presented to them in there
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
so if they have any questions about it
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
there's ample opportunity to
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
to ask questions if you have any
 
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
concerns about getting the vaccine
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the people who are signing up
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinated are people who have
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
already you know made the choice that
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have questions or concerns
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
they've had those answered and they want
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinated
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to wrap my head around
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
how these novel vaccines are treated
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
differently than other
 
01:19:44.239 --> 01:19:45.270 align:start position:0%
differently than other
novel

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
novel
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
treatments other biologics other
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
procedures and why there's more
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
information and more discussion of that
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
information needed for other
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
interventions because we're looking not
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
just at vaccines we're looking at
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
medical interventions more broadly
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
why is there a different standard of
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
consent of
 
01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.030 align:start position:0%
consent of
information

01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
um i personally am not sure where there
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
is a different standard in that
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
as i said the process that we use is
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
like processes used for other
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinations when you sign up to get
 
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.110 align:start position:0%
vaccinations when you sign up to get
vaccinated

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's it's all based on this a similar
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
process that happens for influenza
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine or other vaccines that you get
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's a standard process okay so your
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge is simply limited to those
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and not to broader medical
 
01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.270 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and not to broader medical
practice

01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
for me personally i can't speak to
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
broader medical practice i'm not a
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
actually and do you have any insight to
 
01:20:36.159 --> 01:20:37.030 align:start position:0%
actually and do you have any insight to
that

01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say that for
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
typically for novel uh vaccinations
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
those that you're under eua the federal
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
government requires additional
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
information to be provided to
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who are receiving a
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination that may not have received
 
01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.350 align:start position:0%
vaccination that may not have received
full

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
under the fda so so there are there may
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
be additional information that's
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
required but the process wouldn't
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily change it would just ensure
 
01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.790 align:start position:0%
necessarily change it would just ensure
that

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
that whatever additional information is
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
necessary and the eua very very well
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
could require additional process and in
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
that situation they'd be
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know medical practitioners would be
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
required to follow that
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just trying to understand how
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
somebody with terminal cancer can be
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
denied a therapy because they didn't go
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
through all the process for information
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
yet we don't have that standard here so
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's something that's probably better
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
to ask of somebody else i'm just trying
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
to understand this thank you
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%

new hampshire department of education
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
so i think i
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
i um
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
mostly i'm here to take questions but i
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
can speak briefly to the questions that
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
the committee posed
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of shallow shall not for
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
medical interventions such as masks and
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines i'm not aware of any shell or
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
shell knots as to masks or vaccines
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
vaccines of course are addressed broadly

masks

01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
masks
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's the department's interpretation
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.070 align:start position:0%
that the
uh

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
state board in delegating authority to
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
local school boards to
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh have health and safety policies have
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
effectively delegated the mask uh issue
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
to to local to localities and there's no
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
reference in the statutes that i'm aware
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
of to masks but um there are a few areas
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
where there are and again uh to echo
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
what um others have said already there's
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
no definition of um medical intervention
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
in any of the um
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
rsas relating to the department of
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
education that i'm aware of there are a
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
few instances where there's shells and
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
shell shells and maize
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
or what might be thought of as medical
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
those out
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%

responsive but i'm happy to take any
 
01:25:27.679 --> 01:25:29.830 align:start position:0%

questions

01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%

01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for

getting prepared with the with the
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%

01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
question for
 
01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.229 align:start position:0%
question for
chris

01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
chris
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
i guess i just want to be clear so the
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
department of education's policy
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
regarding masking
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
is that it's up to local school boards
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
to make a determination based on their
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
public health policies
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct so um
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
let me see i just think i might be able
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
to find a reference in our
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that will be
 
01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.470 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that will be
helpful

01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
under rsa 21n the state board of
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%

01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%

01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
that the decision on whether to have a

01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%

01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases and school
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
attendance there's no rules
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
or laws that you're familiar with other
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
than that that chapter of law relative
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
to vaccination requirements for school
 
01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.709 align:start position:0%
to vaccination requirements for school
attendance

01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct my understanding is that
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
the vaccination requirements are
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
addressed in 141 c20a with the um the
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
policies that are that are part of that
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
statute but i don't know of any other
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
area where that's addressed thank you
 
01:27:43.679 --> 01:27:44.790 align:start position:0%
area where that's addressed thank you
representative

01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you this might be
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
a bit too much of a clarifying question
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for a local school
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
board to require vaccinations beyond the
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
public health requirements
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
no the department has taken the position
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
that that rsa 141c leaves that authority
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
in the legislature except to the extent
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
that it's been delegated to the
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner of health and human
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
services where there is a provision to
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
add and the department has taken the
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
step of issuing a technical advisory to
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
schools i believe it was dated june 7th
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
where we specifically told schools
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
schools may not add to the
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
list of required vaccinations because
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
that process for deciding what is a
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
required vaccination is governed by 141c
 
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.390 align:start position:0%
required vaccination is governed by 141c
exclusively

01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
exclusively
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
so and the department takes the position
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
that that applies to non-public schools
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
as well as public schools because
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
non-public schools
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
that are approved by the department of
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
education for
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance law purposes have
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
to comply with uh the ed 400 rules which
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
incorporate 141c
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.229 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome

i think she's looking something up um
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll ask a generic question here
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
and that's relative to
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
um we've seen
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
at the um
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
lately what's going on with school
 
01:29:09.679 --> 01:29:10.550 align:start position:0%
lately what's going on with school
boards

01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
right and and and and various activities
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
around that are there any laws or
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
anything that you can think of that the
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
legislature should look at that deal
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
with some of these things like masking
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
um that that's being
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
um rallied about at school boards is
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
there any place that we should be
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
considering a law to ease these kind of
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
tensions so they don't occur
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
do you have any kind of input in that
 
01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.830 align:start position:0%
do you have any kind of input in that
area

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
um i mean that is a broad question and
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it it touches on
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
policy i know the commissioner
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
thinks it's important that parent input
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
be part of decisions on masking
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
so i mean i think it's the department's
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that those decisions are
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
based on the current structure placed
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
with the localities um so
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of resolving the tensions i
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
suppose it resolves the tension in one
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
way if the legislature were to decide
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
well we're going to make a masking
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
policy protocol or put or put guardrails
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
on those i suppose that limits the
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
tension and to the extent that that
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
takes that
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
policy decision out of the hands of
 
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
local officials where a lot of those
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
clashes are happening but i don't know
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
if that might just move the tension to a
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
different level um but that that again
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's not i don't know that that's a
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
question that i'm
 
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.790 align:start position:0%
question that i'm
um

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
qualified to weigh in on i would just
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
say that the commissioner feels very
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
strongly that uh parents should have a a
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
role in a say in whether there's masking
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
policies that apply to their children
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
and how those are applied
 
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you i will ask one more i
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
apologize i used to be a device and
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
diagnostic analyst
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
this is my wheelhouse um does the
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
department have any policies on the
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
diagnostics and how
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
students test to return or is that all
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
simply left to the department of public
 
01:31:01.199 --> 01:31:02.870 align:start position:0%
simply left to the department of public
health

01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
um we have not gotten
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
very involved in in that we have
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
generally stayed away from testing as
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
deferring to public health um with the
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
exception of we have been very clear to
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
schools that any testing that
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
is done should have
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
parental consent for it
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've also been very clear to schools
 
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.669 align:start position:0%
we've also been very clear to schools
that

01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
obligations to comply with ferpa which
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
is a federal student privacy law
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
any medical information they collect
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
from students is a educational record
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
under that statute and they need to be
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
very careful that they're maintaining
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
those records
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate level of privacy
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
but other than that other than the
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
privacy issue and parental consent we
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
have not had any uh input that i'm aware
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
of into the how the testing regimes are
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
working out thank you
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%

01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
but at the municipal level
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
the only
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
examples that i can think of
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
that i think
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
that i would
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh identify as medical interventions
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
would be in some kind of emergency
 
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.310 align:start position:0%
would be in some kind of emergency
context

01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of people have mentioned um
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
involuntary admissions
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
which would be
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
which the police department might be
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh chairman lang rep
 
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.070 align:start position:0%
uh chairman lang rep
mentioned

01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.350 align:start position:0%
mentioned
narcan

01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
narcan
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
administered in a in an overdose
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
situation and that that would be
 
01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.669 align:start position:0%
situation and that that would be
typically

01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
emts or perhaps the police department
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
but again emergency responders
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i can imagine
 
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.470 align:start position:0%
and i can imagine
there

01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
probably are
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
other emergency situations where
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh someone might be administering
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
um some kind of sedative or pain
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
reliever for you know extreme
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
if an accident victim is in
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
is in extreme pain
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
but those are
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
those are the things i can think of and
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
i don't really know much about those i
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
know that representatives of the police
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
chiefs association and the fire chiefs
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
association have been invited so they
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
probably can
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
speak better than i can
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
the the only other thing
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
that i can think of that
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
might be considered
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
medical intervention would be drug
 
01:34:35.199 --> 01:34:36.870 align:start position:0%
medical intervention would be drug
testing

01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
private employers
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not an expert on this but i
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
believe that private employers
 
01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:49.350 align:start position:0%
believe that private employers
are

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
more or less unrestricted in their
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
ability to require drug testing for
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
governmental entities are subject to a
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
lot more restriction because
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
if you're actually testing someone for
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
drugs and if that's being done by a
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
local government or a state government
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
that i think is considered to be a
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
search or seizure
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
and it's subject to the
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable search or seizure provision
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
of the fourth amendment
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
i believe municipalities cannot
 
01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:30.070 align:start position:0%
i believe municipalities cannot
routinely

01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
test uh
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
require their employees to undergo a
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
drug test
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
there is an exception for
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
cdl drivers and and i think maybe a few
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
other limited exceptions and as i
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
understand it the courts have indicated
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
that because of you know there's a
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
there's a balancing test and if you're
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
testing someone who's driving a a
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
highway truck for the town
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
um the safety importance outweighs the
 
01:35:59.199 --> 01:36:00.390 align:start position:0%
um the safety importance outweighs the
um

01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:01.109 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
outweighs the unreasonable search or
 
01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.550 align:start position:0%
outweighs the unreasonable search or
seizure

01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
seizure
 
01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
seizure
concern

01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
um but that's the that's the only other
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
instance that i can think of and as i
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
say other than that
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about emergency
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
situations involving emergency
 
01:36:15.119 --> 01:36:16.870 align:start position:0%
situations involving emergency
responders

01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
responders
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities as employers
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
um you know there's
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know obviously uh
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
employers requiring
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh their employees to be vaccinated
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
right now is a big issue
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i think um
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
i would view municipal employers
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the same
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
light as
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
private employers
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
as far as i know there are no municipal
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
employers that have
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
that have required
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh vaccines for any of their employees
 
01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:56.210 align:start position:0%
uh vaccines for any of their employees
um

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.669 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
and i don't know and i wouldn't
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily know if there were but as
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
far as i know they're not requiring that
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
and that's as i say that's about all i
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
have to say i'd be happy to try to
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'll ask a couple
 
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:16.870 align:start position:0%
i'll ask a couple
um

01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
so this is also about what we could
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
possibly do where there's where this
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
causing tension between municipalities
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
and the state and how to manage that a
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
little bit better relative to these
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
mandates that are going around is there
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere you can speak of for your
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
members that you think there should be
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
some clarification or some cleanup
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
in any statute that is relative to this
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
medical intervention or immunizations
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think so i mean as i said it
 
01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.229 align:start position:0%
i don't think so i mean as i said it
it's

01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh municipalities i mean whether it's
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
covert or something else as far as i
 
01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.669 align:start position:0%
covert or something else as far as i
know

01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh municipalities have not uh
 
01:37:59.679 --> 01:38:00.870 align:start position:0%
uh municipalities have not uh
traditionally

01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
traditionally
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
required immunizations or
 
01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.669 align:start position:0%
required immunizations or
or

01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
um i i and i think on the assumption
 
01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.669 align:start position:0%
um i i and i think on the assumption
that

01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know immunizations generally
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
for the worst uh diseases generally
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
occur when you're
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
four or five six years old
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.870 align:start position:0%
um and so
uh

01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
when you're at the level of a
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
municipality hiring someone as an
 
01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:31.510 align:start position:0%
municipality hiring someone as an
employee

01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
it really it really is not an issue and
 
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.270 align:start position:0%
it really it really is not an issue and
certainly

01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
going beyond the employee context and
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
and uh trying to require anyone else to
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
be immunized i think would be uh
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
pretty far out of bounds
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
our our members are not asking for any
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation or clarification as
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
far as i know
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and regarding the drug testing
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
you were talking about in certain
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances that's usually relative to
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
the federal federal motor carrier law uh
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
requirements so trucks over a certain
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
size that kind of thing and that's why
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
they're required because they have to
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
have a cdl license as compared to just a
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
regular driver's license that's my
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you i just would like to ask a
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
clarifying question it sounds that
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
you would not support any municipality
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
that tried to put on their own vaccine
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
requirement or other requirements beyond
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
we would not uh sorry i didn't quite
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
we did see with masks which are a
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
removable intervention so that's that we
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
saw that some towns that put those into
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
place um you don't see any expectation
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
that any towns or cities would try and
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
create their own vaccine requirement for
 
01:39:47.679 --> 01:39:48.870 align:start position:0%
create their own vaccine requirement for
citizens

01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
or anybody else in that in their within
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
the bounds
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know i i hate to i hate to say i i
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
can't imagine something because i can
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
imagine almost anything uh but i
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
as if you're talking about
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
as a municipality requiring citizens to
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated
 
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
almost can't imagine that i i really
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
don't think you know imposing you know
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
the city of concord imposing a
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
requirement that everyone in concord be
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
immunized um
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
no i i don't
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you we're just trying to beat
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
around these edges and make sure that we
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
have clean edges thank you very much so
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
again i think i'm trying i don't
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
remember the rsa but there's an rsa
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
relative to they have a general welfare
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
clause to what cities can pass and do
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
and i and we had a bill last year to
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
deal with that to try to clean that up
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
just i think on this for this reason so
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
i guess the question is
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
is it possible under that rsa which i
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
can't remember the number of it but i'm
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
sure you know it
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
that uses that general welfare clause of
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
the citizens would it be possible for
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
them under current state law to create a
 
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.030 align:start position:0%
them under current state law to create a
broad

01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
broad
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
community vaccine requirement
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
given hp 220 as well um
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
just to be clear if
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
for a town that would be rsa 147 one
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
or a city it would be rsa 4717
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
so would it be possible under
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
those statutes for a city or town to
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
institute a an immunization requirement
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:44.709 align:start position:0%
maybe
um

01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
the the language is pretty broad
 
01:41:48.159 --> 01:41:49.189 align:start position:0%
the the language is pretty broad
um

01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:49.199 --> 01:41:50.229 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:50.239 --> 01:41:51.990 align:start position:0%
so
it's

01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:52.950 align:start position:0%
it's
it

01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say
 
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.629 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say
um

01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah all i can say is maybe it depends
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
on how you interpret it again
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
whether any
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
the idea that any municipality would
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
actually try to do that
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
um i think that's
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's very hard to imagine
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
so so the specific sentence just so
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
everyone's clear is under one uh for
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
cities anyways 47 17
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
and it's section 15 and there's a
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
sentence in there it says they may make
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
any other bylaws or regulations which
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
they seem
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
to be for the well-being of the city and
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
i guess that's my concern is that
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
sentences that sentence give broad
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
latitude um or would that be a conflict
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
do you think with hp 220 that says
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.639 --> 01:42:46.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.239 --> 01:42:47.350 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
hb 220 as i read it doesn't doesn't say
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
you can't mandate immunizations it says
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
you can't require them as a condition to
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
receiving a public benefit or whatever
 
01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.550 align:start position:0%
receiving a public benefit or whatever
um

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:01.750 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:07.189 align:start position:0%
but
uh

01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
as i said
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know someone the language is pretty
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
vague so someone could read that and say
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that allows us to do whatever we
 
01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
yeah that allows us to do whatever we
want

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
um and therefore we're going to mandate
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
immunizations for everybody
 
01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.870 align:start position:0%
immunizations for everybody
um

01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
i don't i really don't think anyone's
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
gonna do that
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
and and i don't think that legislative i
 
01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
and and i don't think that legislative i
suppose

01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.030 align:start position:0%
suppose
if

01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
if a city or town tried to do that that
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
might be the time when you would say we
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
need legislation to clarify that you
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
can't do that
 
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.430 align:start position:0%
can't do that
um

01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
and i mean if and i haven't looked at
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
all these bills
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
they're not all available yet but maybe
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's one in there that says that no
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
municipality can require
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
that its citizens be
 
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.709 align:start position:0%
that its citizens be
immunized

01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
immunized
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that certainly would would because
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's more specific that would
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
preempt any
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh effort to try to do that either under
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
forty seven seventeen or under one forty
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
okay anything else for goodell
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
cordell thank you very much for coming
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%

called on me because my testimony is uh
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
essentially similar similar to what
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%

um the the pertinent statute rsa 141 uh
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%

01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
questions that were um uh uh asked uh to
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
ask to prepare for our testimony about

01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
nhsba
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
has advised our members since the
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic to follow the advice
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
and recommendations both from governor
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
sununu and commissioner edward blue that
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
mask requirements or mass mandates would
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
be a local decision one of the bedrock
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
principles nhsba advocates for is local
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
decision making of local educational
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
matters so we did not tell our members
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
to implement mass mandates we did not
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
tell our members not to implement mass
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
mandates we said listen to your parents
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
listen to the health experts and make a
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
decision on what's best for your local
 
01:46:08.719 --> 01:46:10.790 align:start position:0%
decision on what's best for your local
community

01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of medical
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
intervention i think that's been i think
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's been covered significantly from
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
some of the other people that have
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
testified i don't have a definition of
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
that um what i can tell you though is
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
that through the series of statutes in
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
the rsa 200 series
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
as well as department of education rule
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
i believe it's 311 and 312 which talk
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
about some school health services
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
the only time there isn't any
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily per se informed consent
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
would be in a first aid situation with a
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
student you know kid falls off the the
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
jungle gym or trips and falls and they
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
have to you know bandage up his knee or
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
but all the other aspects
 
01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:51.510 align:start position:0%
but all the other aspects
about

01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
nebulizers and uh insulin and things of
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
that nature they are or medication
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
during the school day they all require
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
some level of parental consent a note
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
from the doctor uh parents signing off
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
on it parents requesting that the the
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
inhaler the the insulin be provided at
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
school or stored at school
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
um i know from the doctor saying how
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
often you know johnny or susie needs
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
this medicine or needs the insulin or
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
signs to look out for so
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
um within the school context um
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no there's no
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
uninformed consent short of an emergency
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
situation where a student um requires
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know essential first aid uh one
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
point that i do want to uh just clarify
 
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
i believe um representative lang you
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
asked about rules relative to
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
um immunizations are under rsa 141 c20c
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
there is a department of education rule
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's ed311 um and
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
all the only thing that this rule does
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
is basically restate the statute a
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
parent or legal guardian shall have a
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
child immunized against certain diseases
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
as determined in in rules hep i presume
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's health and human services um
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements adopted by
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner of department of health and
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
human services the child shall be exempt
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
from immunization in accordance with rsa
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
141 c20c that's the religious exemption
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
and the um uh if the if the vaccine
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
would cause a medical harm to the to the
 
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
would cause a medical harm to the to the
individual

01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
and you get a note from a doctor from
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
that a child is exempt from
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
immunizations a child who is exempt from
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
immunizations in accordance with
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph b shall not attend school
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
during an outbreak of a communicable
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
disease if a child is not immunized does
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
not have a religious or medical
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
exemption or is unable to provide
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
evidence of acceptable immunization for
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
condition of enrollment he or she shall
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
not be admitted to school
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
that restates what the statute basically
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
states anyway but i just wanted to bring
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
you uh to your attention that there is a
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
rule that speaks uh department of
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
education rule that does speak to the
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements the rule
 
01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
following that
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
311.02 medication during the school day
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
again very prescriptive requires
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
parental consent bringing a note from
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
the doctor things of that nature so um i
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
don't think i have anything new to add
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
um but i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
that the committee may have
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
okay anybody from the committee
 
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have one
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
of course um so i because you brought up
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
the the whole uh area around medical
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions for schools
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
um given that the uh attorney the the um
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
what is the surgeon general has has said
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
that they want to look at religious
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
exemptions again and whether or not
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're being abused
 
01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.510 align:start position:0%
they're being abused
um

01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
the question i have is is it is it a
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
proper role for schools to decide how
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
religious an individual person is
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're entitled to an
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
exemption is that something we should
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
tighten up or clean up or is that just
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
so broad that it leaves you exposed yeah
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative i did see you have a bill
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
and i saw some of the language um about
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
broadening i believe your bill says
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
religious exemption medical notary
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
conscience objector i believe that was
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
the phrase that's being used
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have a position we mean nhsba
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a position on vaccines just
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
in and of themselves especially as it
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
relates to kovid
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
you know we have not been asked whether
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
or not we can man we meaning school
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
districts can mandate employers or
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
students to be vaccined to either attend
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
school or to continue employment we just
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten that question
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
so i i don't want to give a firm answer
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
to your question just yet representative
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
i've seen the bill
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know if any sba will be
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
testifying on it when we get into the
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
legislative session but we will
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
certainly be tracking it um and i just i
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
would want to do more research on
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps what other states have um on
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
their laws relative to immunizations and
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
and opt-outs and parental consent and
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
things of that nature before i offer a
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
formal position on behalf of nhsba
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
right i i guess the question wasn't
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
about the bill it was just merely about
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that is is it better to clarify
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
things like medical exemptions and
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
so that the school is not exposed to you
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
know number one you're requiring a
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
parent to open up a medical chart to
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
prove medical exemption rights and now
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
you have to read the people's medical
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
charts and the second one being
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
religious exemption you know especially
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
with this surgeon general pointing at
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
abuse now you have to go back and see
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a valid religious
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
exemption whether it's a sincerely held
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
belief and is that a role that we really
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
want our schools to be in to do those
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
kind of things is read medical charts
 
01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
and and determine whether or not a
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
person is religious enough to be
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to a religious exemption sure
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative in terms of religious
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
exemption yeah i it's not a school
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
board's role to determine whether or not
 
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
you were being sincere in your religious
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
beliefs or your statement of you know
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
religious exemption relative to the
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
medical record aspect i i you know
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
school districts do not want to receive
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
medical information from students but
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes we have to
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's a medically
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
fragile student who's receiving some
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
sort of special education services uh
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
this legislature recently passed a very
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
significant law expanding um protections
 
01:52:09.119 --> 01:52:09.830 align:start position:0%
significant law expanding um protections
for

01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh students who have a concussion in
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
youth sports i forget that bill number
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
from last year and so there are certain
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which the school
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
district does need to get medical
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
information from a medical provider
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
concussions special education services
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
um 504 disability plans or if a student
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
needs to be out of school for a medical
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
condition or a disability of some sort
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
so you know i understand the question
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
but i guess the larger
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
the larger answer is that we already are
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
doing that for very specific needs so
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
that may fall under you know the need to
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
look at a medical record relative to an
 
01:52:45.119 --> 01:52:46.390 align:start position:0%
look at a medical record relative to an
immunization

01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
is there's at least
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
analogous responsibilities that school
 
01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
districts already have relative to an
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
individual's medical information
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:00.310 align:start position:0%
anybody else
okay

01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%

erica daniels turn on the pink cards
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh no there's
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%

01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
