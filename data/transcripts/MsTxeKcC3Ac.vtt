00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 150 is going to amend the we're
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
looking to amend the composition of the
 
00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 align:start position:0%
family mediator certification board and
 
00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
I do have the chair here with me to
 
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 align:start position:0%
speak to this as well as to propose
 
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
what what may be a technical correction
 
00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
so but before we get into that I just
 
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you all that back
 
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
in December honey Hastings and some of
 
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
you may remember honey Hastings who is
 
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
an attorney who spent years in this
 
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
building and over at the State House
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
advocating on behalf of the legal
 
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
community and family mediators she had
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
contacted me about doing this work
 
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 align:start position:0%
because the the this family mediator
 
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
certification board is on it has been
 
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
unable to meet in over a year because
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have a quorum and you can
 
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 align:start position:0%
actually look at the website and see
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
where it goes from the ability to meet
 
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
to you know meetings being canceled and
 
00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
very you know that's one of the things
 
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 align:start position:0%
that I looked at so we had this
 
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
conversation because honey and I have
 
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 align:start position:0%
worked together before and unfortunately
 
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
before I could even file the language
 
00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 align:start position:0%
she passed away suddenly
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
and so I met I dearly missed the
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with her again but
 
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
it it made sense to me more than uh more
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
you know more than and really now that
 
00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
this is the work of honey and we need to
 
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to see this through to the
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
end on her behalf so that's how this all
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
got started in 2022 as I spoke about
 
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
meetings being canceled out of 12
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
meetings 11 were canceled
 
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
by way of background Family Mediation is
 
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
a process in which a neutral third party
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
facilitates the resolution of family
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
disputes by assisting the parties and
 
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
creating their own voluntary agreements
 
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
it's designed to be less adversarial
 
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
than the traditional court process in
 
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
order to act as a family mediator in New
 
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you need to be certified
 
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
and certification represents the family
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
mediator certification board so they are
 
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
housed and work out of there this board
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
was established to develop and maintain
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
ethical professional and educational
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
standards for the certification of
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
family mediators to safeguard our the
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
states our state citizens the board is
 
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
also responsible for investigating
 
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
complaints and taking disciplinary
 
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
action as authorized so I'm going to run
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
through not run through that would be
 
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
actually running I'm going to speak to
 
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
the changes in each section section one
 
00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 align:start position:0%
of the bill reduces the number of public
 
00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 align:start position:0%
members from two to one the number of
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
family mediators on the board from five
 
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
to three it maintains a judge it
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
maintains one member of the New
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bar and it removes the marital
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
master and mental health professional
 
00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
section 2 prescribes the terms how
 
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
vacancies are filled and how persistent
 
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
absences will be addressed Section 3
 
00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
reduces the number of meetings from 12
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
to 6 per year
 
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
this bill also outlines the transition
 
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
that will need to take place to move
 
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
from move the Quorum from 11 to 6 as
 
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
well as phasing out of the marital
 
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
master and the mental health
 
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
professional I again I thank you for the
 
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
opportunity I would welcome questions
 
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
and if I can't answer them I'm so glad
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
to have Fran Lane with me who's the
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
chair of this board and one of the
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
things that Fran is going to speak to
 
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.990 align:start position:0%
things that Fran is going to speak to
that

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
I I think we're going to need to
 
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
consider here is in section three
 
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
and I'll pass this email on to chair
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
McGuire it it recites that a quorum
 
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 align:start position:0%
shall be half of the membership
 
00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and Council
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
but only fought but only five members
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
are so really what it does is it instead
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
of being based on six it's based on five
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
and cutting that in half is 2.5 and
 
00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0%
really doesn't work so we're gonna need
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
to I believe make a change there or
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully in committee you all can make
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
a change and between Fran and I we could
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
Supply that language okay
 
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.870 align:start position:0%
Supply that language okay
so

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the opportunity good
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
to see you again and um I'll take
 
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.529 align:start position:0%
to see you again and um I'll take
questions

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator are there any
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lucas
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you looking at three B hold on
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
three let me get you that's in the
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
Quorum part
 
00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.029 align:start position:0%
Quorum part
um

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly if um
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
you know seats are are vacant that will
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
reduce will not reduce the Quorum it
 
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
sounds like it would and my concern is
 
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
to get down to one person or something
 
00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
and they'd be the whole thing I mean so
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
I I have some concerns about
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know it automatically reducing the
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
Quorum if people you know if the seats
 
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
vacant I understand why with not being
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
able to meet there might be a desire for
 
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419 align:start position:0%
that but I I don't know if you can
 
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas thank you for the
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
question it's a a good observation I
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
can't comment on it
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
at the moment I'd like to bring this to
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
Fran Lane and see if we can provide more
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
clarity there I just haven't had enough
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
time to think about it all right thank
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
I have one Senator when I was looking at
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
the current statute it still has fee fee
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
setting Authority with the board and it
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
also so I'd like to remove that if
 
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
that's not a problem
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
since the fee setting Authority is being
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay and and also
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
there's a line that says that the board
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
can create requirements for licensure
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
that are not in statute and I would very
 
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
much like to remove that and simply add
 
00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:06.009 align:start position:0%
much like to remove that and simply add
any

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:06.019 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
requirements created by rule into the
 
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.430 align:start position:0%
requirements created by rule into the
statute

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
rather than statute creating it what
 
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
rules to create the requirements is that
 
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
right the requirement should be in the

currently constituted I just want to
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%

1980
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
um our board experienced a number of
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
different difficulties beginning with
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
the pandemic in terms of forum issues
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
and most severely in 2022 the past year
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
where we were only able to to hold one
 
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.490 align:start position:0%
where we were only able to to hold one
meeting

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
for for Quorum issues by Statute the
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
board was originally constituted with 11
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%

conflict resolution Association and also
 
00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:17.339 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire attorney
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
um this past year as I mentioned we were
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
unable to have a full Quorum of the
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
board in order to conduct our business
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
month to month and as I indicated and I
 
00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
month to month and as I indicated and I
think

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
um Senator also mentioned we only had
 
00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:35.579 align:start position:0%
one meeting in 2022 which created a
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
number of different problems for the
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
board many of them which were very
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
significant with regards to licensing
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
issues approval of courses Etc honey
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
Hastings was in contact with me to
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
discuss this problem over the the course
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
of the past year and together with other
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
mediators there was discussion about
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
making Necessary changes and updating
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
the the statute with regard to our
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
Quorum and what you have before you is
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
the product of that work
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
um I I'm very uh be very happy to
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
explain any parts of this new
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that you may have I would
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
point out that in reading it again
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday I realized that uh maybe honey
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
had overlooked something
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
um in that one of her last conversations
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
she had with me was she was proposing to
 
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
eliminate a New Hampshire bar member on
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
the board and in our discussion I
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
um urged her not to consider doing that
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
and to leave the bar member in there but
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
I realize now
 
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
um she did again by way of this
 
00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
statutory draft include the bar member
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
but under 3C it reads that a quorum
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
shall be half of the membership
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
this statutory
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
um provision would provide that five
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
members of the board are appointed by
 
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
one the judge is appointed by the
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
administrative judge so it's not it's
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
not subject to appointment by the
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
governor so I think that that was just
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
an ambiguity that she made a change by
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
adding the lawyer back in but not
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
changing that provision I think that
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
that may lead to an ambiguity with
 
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
regard to 3C and if I might suggest
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
perhaps that language could basically
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
just be revised to read that a quorum
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
shell be three members appointed by the
 
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.410 align:start position:0%
shell be three members appointed by the
governor

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
again five according to this
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
um legislative proposal would be
 
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and this
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
simply indicate that three
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
according to the structure of this this
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
bill three would be the Baseline Quorum
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
necessary for the board to act or have
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh any formal votes and I think that
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
um I would like to try to address your
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
question about that if I understood it
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't be reducing the number of
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
of members needed to be physically
 
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.629 align:start position:0%
of members needed to be physically
present

00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
below three
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
and if there were not going to be three
 
00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.459 align:start position:0%
members present out of a board meeting
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
the board could not proceed with any
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
formal votes on any any business
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative blackis
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
I think with the change of proposing and
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
the language to make it uh three members
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
then clearly it wouldn't drop but I
 
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
think the existing language
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
um the Quorum would automatically drop
 
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
if you had vacant seats and it could
 
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
drop down to one I mean that's how I
 
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
read the language but with the change
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're proposing that wouldn't be an
 
00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
issue but but the the the board could
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
not proceed with meetings well except
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
instead of quorums originally instead of
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
follow-ups Quorum shall be half the
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
membership appointed by the governor and
 
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
Council vacancies shall not count and so
 
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
if you had let's say all seats
 
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.389 align:start position:0%
if you had let's say all seats
um

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
vacant other than one that was appointed
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
by the governor the clear meaning of the
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
language is that they could have a
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
meeting and take action with one member
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
I don't see how to read it otherwise
 
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm missing something I think that
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
your suggestion of just changing that to
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
three makes very unambiguous
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:38.749 align:start position:0%
very much
unambiguous

00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
yes I know that she was thinking of four
 
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
um at the time and that's why I think
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
she shared the language in there it
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
would be cut to you know one half of the
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
members but again in a a final
 
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.230 align:start position:0%
members but again in a a final
discussion

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
um uh there had been a decision to keep
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
the the lawyer member as a member of the
 
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.970 align:start position:0%
the the lawyer member as a member of the
board

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:05.809 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
what else I would I have one question do
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know how many family mediators are
 
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.949 align:start position:0%
you know how many family mediators are
certified

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
the last time that there was a
 
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
discussion on this I believe the
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
response was 61. 61. apparently I should
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
point out that close enough certified
 
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
family mediator serve in all the courts
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
and the family courts in the state of
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I I presently serve in
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
Brentwood okay let's I just want to know
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
if we how many people we're dealing with
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
um over the last year when you've had 11
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
out of 12 meetings canceled due to lack
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
of Quorum how many people on average
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
were available for those meetings
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
are our Quorum
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
um came down to five well yeah I
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
understand that but so you sent out a
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
memo saying
 
00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
um can you come how many people on
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
average responded Yes I can be there for
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
each meeting so did you have three
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
respondents who said yes we would have
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
been able to make it we would have had a
 
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
quorum under this but we can't meet the
 
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
five standard
 
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
five standard
foreign

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
we seem to always have one one person
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
who could not make it and and we were at
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
five members and we needed a quorum of
 
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.590 align:start position:0%
five members and we needed a quorum of
five

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
gotcha I don't know if that answered
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
your question it does yes thank you yeah
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
I was a follow-up real quick
 
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
um I was under the assumption that you
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
had 11 people on the board and you
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
couldn't make the Quorum but you only
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
had five members on the board and you
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
needed all five to make the Quorum I
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
think another thing that might help you
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
um the statute
 
00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
um that exists right now recites to be a
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
judge and a mural Master the mayoral
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
Master retired and there are no more
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
Maryland Masters in New Hampshire
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
um for over two years we were not able
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
to find a mental health member to to
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
join the board and we were not able to
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
find public members that were willing to
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
voluntarily serve okay so it created a
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
very significant problem for us thank
 
00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
very significant problem for us thank
you

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
it is it is a bill that's very
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
desperately needed
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we hope we will deal
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.610 align:start position:0%
with it
um

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
that's the last card I have on Senate
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
Bill 150 is there anyone else who wishes
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none I will close the public
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
hearing and
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
do you want me to put together an
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
amendment based on the comments that we
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
um today if you want to because I think
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
um there are a few changes that we
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make I believe one had to do
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
with the fee setting
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
right there's two
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll work on it together okay we
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
we don't want to pass the bill as is
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%

um I'm here to
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
um Dan Ennis District Seven Bradford New
 
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:32.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here to introduce Senate bill
 
00:47:32.339 --> 00:47:33.890 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here to introduce Senate bill
147.

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
147.
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill that is brought
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
forward at the request of the board of
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
dental examiners and it has some
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
Provisions in it regarding anesthesia
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
and the administration of such but
 
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
essentially uh it does a couple of
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
things the bill changes the constitution
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
of the board of dental examiners to
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
include a dentist with a current permit
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
to administer anesthesia which I think
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
is an important addition to the board to
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
provide a perspective that isn't
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
presently there and it provides guidance
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
regarding permits to dental facilities
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
and the establishment of qualifications
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
and requirements of facilities where
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
sedation is performed it's pretty
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill I think it does
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
some very good things particularly
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
around anesthesia and getting more of a
 
00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
voice in that area and as we know
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
anesthesia is an important and
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
um an important medical procedure but
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
one that needs careful monitoring and
 
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
should be watched by the board so with
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
that if there are any basic questions
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take those but I know there
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
are some folks behind me who will
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
testify to this bill who have much more
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
knowledge on the subject than I
 
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%

00:48:41.339 --> 00:48:42.770 align:start position:0%

primarily that the administration of
 
00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:46.940 align:start position:0%
either moderate or deep
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
sedation or anesthesia for children
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
eight years and younger and the language
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
is language that was agreed to by the
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dental society and the
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
oral and
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
maxillofacial I think I got that right
 
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.470 align:start position:0%
maxillofacial I think I got that right
surgeons

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
surgeons
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
and so that's the language that you will
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
see the one thing that I will point out
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
the addition that looks a little strange
 
00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
is amending section five
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
if you look at your copy of the Senate
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
amended bill
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
Section 5 is on the very back page and
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
if you look at line seven
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
I haven't to notice that to read as
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
follows is repeated twice so I figured
 
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
while we were doing the amendment I'd
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for re explaining that it
 
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
looked like this the second page of the
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
amendment was missing right
 
00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
okay so if there are any questions if
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
there are any technical questions
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
some of the dentists and representatives
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
behind me would be glad to answer them
 
00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:05.900 align:start position:0%
and are there any questions
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
00:51:08.339 --> 00:51:08.990 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
chair

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
um just looking at the first section uh
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
requiring the dentist member shall have
 
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
a current permit to administer general
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
anesthesia anesthesia and deep sedation
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
um there are five year terms on the
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
board this takes place 60 days after
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
passage is there an open seat to be
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
filled with that at the moment or how is
 
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
that going to be handled I'm sorry I'm
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
having difficulty hearing I'm sorry uh
 
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative so this bill goes into
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after passage the terms
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
on the board are five years do you know
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
if there's an open seat on the board
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
right now that can be filled by somebody
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
with this criteria or would they have to
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
free one and if so how I do not know I'm
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
assuming uh there are representatives of
 
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
the board here I'm sure they can answer
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%

state our focus is on the practice of

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
full support of this bill as amended and
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
I would like to bring forward if I make
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
I we have a doctors Lori Rosado and Dr
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
Mark Abel who are able to speak to your
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
their professional credentials as they
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
pertain to the use of these amendments
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
but what I will say is that in our
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
opinion this bill uh speaks to some of
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
our core concerns uh if the amendment
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
speaks to uh strengthens the rules uh so
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
that credentials of individuals like the
 
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons in particular are
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
underscored and that patient safety is
 
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
also maintained and furthermore that at
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
um sorry that there are no gaps in in
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
care caused by any changes in in the
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
rules at this time I would like to bring
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
forward uh Dr Laurie Rosado who I
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a question of course
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um just want to
 
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
clarify by the amendment you mean the
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment or the amendment that
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
was just introduced the amendment that
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
question there was amendment that was
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
just introduced by representative
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
schuette okay thank you thank you
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay yes please Dr Rosado
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
was there another question I'm sorry
 
00:54:00.049 --> 00:54:00.059 align:start position:0%
there was another question for me it's
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
over here yes
 
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:05.339 align:start position:0%
so it's okay so anesthesia in dentistry
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
is not new
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering what prompted
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
this change
 
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
as I understand it this was uh an
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that was brought not by the
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners but by uh uh
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
Senator Innis and others in the Senate
 
00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
that they were concerned about uh the
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
impacts of having an additional person
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the room not understanding that and
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
most oral surgeons offices uh they do
 
00:54:31.609 --> 00:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
have additional people they do have a
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
digital training there were a lot of
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised in the Senate
 
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
when the amendment was was offered in
 
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
um questions about what are the
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
credentials of oral surgeons do they
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
have safety protocols in place and uh
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
and to be frank I think the Senate ran
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
out of time before crossover uh and
 
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring it to the house to
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
answer some of those more detailed
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
questions which is where this amendment
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
came from thank you thank you
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
representative I do I have a question
 
00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
was this in um a result of the audit of
 
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
the board of dental examiners this
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
amendment representative the bill the
 
00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
bill I believe was a standard rules
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
package as I said the the final
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
amendment that pertains to lifting the
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
exemption for oral surgeons that was
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
brought separately not by the board's
 
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
design it was an amendment that was
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
brought by uh in the Senate
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
Dr Rosado
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Dr Laurie Rosado
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
I'm a practicing dentist here in Concord
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
I'm also the chair of the governmental
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
Affairs Council for the New Hampshire
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
Dental Society I'm also the volunteer
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
dentist that serves 10 public schools in
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
the Concord area in surrounding towns
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
as a dentist who sees children a fair
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
amount of children patient safety is
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
obviously Paramount whether it's for
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
children or anybody but here we're
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
speaking about children
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
although nationally it's very rare to
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
have a patient death under anesthesia
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's a concern here it's very rare
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate to that's never happened
 
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
because of the procedures and protocols
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
that have always been put in place oral
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
surgeons have always practiced under an
 
00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
exemption for decades or or longer and
 
00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
that's always what's been in place
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's what's being asked to change
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
through this bill and through this
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and we do support the
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative shewitt
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
has put forward to change the age frame
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
of which oral surgeons or dental
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists can sedate a patient
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
as a solo practitioner again oral
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
surgeon specifically I've always
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
practiced with trained providers with
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
them they're not oral surgeons their
 
00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
assistants that go through a far more
 
00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
Advanced Training System than your
 
00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
typical dental assistants they go
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
through what's called a dance training
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
which is a dental anesthesia training so
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons in the state have always
 
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
practiced extremely safety having those
 
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
types of assistance present
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
as a general dentist I'm not qualified
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
to administer moderate or deep sedation
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
and I can't answer a lot of questions on
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
that we have experts in the room for
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
that however as a provider of Children's
 
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
Dental Care I can tell you how a dentist
 
00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.410 align:start position:0%
Dental Care I can tell you how a dentist
um

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:23.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
engages into a situation where a child
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
needs to be sedated so for instance a
 
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
child comes to my office that has a
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
severe Dental infection that I'm not and
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
they need sedation for that whether it's
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
due to anxiety or medical history Etc
 
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
they need they need sedation I then
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
refer to an oral surgeon usually I can
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
refer to a pediatric dentist who then
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
can find appropriate measures of
 
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
sedation however pediatric dentists
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
usually can't do that immediately
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
because they can't do that within their
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
office themselves they rely on a
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
hospital setting or other modes of
 
00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
treatment an oral surgeon can sedate the
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
child if they deem the child is is
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
capable to undergo sedation and again
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's parameters that they look at
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
with that being age Airway size weight
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
and other things and ages and always the
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
the determining factor it's the size of
 
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
the child Etc again there's experts in
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
the room that can speak to that
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
the one thing that we get concerned
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
about is is if there if if this
 
00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:24.059 align:start position:0%
exemption is taken away from the oral
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
surgeon this adds a lot of cost to the
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
parent of the child a cost in the realm
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
of 800 to a thousand dollars now we
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
can't let cost be the determining Factor
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
here safety has to be the number one
 
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
factor here
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
um of which we've always had that in our
 
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:40.730 align:start position:0%
um of which we've always had that in our
state

00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
um but the the if we cannot have the
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons do this and they do need
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
to have that added provider you are
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
looking at a cost of 800 to a thousand
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
dollars to bring someone else into the
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
office most of which many of these
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
children are Medicaid children of which
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
the parents can't afford the 800 to a
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars the other option that
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
surgeons have to do that they could do
 
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
is bring the child to the hospital to be
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
sedated that's increased cost sometimes
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
upwards of two thousand dollars for
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
anesthesia there
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
as well the more concern there is that
 
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
the child is then going to go through a
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
waiting period And if they have a dental
 
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
infection that usually can't wait
 
00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:17.750 align:start position:0%
infection that usually can't wait
um

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the public always
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
knows how severe a dental infection can
 
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
become uh they look at it is there just
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
baby teeth and these aren't just baby
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
teeth dental infections can become very
 
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
serious in children I'll give you the
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
name of a child in in the state of
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
Maryland that died due to a dental
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
infection several years ago with
 
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
Diamante driver he lived in the in
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
within the Baltimore area and if you
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
look up that case it was quite quite
 
00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
frightening because the patient
 
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
developed an infection that couldn't be
 
00:59:49.609 --> 00:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
seen in a timely manner we don't have
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
that issue here in the state of New
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we know that all
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
children will be seen in a timely manner
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's a very cohesive State the dentist
 
00:59:58.609 --> 00:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
work very closely with their oral
 
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
surgeons and it's never been an issue to
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
get a child treated in a safe manner so
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
lift in the exemption completely
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
um does pose some questions but at a
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
bare minimum we would you know would
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
never want to see it lifted for over the
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
age of eight we know that will make it
 
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
even more difficult but under the age of
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
eight we're willing to agree to that
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment as it is right now under the
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
age of eight most oral surgeons aren't
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
sedating those patients anyways I don't
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
think there's a neural surgeon in the
 
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
state that would ever it's a data one
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
year old in their practice you know and
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
and usually one-year-olds don't need to
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
be sedated for a tooth infection anyways
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
those will usually do for other
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
procedures like they can't nurse well on
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
the mother is trying to nurse and they
 
01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
need a procedure done for that so I feel
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
that you know I know I shouldn't say I
 
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
feel I know that this state provides
 
01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
very very safe care and I will leave it
 
01:00:52.609 --> 01:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
to your decision as to whether you want
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
to change this to have an amendment of
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
eight and under
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
knowing that we are going to pose an
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
access to care issue with that and I
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
have my written test domain that goes
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
over all those details that I'm happy to
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
provide to you and I want you also to
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
feel very comfortable asking us
 
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
questions and to ask the experts in the
 
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
room the questions as well thank you
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I'm a little
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
bit confused doctor uh you did say that
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
you support representative schuert's
 
01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:29.339 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh do you have do you have
 
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
some problems with the amendment even
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
though you're supporting it because it I
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't my only concern is I know there
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
could be an access to care issue because
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
you may have a six-year-old with an
 
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
infected tooth that has high anxiety
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
Then an oral surgeon could sedate with
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
very very light sedation they remember
 
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
they are not doing deep sedation like a
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
hospital anesthesiologist does they're
 
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
doing light sedation so the oral surgeon
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
could take that six-year-old do light
 
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
sedation have the tooth out in probably
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
30 seconds or last week the child up
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
child won't remember anything the child
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
might be screaming and crying but they
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
won't remember anything and the
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
procedure is done within minutes whereas
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
now that six-year-old needs to go to the
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
hospital which will delay care cause
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
extra cost
 
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
it's just an it will affect access to
 
01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:20.099 align:start position:0%
care you know but
 
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's just a decision you guys have to
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
make at a bare minimum we would we
 
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to see that happen over
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
the age of eight though
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
and somehow the the amendment would
 
01:02:30.359 --> 01:02:31.870 align:start position:0%
and somehow the the amendment would
would

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
force that to happen more often or
 
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:39.059 align:start position:0%
at all well what the amendment does it
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
is it will cause anyone under the age of
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
eight to have to go into a different
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
sedation setting the oral surgeon would
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
have to call a second provider in and if
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
that child presents you know at two
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
where's the oral surgeon going to get
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
that second anesthesia provider they're
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
either going to have to call someone and
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
say we have to postpone this till
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or if they can come tomorrow I
 
01:03:04.609 --> 01:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
don't know you know they don't have
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
people at at their fingertips to just
 
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
show up at their office to be the second
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
provider of anesthesia on an immediate
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
basis or they have to get us get it
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
scheduled in the operating room which is
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to be delay of treatment and
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
increase costs either way it's going to
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
increase costs more of the concern is
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
the delay of treatment without with a
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
dental infection
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt the amendment
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
changes the age from 13 to 8. which
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
expands the number of
 
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
older children who can be treated I get
 
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
that part it's just as she indicated
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
they support the amendment and yet we do
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
support the amendment because I guess I
 
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
know what you're saying like why support
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
the amendment at all if there's going to
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
be an access to care issue well we're up
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
against a big fight and we don't want to
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
this to to come across as us not wanting
 
01:04:04.849 --> 01:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
safety for children we absolutely do but
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh so we're willing to take something
 
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:09.380 align:start position:0%
may I
 
01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:12.859 align:start position:0%
say that the amendment lowers the age
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
for special treatment for children from
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
13 to 8 which you fully support and it
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
has some exemptions for younger people
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh including experienced dentists who
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
have dealt with children in the past
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
correct so I just to kind of take us
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
back a step we've never had oral
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
surgeons have always been under an
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
exemption that they can treat any age
 
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:39.059 align:start position:0%
then recently it came up that it would
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
be 13 and under and then with you know
 
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
the recent questions and Etc that have
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
happened in the last couple weeks we
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
said well then we'll go eight and under
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
but this isn't us that are putting that
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
forward this was something that was
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
given to the the dental profession prior
 
01:04:59.809 --> 01:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
to that they could sedate any age right
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
and even with this a dentist or an oral
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
surgeon who has been dealing 20 patients
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
in two years which is a relatively small
 
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
number I would imagine would be exempt
 
01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
from needing a second
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist is that correct correct
 
01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.890 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist is that correct correct
okay

01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
so it will
 
01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.690 align:start position:0%
so it will
essentially

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.549 align:start position:0%
essentially
create

01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
create
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
or tend to because they if they can do
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
it without a second person
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
they will they'll be able to do so more
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
easily and more rapidly
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
correct so the correct
 
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:45.890 align:start position:0%
correct so the correct
um

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
essentially you will be allowing
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
Specialists to in dealing except for the
 
01:05:55.329 --> 01:05:55.339 align:start position:0%
age under eight except for under eight
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
especially specifically for eight eight
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
and under regardless this amendment is
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
still saying that the oral surgeons
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
cannot treat eight and under
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
um ex the exempt from this requirement
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
if they had personal Administration for
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
20 patients in the last two years
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
that's the qualifications for all oral
 
01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:17.210 align:start position:0%
that's the qualifications for all oral
surgeons

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
surgeons
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
no this is specifically to be exempt
 
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
from the requirement to have a dedicated
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
anesthesia physiologist
 
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.230 align:start position:0%
anesthesia physiologist
present

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
if you look at the amendment that's line
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
17 oh sorry I'm I'm sorry if I may I
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
think Dr Abel who is our oral surgeon
 
01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
can give you better understanding of his
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
qualifications as they would be defined
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
in this new section under representative
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
schwitz uh Amendment okay but what we
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
are talking about is strengthening uh
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
the oral surgeons qualifications for
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
that exemption as you indicated
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
represent representative and also
 
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
focusing the uh the exemption on
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
children who are most vulnerable and
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
that is the eight and under population
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you in that case I I
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
think we should hear from Dr Abel
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
except reps down black us uh yeah for
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
the uh for the dentist uh there who
 
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.349 align:start position:0%
the uh for the dentist uh there who
spoke

01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
um if I understood you correctly you
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
said there's never been a uh death
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
related to uh anesthesia related to
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
Dentistry correct all right and in New
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in New Hampshire
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
um so my question is
 
01:07:30.119 --> 01:07:30.770 align:start position:0%
um so my question is
um

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:32.809 --> 01:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
looking for your position on this bill
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
either with or without the amendment do
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
you do you actually see if there hasn't
 
01:07:38.329 --> 01:07:38.339 align:start position:0%
been a problem do you see a need at all
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
for any of this
 
01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:41.210 align:start position:0%
for any of this
no

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt well the thing is
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
I uh I I get it that you know dealing
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
with small children is a is obviously a
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
problem uh for Dennis you're you're
 
01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
they're not only very young they are
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
very small everything is smaller uh you
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
know I haven't seen a newborn baby for a
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
long time but I remember seeing a a uh a
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
very a preemie that was about the size
 
01:08:13.079 --> 01:08:14.029 align:start position:0%
very a preemie that was about the size
of

01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
one could hold the child in one hand uh
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
and so so but there is surgery is being
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
done on on children on babies in utero
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
in on occasion right uh but also very
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
very very young yes
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
say again your question is and my
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
question is so the the thing is that the
 
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
the question of special costs and
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
special permission and special training
 
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
but this is not just limited to
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
Dentistry there there's surgery is being
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
performed on very small children in case
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
of life-threatening Metals medical
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
situations so uh we wanna
 
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
be very careful with regard to the
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
advice we're getting whether this is
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do since this is a
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
medical situation and and and uh so I'm
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
I think we want to pursue the situation
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
with your colleague thank you thank you
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative I have a question
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
from Mr Auerbach
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
um benefit of having a member of the
 
01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
board that is that has a permit to
 
01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
board that is that has a permit to
administer

01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
administer
 
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia and deep sedation
 
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
let's just forget the rest of the bill
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
but if they're I mean that would make
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
sense to me but I would like your
 
01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.070 align:start position:0%
sense to me but I would like your
concurrence

01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
concurrence
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I just want to
 
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm clear you're asking if do
 
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
I see the benefit of an oral surgeon who
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
is exempt from this from uh a waiver
 
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
as they currently exist okay is it
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
beneficial to have an orange oral
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
surgeon a member of this board since
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
they are not currently a member of the
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
board yeah I'm sorry yes yes
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative uh the the I must uh
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
confess as I said earlier the uh the
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
final piece of this bill the way the
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
lifting of the exemption was not the
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
board's original design for SB 147. uh
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
it was actually added on uh in the
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
legislative process because while the
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners was working on
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
rules pertaining to this very issue and
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
those rules have taken admittedly quite
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
some time uh to clarify it's had some
 
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
input from from uh General dentists it
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
has been put from people who are not
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
subject to the board's rules it's been
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh creating quite a quite a long process
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately some who were
 
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
concerned that it was taking too long or
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
did not have it going their way went to
 
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
to the to the legislature to speed up
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
the process by lifting proposing to lift
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
the exemption for oral surgeons that's
 
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
where we rested in the Senate uh the
 
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
final bill there's actually another bill
 
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
SB 91 which was introducing just the
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
lifting of this bill of this exemption
 
01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
that was re-referred back to committee
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
but the amendment was tacked on lifting
 
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
the exemption which is why
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative schuett and her wisdom
 
01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
looked at this worked working with us to
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
clarify on the areas that we feel are
 
01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
really of major Focus for patient safety
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh so there's there's a number of
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
different uh flows that are going on
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
here uh from our standpoint this could
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
have been avoided frankly if an oral
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
surgeon was on the board of dental
 
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
examiners there's not been a board a
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
dental oral surgeon on the board of
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
dental examiners four years now uh that
 
01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
individual could have provided a great
 
01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
deal of insight into the rule making
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
process and might not have necessitated
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
this individual or the proponents of SB
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
91 to come to the legislature
 
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gerhart thank
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just for clarification's
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
sake this increased
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic tape is this going to
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
increase delays to care
 
01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
I know every every field saying it's
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
hard to get people to do everything
 
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
right now just labor shortage so with
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
this increase the time needed to
 
01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
actually get surgeries done and if so I
 
01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
know you can't give me an exact but is
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
this is there something you can speak to
 
01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
As in that regard I just want to make
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
sure I thank you representative for your
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
question I just want to make sure I'm
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
clear on your question you're asking if
 
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
this if the exemption is lifted will
 
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
this create more or are you talking
 
01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
about the general provisions of the SB
 
01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.990 align:start position:0%
about the general provisions of the SB
147

01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
147
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
just if this was to go into effect
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
timeline basis is this looking to
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
increase the weights or inclusive of the
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
amendment from representative Jewett uh
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
we feel that
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
um well right now there is a weightless
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
there is a weight for this type of care
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh we feel that if you're going to
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
impose upon oral surgeons who already
 
01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
have staff dedicated and Dr Abel can
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
give you a better glimpse of what goes
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
on in an oral surgeon's operatory
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
um if this exemption is lifted they're
 
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
going to have to bring in another person
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
is Dr Rosado mentioned earlier you you
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
can't just pick up the phone and call
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
somebody and have them come in on a
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
weekend for an emergency there are going
 
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
to be delays
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
um and you know as Dr Rosado mentioned
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
if an infection comes it could be an
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
overnight event where somebody's in the
 
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
hospital or something terrible further
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
happens so we do not want to create any
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
situation right now that lengthens the
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
weight for dental care
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much Dr Rosado
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.510 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
committee

01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
um my name is Mark Dr Mark Abel I am a
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
resident of Bedford and I'm an oral
 
01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
surgeon who practices in Manchester I am
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
also the most uh recent former chair of
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
the anesthesia committee for the New
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Society of oral and
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
Maxillofacial Surgeons and in years past
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
I've actually testified in the
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislature before on matters related to
 
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
dental office anesthesia
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm okay with 90 of SB 147 as
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
originally written but I'm here today to
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
express concern about the amendment that
 
01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
was passed at the last minute in the
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
Senate uh to remove the exemption
 
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
um for oral surgeons to provide deep
 
01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
sedation anesthesia to patients under
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
age 13. the amendment's proponents
 
01:14:59.810 --> 01:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
lacked a full understanding of the
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
clinical safeguards already in place as
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
well as the professional and ethical
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
standards that we must already abide by
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
to maintain our credentials like nearly
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
1 000 fellow New Hampshire licensed
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
Dental colleagues and more than two
 
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
dozen oral surgeons practicing in New
 
01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.709 align:start position:0%
dozen oral surgeons practicing in New
Hampshire

01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I am committed to the safety of my
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
patients as an oral surgeon I routinely
 
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
am called upon to provide deep sedation
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
anesthesia for my pediatric patients
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
membership in our Professional
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
Organization requires that my intent
 
01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
that my entire office team is on point
 
01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
performing regular frequent emergency
 
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
training drills and that my facility is
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
well equipped to rescue children of all
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
ages from medical emergencies this
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
mandatory preparation is already further
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
enforced by the board of dental
 
01:15:53.219 --> 01:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
enforced by the board of dental
examiners

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
examiners
 
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
and during the anesthesia permitting
 
01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:57.830 align:start position:0%
and during the anesthesia permitting
process

01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
furthermore when I am providing sedation
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
to patients at any age my staff and I
 
01:16:04.729 --> 01:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
all monitor our patients to make sure
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
that they remain comfortably and safely
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
safely asleep under deep sedation
 
01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
in the development of this legislation
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
there has been some confusion as to the
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
age of the children affected I believe
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
that the amendment offered by
 
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative schuitt provides Clarity
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
focusing on the youngest pediatric
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
patients who are most at risk of an
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
adverse incident
 
01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
by nine years of age a child's cardio
 
01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
respiratory system becomes more similar
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
to that of older children and adults
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
so Dr schuett's Amendment ensures that
 
01:16:42.649 --> 01:16:42.659 align:start position:0%
those dentists who seek an exemption to
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
administer deep sedation anesthesia to
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
children ages 8 and under have a record
 
01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
of frequent experience treating the
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
youngest of kids
 
01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
orthodontists frequently request for
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons to surgically expose
 
01:16:59.630 --> 01:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
unerupted teeth on children as young as
 
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
nine years of age under anesthesia we
 
01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
are focusing on ages eight and under
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
because I believe that strengthening the
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
requirements of the exemption for oral
 
01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:12.659 align:start position:0%
surgeons to administer anesthesia to
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
children ages eight and under goes
 
01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:16.739 align:start position:0%
further to protect patients than
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
removing the exemption altogether the
 
01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:21.659 align:start position:0%
latter creates a gap in care for
 
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
children aged 9 to 12 years those by
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
requiring a separate anesthetist when
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
they are not necessary or by moving
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
these children to an already
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
understaffed and oral and overburdened
 
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
Hospital environment potentially
 
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
increasing costs for patients it is for
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
these reasons that I ask the committee
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
to vote that this bill ought to pass as
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
amended by representative shewitt thank
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
you and I'm happy to take any of your
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative blackis this is
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh basically the same question I asked
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
before given that apparent complete safe
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
safe history in the State uh handling
 
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
anesthesia for dental uh
 
01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.110 align:start position:0%
anesthesia for dental uh
purposes

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
do you actually see a need for this bill
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
with or without the proposed amendment
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh yes I see a need for the bill with
 
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment
 
01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.390 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment
um

01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
anesthesia permitting is a serious issue
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
and the oral surgery Community takes the
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
issue very seriously
 
01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:25.100 align:start position:0%
we understand that there have been some
 
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
sensationalized Adverse Events and uh
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
some deaths of patients in dental
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
offices under anesthesia in other states
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
and we take the knowledge that we've
 
01:18:39.169 --> 01:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
learned from those experiences from our
 
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
colleagues in other states very
 
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.630 align:start position:0%
colleagues in other states very
seriously

01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
and there is something to be gained by
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
having these additional requirements for
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
children ages eight and under we
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
actually were working with
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
representative shua to to really improve
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
the current statutes so that they will
 
01:18:59.450 --> 01:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
provide the best patient safety for New
 
01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
I should
 
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
um Dr able would you agree with with my
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
conclusion that this will
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
essentially create a group of oral
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
surgeons who specialize in treating
 
01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.030 align:start position:0%
surgeons who specialize in treating
children

01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
I think that's correct I think there
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
already are Madam chairs oral surgeons
 
01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.149 align:start position:0%
already are Madam chairs oral surgeons
who

01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:19:26.689 --> 01:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
have that as kind of their focus like I
 
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
was saying you know the majority of oral
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
surgeons do treat children ages nine and
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
over regularly but certainly when you go
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
into that younger age group eight and
 
01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.149 align:start position:0%
into that younger age group eight and
under

01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it would make sense to have some sort
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
of extra requirement that they prove
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
that they treat this these kids
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
regularly so that they can have the
 
01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.669 align:start position:0%
regularly so that they can have the
exemption

01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative true and then Schmidt
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:19:59.630 --> 01:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking my question
 
01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.610 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking my question
um

01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
see 20 patients under eight
 
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.250 align:start position:0%
see 20 patients under eight
no

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
no I don't
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
um could you give us an idea of what
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
would go on
 
01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
in your office representative
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
but you speak into your mind thank you
 
01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if if you were to be treating
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh a child under eight would you ever
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
treat a child a day yes so if you were
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
what's going on in your office yesterday
 
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
putting that child under sedation
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
which would be different than if the
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
So currently under current statute oral
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
surgeons are allowed to be Exempted from
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
their requirement for a separate
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
anesthetist as long as the board has
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
created rules that allow for that and
 
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
the board of dental examiners has
 
01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:05.420 align:start position:0%
allowed oral surgeons to be Exempted
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
so because of that I could bring in a
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
younger child and provide the anesthesia
 
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.130 align:start position:0%
younger child and provide the anesthesia
myself

01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
um and I am trained to do so
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
um it's just that I don't do that
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
regularly uh younger children
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
proportionally they do have larger
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
tongues larger tonsils smaller uh noses
 
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
there are you know different physiologic
 
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
parameters that need to be managed more
 
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
carefully in a younger child
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
so it just I I think even though the
 
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.430 align:start position:0%
so it just I I think even though the
current

01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
you know statute would require would
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
allow for me to do it I think it makes
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
sense for patient safety in that eight
 
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
and underpopulation just as the chair
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
was saying to have that extra you know
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
justification that you do this regularly
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
that you're a specialist in the area
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you had a
 
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.709 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you had a
question

01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh I I appreciate your
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
strong endorsement of Representative
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
schwart's amendment is this a situation
 
01:22:13.090 --> 01:22:13.100 align:start position:0%
where we would be better if the
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
legislature stayed the hell out of it uh
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
because I you know
 
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether uh we're mucking
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
around in areas we know nothing about
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
I mean to be perfectly honest with you a
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative we've been so grateful
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
that representative schuett has has
 
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
worked with us
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
um that we've really
 
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
you know we've we've helped give our
 
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
input into the amendment in such a way
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
that we think it's very fair and in fact
 
01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
it it improves patient safety so to tell
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
you the truth I think this is an area
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
where the the legislature could be
 
01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:49.370 align:start position:0%
where the the legislature could be
helpful

01:22:49.370 --> 01:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
um and because the board
 
01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.270 align:start position:0%
um and because the board
um

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know they have had discussions about
 
01:22:59.330 --> 01:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
adding rules about anesthesia but um
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
they they had not officially made any
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh rules that were passed regarding it
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
that I think this legislature could
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
contribute to in a helpful manner
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative me a
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
so uh it strikes me that
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
um that there is another body involved
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
here uh and it seems that the senate had
 
01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.149 align:start position:0%
here uh and it seems that the senate had
some

01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:23:26.159 --> 01:23:27.910 align:start position:0%
some
uh

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
involvement in the in the current state
 
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
of the legis this legislation that was
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
perhaps unfavorable uh uh to the degree
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
that we change the bill it's going to
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
have to go back to the Senate even if it
 
01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
passes the house
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
um and and uh is this is it same to you
 
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:51.140 align:start position:0%
that that this is uh
 
01:23:54.649 --> 01:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
possibly a fraud situation
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
well the the meat of this bill is very
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
helpful uh remember it's it's requiring
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
that one of the members on the Dental
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
Board is an anesthesia permit holder
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's very important
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
um it it creates this facility permit
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
for dental offices to be permitted to
 
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
provide anesthesia in their facility and
 
01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
it actually also creates an anesthesia
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
Committee of the Dental Board which
 
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
previously had not been legislatively
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
created so those things are that's the
 
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
meat of the bill and that's very
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
important really the the issue that
 
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
needed to be tweaked if you will was
 
01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
this this issue of the age of pediatric
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
patients which I feel that we have given
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
our input on uh very you know with
 
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
representative shewitt in a helpful way
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
one follow-up one final question so how
 
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:43.100 align:start position:0%
many people I this is a small state
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
billion three uh and and uh how many
 
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
patients are we dealing I mean I
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
understand one child that dies is one
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
child too many but uh but to the degree
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
we create a structure that's designed
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
for uh extremely extremely rare
 
01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
situations is is uh representation
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I think that question belongs in
 
01:25:11.209 --> 01:25:11.219 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and I hope well I'm
 
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
glad to hear I'm glad to hear it's going
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
to subcommitting it's going to be my
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
question I definitely need to overdraw
 
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
so if we were to leave the bill as is
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
I'm over here I'm so sorry if we were to
 
01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
leave the bill as is
 
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
but remove
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
the qualifications just remove H I'm
 
01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
just I just pretend that that doesn't
 
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
that isn't there right now which is the
 
01:25:40.189 --> 01:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
part that we're talking about
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
is that something that with the new bore
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
structure you could put together rules
 
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be amenable or is this a
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
guard rail that you would want I guess
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
be the both of you I mean is it better
 
01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
to have it done in rule making or do you
 
01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
do we want to put it in statute
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
so H I'm talking about H specifically
 
01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.189 align:start position:0%
so H I'm talking about H specifically
yeah

01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
H H uh which used to be G
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
um was created in 2018 uh by a house
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
bill called hb1577 which I actually
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
testified it before the Health and Human
 
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
Services Committee in both the House and
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
Senate for and there was a lot of
 
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
discussion at that time about whether
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
children needed uh to have further
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
regulation from the legislature to
 
01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:32.219 align:start position:0%
receive anesthesia and dental offices
 
01:26:32.219 --> 01:26:33.770 align:start position:0%
receive anesthesia and dental offices
and

01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
um we've always felt that that g now H
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
could be improved and so this is an
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that I think that the
 
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
wording and representative schuett's
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
amendment is excellent and I think that
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
would if if the committee and the
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
legislature adopted that that would be
 
01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
legislature adopted that that would be
helpful

01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you this this
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%

01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative Sherwood subcommittee
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative schuette yes

largest providers of dental anesthesia

hundred patients per year and 44 percent

general anesthesia for their dental work
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%

for Pediatric patients
 
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
why are they opposed they are opposed to
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
have the dentist do the Deep sedation

01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%

01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%

01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
doing the procedure and the sedation it
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
is made up of a team that team consists
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
of the dentist providing the anesthesia
 
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
and the surgical procedure as well as
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
generally two assistants
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
the issue is not about the the dentist
 
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
being able to provide the anesthesia and
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
their capabilities because they are
 
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
qualified to do so the issue really
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
boils down to their team and how their
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
team is able to provide emergency care
 
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
to a pediatric patient should an
 
01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
emergency arrive
 
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
the assistants that make up this team
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
that the dentist will heads
 
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
are dental assistants their scope or
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
practice does not allow them to provide
 
01:30:41.209 --> 01:30:41.219 align:start position:0%
life-saving medications for anesthesia
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
or reversal medications they cannot drop
 
01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
the medications they cannot give the
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
medications they cannot start an
 
01:30:50.689 --> 01:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
intravenous line they cannot manage an
 
01:30:50.699 --> 01:30:52.490 align:start position:0%
intravenous line they cannot manage an
airway

01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
airway
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
this makes the dentist the only person
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
in that room in a pediatric emergency to
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
care for that patient
 
01:31:02.209 --> 01:31:02.219 align:start position:0%
the only person
 
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
unless the assistant is going to do
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
something outside their scope of
 
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.090 align:start position:0%
something outside their scope of
practice

01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 147 has amended the original
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill as amended
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
does places a dedicated anesthesia
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
provider separate from the dentist which
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
is the gold standard and the standard of
 
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
care hospitals and surgery centers where
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
deep sedation and general anesthesia is
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
administered to Pediatric patients
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
this affords the Pediatric patient a
 
01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
greater level of safety should an
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
emergency arise you have two medically
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
trained individuals the anesthesia
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
provider and the dentist
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
that are capable of providing
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
life-saving measures to that child
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
and a team approach with two qualified
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
highly trained providers the dentist and
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
the separate anesthesia provider will
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
always be better than a single provider
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
doing it alone
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
the amendment that is opposed that has
 
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
been proposed by representative Schuler
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
is not in line with actually the current
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
language that the board of dentistry has
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
proposed as rule changing
 
01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:03.169 align:start position:0%
proposed as rule changing
um

01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
the interesting part is is that this
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
proposes that a provider of Dentistry
 
01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
that does less than one pediatric
 
01:32:14.290 --> 01:32:14.300 align:start position:0%
patient a month is qualified to provide
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and the surgical procedure to
 
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
that patient
 
01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
We Do 50 in a month
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's a huge difference in experience and
 
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
level of exposure to that those kinds of
 
01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.110 align:start position:0%
level of exposure to that those kinds of
emergencies

01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
as far as additional costs there will be
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
no additional costs the current dentist
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
is paid for both the surgery and the
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
anesthesia in this current model
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
when a separate anesthesia is anesthesia
 
01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
provider is providing the anesthesia
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
they will be paid for the anesthesia not
 
01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
the dentist and the dentist will be paid
 
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
for the procedure just as in the
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
hospital or the surgery center it does
 
01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
not cost the patient anymore just the
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
dentist will not be paid for the
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
anesthesia the anesthesia provider will
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
be paid for the anesthesia
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
financial burden last year in 2022
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid was billed for 28 cases by
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
dentists providing both the anesthesia
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
and procedure ages 2 to 12 according to
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
Dr Sarah Finney assistant director of
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services at the March board of
 
01:33:15.649 --> 01:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
dentistry meeting
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
multiply that number by 500 percent to
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
compensate for other anesthesia
 
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
companies such as Blue Cross Blue Shield
 
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
Delta Etc that's 140 patients per year
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
with an average anesthesia cost of 850
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
per child
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
that total cost per year is a hundred
 
01:33:34.729 --> 01:33:34.739 align:start position:0%
and nineteen thousand dollars
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
divide that over the approximate 40
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
Dental anesthesia providers that are
 
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
that's a cost of two thousand nine
 
01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy five dollars that is
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
access to care was another concern that
 
01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
they have having a separate anesthesia
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
provider for the surgical provide from
 
01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
the surgical provider will not create an
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
access to care barrier the access to
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
care barrier is the lack of dentists in
 
01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taking medicaid
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
there are only a handful that actually
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
take Medicaid
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
if more dentists took Medicaid there
 
01:34:15.169 --> 01:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
in Senate Bill 147 was amended I would
 
01:34:21.169 --> 01:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
actually recommend an actual language
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
change in line 12 Roman numeral 1A we
 
01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
should it should be changed to the
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and subcommittee to us to be
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
established which shall consist of one
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
dentist member of the board striking who
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
is a permit and uh to administer
 
01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.330 align:start position:0%
is a permit and uh to administer
anesthesia

01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
anesthesia
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
and then for additional dentists should
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
be struck to have licensing anesthesia
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
providers and that are currently
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
permitted to administer anesthesia in a
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
dental office appointed to the board
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
this change would allow providers of
 
01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
anesthesia in the dental office such as
 
01:34:54.490 --> 01:34:54.500 align:start position:0%
Physicians and myself nurse
 
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists the opportunity to
 
01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
guide inform and educate the board of
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
dentistry on non-dental matters related
 
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
to Anesthesia
 
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
in dental offices from a different
 
01:35:05.689 --> 01:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
perspective and create a more
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
well-rounded anesthesia advisory
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
committee to the board of dentistry
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
you'll be available for the subcommittee
 
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh provided I don't have any pediatric
 
01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
patients I'm taking care of and if I do
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
if I can move them yes sir
 
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
doctor thank you for your testimony
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
today how much of a priority was this
 
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
for you to get to the state house today
 
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
to to testify
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
because I notice as you're you're
 
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
talking you feel pretty passionate about
 
01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.830 align:start position:0%
talking you feel pretty passionate about
this

01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
this has been a long road I have tried
 
01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.290 align:start position:0%
this has been a long road I have tried
to

01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
get this to the point where we can
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
provide safer anesthesia care for
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
Pediatric patients for over a year I go
 
01:36:04.129 --> 01:36:04.139 align:start position:0%
to every single board of dentistry
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
meeting or just about every single board
 
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
of dentistry meeting I've had the board
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
of dentistry call me on my personal cell
 
01:36:12.169 --> 01:36:12.179 align:start position:0%
phone to ask me anesthesia questions
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm passionate about this because I
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
feel that though the oral surgeons and
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
dental anesthesiologists they are
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
qualified to give anesthesia that is not
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
the question in case here
 
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
it boils down to what is the safest or a
 
01:36:29.689 --> 01:36:29.699 align:start position:0%
safer way to provide care and anesthesia
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
care specifically deep sedation and
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia to these pediatric
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
patients I had to move my pediatric
 
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
patients today and schedule them for
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
next week on a day that I normally
 
01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have them
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
but the interesting part was when I
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
asked the dentist
 
01:36:48.649 --> 01:36:48.659 align:start position:0%
can I schedule these patients are you
 
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
able to do this with me the answer was
 
01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:54.179 align:start position:0%
yes why because she understands as a
 
01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
pediatric dentist the importance of me
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
being here today to represent the other
 
01:36:59.689 --> 01:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
side of the coin that you're not
 
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who we should
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
testify on Senate Bill 147
 
01:37:13.679 --> 01:37:15.649 align:start position:0%
testify on Senate Bill 147
. uh

01:37:15.649 --> 01:37:15.659 align:start position:0%
. uh
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
director Courtney how nice to see from
 
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:28.430 align:start position:0%
director Courtney how nice to see from
you

01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee Lindsey Courtney executive
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
director oplc I'm not going to address
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
the issue that we've primarily been
 
01:37:40.129 --> 01:37:40.139 align:start position:0%
discussing today but I did want to
 
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
comment on a few technical changes that
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
I think the committee might want to
 
01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:45.410 align:start position:0%
I think the committee might want to
consider

01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
the original Bill SB 147 was requested
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
by the board of dental examiners as a
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
result of the audit findings that I know
 
01:37:55.850 --> 01:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
you have have read the audit or some of
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
the audit and one of the primary issues
 
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
that the board would like to address is
 
01:38:03.850 --> 01:38:03.860 align:start position:0%
the fact that they presently don't
 
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
permit the actual dental facilities they
 
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
permit the dental providers and
 
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of the audit they
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
have looked at other regulatory models
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
um they would like to utilize the model
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
that's utilized in Rhode Island where
 
01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
they regulate the actual facility as
 
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
opposed to the dentist and so that was
 
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
really the uh proposal that's contained
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
in SB 147 I would suggest a couple of
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
minor modifications however under the
 
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
um what I've done to dental examiners
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority ignorance and the
 
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
authority to issue permits to dental
 
01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.010 align:start position:0%
authority to issue permits to dental
facilities

01:38:45.010 --> 01:38:45.020 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
assuming if HB 655 were to pass that
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
would actually conflict with HB 655 and
 
01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
we might recommend mend language setting
 
01:38:58.129 --> 01:38:58.139 align:start position:0%
for it's something like assess or
 
01:39:00.169 --> 01:39:00.179 align:start position:0%
determine eligibility requirements for
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
permits to dental facilities the same is
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
true for
 
01:39:05.159 --> 01:39:05.750 align:start position:0%
true for
um

01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.090 align:start position:0%
um
page

01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
on the last page and I apologize I don't
 
01:39:13.330 --> 01:39:13.340 align:start position:0%
have the amendment but it's section five
 
01:39:16.930 --> 01:39:16.940 align:start position:0%
in line 10 there is a conflict there
 
01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
with respect to the fee setting
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
Authority so we would just request
 
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
um that rather than have the fees set by
 
01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
the board that it be established by the
 
01:39:26.699 --> 01:39:27.830 align:start position:0%
the board that it be established by the
office

01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
would that would be happy to answer any
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I trust you'll be
 
01:39:34.729 --> 01:39:34.739 align:start position:0%
able to assist the subcommittee and
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
including this in any Amendment
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you representative
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
blackis thank you um correct me if I'm
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
wrong but it's my understanding that
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
regular like doctors offices the
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
facility is not licensed but if that's
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
correct then what's the argument for
 
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
doing it for a dental facility so it's
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually administratively it's become
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
um difficult I think to manage because
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
what they've been doing is issuing
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
permits to the actual dental providers
 
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
which and as part of the permitting
 
01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
process and Dwayne Tebow can probably
 
01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
um fill in the blanks if I if I'm not
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
giving all of the information that's
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
necessary but as part of the permeating
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
process they initially go in and do a
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
facility inspection to determine that
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
they have the right equipment and that
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
the hallways you know are sufficiently
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
wide enough and and every time a
 
01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
particular dental provider wishes to
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
receive a permit they have to do that
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
same facility inspection doesn't really
 
01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:39.659 align:start position:0%
make sense so they would prefer to have
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
the facility inspected and permitted so
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
that qualified providers uh
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
can administer anesthesia follow-up so
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
how's that handled in regular doctor's
 
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
office I would think there'd be similar
 
01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:54.659 align:start position:0%
issues or not well the health facilities
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
are licensed under DHHS medical
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
practitioners offices are not licensed
 
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
but ambulatory centers are so there
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
there is regulation I do think that the
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
one area of Health Care Facilities
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's not licensed are practitioners
 
01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:11.410 align:start position:0%
that's not licensed are practitioners
offices

01:41:11.410 --> 01:41:11.420 align:start position:0%
offices
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know it would seem to me that a
 
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
doctor's office is more similar to a
 
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
protect practitioner's office than these
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
other things you're talking about I
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
agree I think the distinction here that
 
01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
the board may suggest is that uh you're
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
only required to be licensed if you
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
intend to
 
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
um utilize anesthesia put somebody under
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.250 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
given the brutal
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
Dental Board
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
audit that we read at the very beginning
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
of this session is now the time to be
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
considering any new bills regarding this
 
01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.570 align:start position:0%
considering any new bills regarding this
change

01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:00.179 align:start position:0%
so the board of dental examiners uh as
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
reflected in the audit does require some
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
additional legislative changes this is
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
what they've proposed the oplc is not
 
01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
taking a position on that but I do think
 
01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
that there there needs to be legislative
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
changes with respect to the permitting
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
process for anesthesia
 
01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.689 align:start position:0%
process for anesthesia
okay

01:42:17.689 --> 01:42:17.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the the audit definitely had
 
01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
sections where legislation was required
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to do we'll have to
 
01:42:25.619 --> 01:42:27.350 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to do we'll have to
cooperate

01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
cooperate
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%

Bill 149 as amended by the Senate as
 
01:43:27.050 --> 01:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
Vice chair of the Hillsborough County
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%

01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
brought um by Senator Rosenwald and
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
myself and other uh legislators within
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
and outside of Hillsborough County at
 
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
the request of Hillsborough County
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
nursing home but do note that other
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities have shared
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
similar concerns regarding these the
 
01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
needs for such legislation
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
SB 149 is an effort to help address some
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the skyrocketing costs that we have
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
been made aware of intestimally before
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
the county executive body regarding
 
01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
traveling nursing agencies departments
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
other than the nursing home are also
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
experiencing skyrocketing increases in
 
01:44:01.129 --> 01:44:01.139 align:start position:0%
the cost of care when it comes to
 
01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
traveling placements
 
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
when presented to us the cost of
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
traveling agencies are nearly double or
 
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh or more than the cost of those who
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
are employed directly within the county
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
even with benefits or other roll-up
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
costs associated they are still higher
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
care facilities across New Hampshire are
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
emerging money to keep up with the
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing costs associated with some
 
01:44:25.609 --> 01:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
of these entities in addition to cost
 
01:44:27.649 --> 01:44:27.659 align:start position:0%
the delicate dance this puts on
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
negotiating Staffing schedules also
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
plays a role in how administrators
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
navigate care Staffing it is true that
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
most travel care will stay weeks or
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
months at a time but that said when
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
Staffing changes out it's still an
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
interruption to the care modules
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
you will hear from other folks later who
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
will talk about the intricacies of what
 
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
is before you Hillsborough County uh
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
nursing home alone has well over 100
 
01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
person wait list for beds and due to the
 
01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
Staffing shortages and increased costs
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
and care to fill the gaps over 50 beds
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
remain vacant inside the facility due to
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal constraints and Staffing
 
01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:03.109 align:start position:0%
fiscal constraints and Staffing
shortages

01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
shortages
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
this backlog alone creates a domino
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
effect to our larger Hospital networks
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
when folks are being discharged to more
 
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
acute from more acute hospital care into
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
other areas like nursing homes
 
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
this bill will require traveling
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
agencies to register register with the
 
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure uh and
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
certification as they are not required
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
to do so right now and also addresses an
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
agency contracts and Hospital facilities
 
01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
ensuring that nursing agencies are not
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
double booking care providers during the
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
same shifts or hours at two or more
 
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
different facilities at the same time
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
period of shift and it importantly
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
ensures that no agency is able to place
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
an individual Whose license has been
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
suspended into a care module in New
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Healthcare facilities
 
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
as the vice chair of the Hillsborough
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
County delegation sb149 offers Clarity
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
and consistency between providers and
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
Facilities whose care is delicately
 
01:45:57.770 --> 01:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
balanced between them this bill makes a
 
01:45:59.689 --> 01:45:59.699 align:start position:0%
commitment to ensure that there is Fair
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
competition fees and registered
 
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
providers are operating within New
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that our care facilities
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
can continue to utilize a variety of
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
service providers necessary during
 
01:46:10.609 --> 01:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
challenging times
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative has a question
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
if you can answer it yes um thank you I
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
will do my best and if not I'll defer to
 
01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:20.219 align:start position:0%
somebody else at a later time all right
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:21.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
so it's not clear to me how this is
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
going to help with reducing costs now I
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't I don't get that at all so if you
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
could help me with that
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh sure I can speak to some of what uh
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
we have heard before us in Hillsborough
 
01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.310 align:start position:0%
we have heard before us in Hillsborough
County

01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
County
 
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes there uh seems to be a
 
01:46:39.649 --> 01:46:39.659 align:start position:0%
competition happening between uh double
 
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
booking where an agency will commit a
 
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
per person or Personnel to one entity
 
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
only to then find it um being rescinded
 
01:46:49.729 --> 01:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
and going to somebody else at a
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart
 
01:46:57.290 --> 01:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so looking in
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
section well second page
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
Lines line eight whereas to compel that
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
facility to bid again for services
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
already promised
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
so you sign a contract with these
 
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
nursing the nursing agencies right
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
to provide a service to the the facility
 
01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
and now they're rescinding they're
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
renegging on the contract is that
 
01:47:18.659 --> 01:47:19.669 align:start position:0%
renegging on the contract is that
correct

01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
I think somebody behind me might be able
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
to speak to the specifics of those
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
because I am not in that position okay
 
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious just follow follow up
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious as to the the penalties
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
for breaching contract this seems like a
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
contract issue and it could be handled
 
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
that way but anyway the follow-up
 
01:47:36.649 --> 01:47:36.659 align:start position:0%
another question Madam a different
 
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
question different question yes so the
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
second part on line 10 is a nurse agency
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
shall not recruit potential employees on
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
the premises of a health care facility
 
01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
that just seems kind of like a free
 
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
speech issue I don't know how you could
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
stop somebody from saying hey you want a
 
01:47:52.129 --> 01:47:52.139 align:start position:0%
job I mean that just seems like a very
 
01:47:52.139 --> 01:47:53.570 align:start position:0%
job I mean that just seems like a very
Broad

01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
Broad
 
01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:55.669 align:start position:0%
Broad
issue

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
I will say that I think non-compete
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
clauses are
 
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
standard in other places
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes but this doesn't say that they'll
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
have a non-compete Clause that says that
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
they will not recruit which it strikes
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
me as being totally unenforceable
 
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
you'll have to ask some folks who may be
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
more aware of some of thank you okay we
 
01:48:21.169 --> 01:48:21.179 align:start position:0%
will do that other questions
 
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
good morning Matt good morning Madam

specialty hospitals we are in support of
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 149 and as stated by the
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor it would establish a process
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
for nurse staffing agencies to be
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
registered with the state which would
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
provide more transparency to all
 
01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
entities that utilize their services I
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
will not go over the attachment but I
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
really wanted to just leave this with
 
01:49:27.890 --> 01:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
you this summer last summer I should say
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
we did a labor cost study of our members
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
and so this is a one-page just
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
highlights of the study and then a more
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
complete study that I welcome you to to
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
review at your at your convenience
 
01:49:47.209 --> 01:49:47.219 align:start position:0%
it is one it shows that um this outlines
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
one of our major challenges facing
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals today is Workforce and while
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
the pandemic exacerbated this challenge
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
um the shortage has increased um with
 
01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
patient demand and hospitals had to
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
bring in temporary staff to care for the
 
01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
growing number of patients who present
 
01:50:09.410 --> 01:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
with serious illness and in need of
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
acute Hospital level care but
 
01:50:13.729 --> 01:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
unfortunately these challenges have just
 
01:50:16.010 --> 01:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
spiked um in the past several months and
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
is not likely to diminish so what
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
happens and I'll kind of skip through my
 
01:50:21.649 --> 01:50:21.659 align:start position:0%
testimony you could read that at your
 
01:50:25.129 --> 01:50:25.139 align:start position:0%
leisure but what happens is we now have
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
this astronomical increase in because of
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
personnel shortages increasing in
 
01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
contract labor that is highlighted in
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the report that I um I have shared with
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
you so This truly does threaten the
 
01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
financial viability of our hospitals
 
01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
because it is such a astronomical
 
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
increase as you can see by the um the
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
one pager that hospitals have seen at uh
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
133 percent increase in contracted labor
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
costs not just labor cost contracted
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
labor costs they've always had to
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
contract as you can see from prior years
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
but now
 
01:51:04.970 --> 01:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
they had to go out and utilize staffing
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
agencies and not just for nurses either
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify we have and the
 
01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
report does outline all the clinical
 
01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
Personnel that they need to contract and
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
non-clinical actually so we do um on
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
behalf of our hospitals I do strongly
 
01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
urge you to support this bill and I will
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions you may have
 
01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions that would
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for representative leckis
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you again um I don't see how this
 
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
is going to save money
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
um you maybe you can explain it but I
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
would think if anything
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
it could raise costs because you might
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
have some of the agencies that would
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
choose not to bother registering and not
 
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
doing business in New Hampshire since
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's demand everywhere and with fewer
 
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
options uh that might even raise costs
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand how this is going
 
01:51:53.689 --> 01:51:53.699 align:start position:0%
to help
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
um it's just honestly as I stated a very
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
modest attempt to at least have them
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
register because we um they're not even
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
registered in the state at this time so
 
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
the original bill was different than the
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
bill that has been amended and we worked
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
and agreed with
 
01:52:14.330 --> 01:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
um all the stakeholders to amend this
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill this is just again a modest
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
attempt to try to at least have them
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
register and then as was stated
 
01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:25.129 align:start position:0%
register and then as was stated
um

01:52:25.129 --> 01:52:25.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I think either you or another
 
01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:29.699 align:start position:0%
individual asked on page two
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
um starting on line five contracts
 
01:52:34.729 --> 01:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
between the agencies and the health care
 
01:52:34.739 --> 01:52:36.470 align:start position:0%
between the agencies and the health care
facilities

01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
um shell and then it goes on to say what
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
it shall not um include because some of
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
these issues have been raised in the
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
past again the as far as the hospitals
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
they have no choice patients need to be
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
cared for and they must
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
fill those nursing and clinical
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies so they have no choice so this
 
01:53:03.169 --> 01:53:03.179 align:start position:0%
is again quite a modest approach I know
 
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
that there are others here that can talk
 
01:53:08.209 --> 01:53:08.219 align:start position:0%
about what has passed in other states
 
01:53:11.209 --> 01:53:11.219 align:start position:0%
that is more significant this is this is
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
certainly has nothing to do with having
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
them identify their costs Etc
 
01:53:20.689 --> 01:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
um again it's it's just we believe in a
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
positive first step
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up yeah I understand
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
you believe that but I you know other
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
than there's some
 
01:53:31.370 --> 01:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
issues on the Contracting and again as
 
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
someone else mentioned I'm wondering if
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
that could be handled just how you
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
handle the contracts with the agencies
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
but I I truly don't see
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
other than maybe that issue which I
 
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
think could be handled another way how
 
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
this is going to help and it may very
 
01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
likely hurt
 
01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
if you can you know it's very
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
specifically how exactly is this going
 
01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
to reduce costs the rest of it I get
 
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:00.189 --> 01:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
again it is a an attempt to at least
 
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
disclose some information
 
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and to address our concerns relative
 
01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:06.890 align:start position:0%
um and to address our concerns relative
to

01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
um not having a lot of information and
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
again as outlined on page two it tries
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
to articulate what um has been a problem
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
so it may not reduce costs but it's I do
 
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
not believe it will re increase costs
 
01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
and hence why we support this Bill thank
 
01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:25.490 align:start position:0%
and hence why we support this Bill thank
you

01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gerhart thank
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
just in your opinion how would you
 
01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:34.609 align:start position:0%
just in your opinion how would you
prevent

01:54:34.609 --> 01:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
nurse agencies from recruiting on
 
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hospital grounds how do you see that
 
01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:39.649 align:start position:0%
Hospital grounds how do you see that
happening

01:54:39.649 --> 01:54:39.659 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
um so the hospital some hospitals
 
01:54:44.209 --> 01:54:44.219 align:start position:0%
actually have a policy um to that that
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
is not allowed when they contract with
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
an agency but I mean that I think
 
01:54:52.609 --> 01:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire's probably why
 
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
as far as whether or not that can be
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
enforced it is just again trying to hone
 
01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
in and and I guess rein in some of the
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
concerns and and problems that we have
 
01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.090 align:start position:0%
concerns and and problems that we have
identified

01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
um with with because
 
01:55:10.129 --> 01:55:10.139 align:start position:0%
we have to increa we have increased so
 
01:55:13.609 --> 01:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
dramatically the contracts um but at the
 
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
um they the con the contract shall not
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
they will state that they shall not
 
01:55:22.729 --> 01:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
recruit but if someone were to inquire
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
certainly that's that's possible the
 
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
hospitals some of the policies is
 
01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.330 align:start position:0%
hospitals some of the policies is
um

01:55:29.330 --> 01:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:31.689 --> 01:55:31.699 align:start position:0%
um articulate that if you are a current
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
nurse for instance and you um you cannot
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
leave the institution work for the
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
staffing agency then come back as a um
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
as a contracted nurse potentially at
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
that institution but it certainly could
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
go somewhere else but that has again
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
that is exacerbating our problem
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up on it yes please
 
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair so what
 
01:55:57.169 --> 01:55:57.179 align:start position:0%
would be very broadly what is the due
 
01:55:57.179 --> 01:55:58.330 align:start position:0%
would be very broadly what is the due
process

01:55:58.330 --> 01:55:58.340 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
policy procedure for determining if that
 
01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
was the current would that all be within
 
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
the hospitals call they have a little
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
secret room and they say you were in
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
violation of this policy or how does
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
that play out well if I I don't know if
 
01:56:11.209 --> 01:56:11.219 align:start position:0%
it's a secret room
 
01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
um but it's a um it's a Hospital's
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
policy and if you're an employee um just
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
like any employer you should follow the
 
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
employees the employers policies when
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
you are um hired by them all right thank
 
01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
you sure representative
 
01:56:32.450 --> 01:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
so it was um mentioned in the previous
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and I see it in this Con in
 
01:56:40.990 --> 01:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
this uh on page two in line six to nine
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
so it's possible that in that a travel
 
01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
agency will book
 
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
let's say nurse Jane
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
at two hospitals
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
and whichever Hospital pays the most
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
they will send nurse Jane there and they
 
01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
will cancel their contract with the
 
01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
other hospital is that and that could be
 
01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
basically you're sending the person to
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
the highest bidder
 
01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
is that what is that possibly what
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're trying to prevent
 
01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:15.350 align:start position:0%
they're trying to prevent
um

01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
representative Grote um I there are
 
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
others here that actually
 
01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:21.050 align:start position:0%
others here that actually
um

01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
sign these contracts and uh run
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
institutions so I I think they would be
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
best to answer the question because they
 
01:57:33.370 --> 01:57:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
question of the chair is this going to a
 
01:57:38.159 --> 01:57:40.490 align:start position:0%
question of the chair is this going to a
subcommittee

01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
um at the moment it sure looks like it
 
01:57:46.970 --> 01:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
looks like an Enlightenment from one of
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
the half dozen people that haven't
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.530 --> 01:57:53.540 align:start position:0%
you're forewarned
 
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
yes we will we will be seeking
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
Enlightenment other questions comments
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
01:58:19.689 --> 01:58:19.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable chair members of
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is David Ross for
 
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
the record I am the administrator of
 
01:58:28.010 --> 01:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County Nursing Home in
 
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
Goffstown and I have been a licensed
 
01:58:32.089 --> 01:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator for over 30
 
01:58:32.099 --> 01:58:33.410 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator for over 30
years

01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
I respectfully request your support of
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 149.
 
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
temporary staffing agencies have long
 
01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
been a support for health care
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
facilities and all through my career and
 
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
they serve a very specific purpose to
 
01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
help health care organizations support
 
01:58:50.810 --> 01:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
safe and appropriate care while we're
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
working through temporary Workforce
 
01:58:52.199 --> 01:58:53.450 align:start position:0%
working through temporary Workforce
challenges

01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
this bill provides operational standards
 
01:58:58.129 --> 01:58:58.139 align:start position:0%
by which temporary nurse staff agencies
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
supporting facilities must abide
 
01:59:02.810 --> 01:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
the bill initially was focused on
 
01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:04.189 align:start position:0%
the bill initially was focused on
transparency

01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
requiring disclosure of cost paid to
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
agency workers and comparison with the
 
01:59:10.129 --> 01:59:10.139 align:start position:0%
charges built to Health Care Facilities
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
but we've amicably paired this down to
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
Brass tax establishing standards for
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
nursing agencies operating in New
 
01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.390 align:start position:0%
nursing agencies operating in New
Hampshire

01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:59:19.129 --> 01:59:19.139 align:start position:0%
the bill no longer requires the
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
licensing of the staffing agencies but
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
does require registration with the oplc
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
it no longer requires that they disclose
 
01:59:28.250 --> 01:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
costs versus charges because that was
 
01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
felt to be proprietary information I
 
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
will note that all Medicare and Medicaid
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
license facilities do have to disclose
 
01:59:37.729 --> 01:59:37.739 align:start position:0%
their own costs through in revenues
 
01:59:39.169 --> 01:59:39.179 align:start position:0%
annually through a cost reporting
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
process however
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
this bill does require that agencies not
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
leverage their Staffing crisis by taking
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
personal advantages or booking an
 
01:59:50.330 --> 01:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
individual at two facilities
 
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and then bidding up their price so to
 
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
be able to send them to the highest
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
bidder and it prohibits them from
 
01:59:57.119 --> 01:59:57.830 align:start position:0%
bidder and it prohibits them from
um

01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:59.570 --> 01:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
recruiting staff at the facilities and
 
02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to discuss that with you
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're tired of hearing of the
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
workforce crisis we all are no one more
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
so in healthcare
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
but what is more tiring is the
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
unfettered imbalance that the healthcare
 
02:00:14.209 --> 02:00:14.219 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies have with being able
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
to charge pricing
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
that is disregard to any reimbursement
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
methodology they're taking advantage of
 
02:00:24.649 --> 02:00:24.659 align:start position:0%
the law of supply and demand and it's
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
really putting us in a crisis because we
 
02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
have to balance patient care needs
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
this bill does not
 
02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:32.030 align:start position:0%
this bill does not
um

02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
intend to control costs I do not believe
 
02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
that this bill will reduce costs what
 
02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
this bill will do is to put some
 
02:00:41.810 --> 02:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
measures in place to establish some
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
operating standards initially for health
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
care agencies that are working in New
 
02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:48.350 align:start position:0%
care agencies that are working in New
Hampshire

02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
there are so many facets here that we
 
02:00:52.850 --> 02:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
have to work on as a state to be able to
 
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
address the workforce crisis
 
02:00:57.530 --> 02:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
this bill is just one step of many to be
 
02:00:59.689 --> 02:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
able to help us move along that way I'm
 
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:02.810 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
have

02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
ah thank you so you you uh
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
do you contradict the sponsor to the
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
saying that it's now not now intended to
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
reduce costs just establish how the this
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
will these agencies will operate in the
 
02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:21.659 align:start position:0%
state I don't uh intend to contradict
 
02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
the sponsor but I do not believe that it
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
will really have any measure to control
 
02:01:28.729 --> 02:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
costs the initial bill as presented
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
really was a measure to help us to
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
identify costs with the objective to be
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
able to help control costs
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
um and we have
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
um agreed to be able to change some
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
Provisions in that because there was a
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
lot of objection to that and at this
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
point we think that it's just more
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us and necessary for us
 
02:01:48.169 --> 02:01:48.179 align:start position:0%
to establish some standards of practice
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
for the agencies that are operating in
 
02:01:52.490 --> 02:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire all right thank you if you
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
could explain to me how
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the non-recruitment Clause is
 
02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:01.430 align:start position:0%
um the non-recruitment Clause is
enforceable

02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
um that if it so in all of our contracts
 
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
then and as a as a healthcare agency
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
provider that they would in order to be
 
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
registered in the state they would be
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited from that which would require
 
02:02:14.089 --> 02:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
them to obligate their employees to do
 
02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
um if an employee is of an agency is
 
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
recruiting at a facility then that would
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
end their service within the
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
organization and jeopardize their
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
employment I'm assuming within the
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
agency in order for them to maintain
 
02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
agency in order for them to maintain
registration

02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
registration
 
02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
02:02:31.739 --> 02:02:33.950 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
Schmidt

02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
02:02:37.129 --> 02:02:37.139 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh I'm the
 
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
chair of the Stratford County nursing
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
home and I'm wondering at the nursing
 
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
home this Trafford County delegation but
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about our nursing home and
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering uh are you all conferring
 
02:02:51.410 --> 02:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
with one another the administrators to
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
try to to deal with the situation aside
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
from legislation very much so very much
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
so and we are all in support of this
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislation I am here on behalf of the
 
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of counties
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking in support of the nursing
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
home Affiliates so which does comprise
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
of all of the nursing homes within the
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
County's delegation
 
02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
do you find that
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
in this competing Workforce
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
situation that you're competing with
 
02:03:27.410 --> 02:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
other nursing
 
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
home facilities or hospitals or anyone
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
or any health care facility
 
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
in this Workforce I am yes the short
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
answer is yes but I'm also competing
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
with every other industry that exists we
 
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
are losing a cook right now to
 
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
um to another entity um to go work for
 
02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.010 align:start position:0%
um to another entity um to go work for
Amazon

02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
Amazon
 
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
um every entity we are in compete in
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
competition with yeah
 
02:04:00.169 --> 02:04:00.179 align:start position:0%
follow-up I I can understand that so
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
let's just talk about
 
02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
the traveling nurse yeah so if the
 
02:04:06.129 --> 02:04:06.139 align:start position:0%
traveling nurse
 
02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
chooses let's go back to the example
 
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
nurse Jane
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
it has a job as a has a possibilities
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
booked to work at the Hillsborough
 
02:04:16.609 --> 02:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility
 
02:04:18.770 --> 02:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
but then
 
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
you lose that person to another Health
 
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
Care Facility what is that Health Care
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
Facility typically is it a private
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facility is it another
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
County facility do you can you can you I
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
would not know oh okay oh you would not
 
02:04:37.070 --> 02:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
know I would not know which facility
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
that they are booked at
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
um we work with two types of agency
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
personnel there are individuals that we
 
02:04:49.129 --> 02:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
consider to be travel nurses that are
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
booked for an 8 or 13 week schedule with
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
us say 40 hours a week
 
02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
um and then there are per diem staff
 
02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
that we contract with that are for as
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
needed shifts
 
02:05:03.890 --> 02:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
so we could book somebody for a shift
 
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow evening three to eleven and
 
02:05:08.930 --> 02:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
then get a call that they're going to be
 
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
canceling that shift and we find out
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
from the individual that they're being
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
transferred to another facility that's
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
paying them more
 
02:05:16.199 --> 02:05:17.930 align:start position:0%
paying them more
so

02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
um in some cases other facilities
 
02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
depending on the system that they have
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
to book their shifts in
 
02:05:26.510 --> 02:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
um they will get a notice that there's
 
02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:28.679 align:start position:0%
now an up charge for them to keep that
 
02:05:31.129 --> 02:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
shift in which case if they want to be
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
able to keep the shift they've got to
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
pay more to be able to keep that or they
 
02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
have to release the shift
 
02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
um and another facility will take it
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
hmm yes representative sure thank you
 
02:05:43.729 --> 02:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
02:05:43.739 --> 02:05:45.290 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
question

02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:05:47.089 --> 02:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
um in the instance that you mentioned
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
where you have booked someone to come
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
and then they renege on that and go
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
elsewhere uh is the alternative that you
 
02:06:00.649 --> 02:06:00.659 align:start position:0%
then have would be to likely force one
 
02:06:02.330 --> 02:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
of your current employees to work
 
02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
overtime which would in fact increase
 
02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.770 align:start position:0%
overtime which would in fact increase
costs

02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
those are our only recourses is because
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
we have to maintain safety and
 
02:06:17.450 --> 02:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
we are already doing that in advance of
 
02:06:19.370 --> 02:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
booking agency
 
02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
for my facility we have over 90
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
positions that are open in our nursing
 
02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
department we are currently contracted
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
with 28 individuals from an agency seven
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
nurses and 21 lnas that only keeps us
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
safe while we're keeping 50 beds open
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
our costs this year you know last year
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
we spent three hundred thousand dollars
 
02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
on agency in a year now we're spending
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
that in a month and we are projected to
 
02:06:50.089 --> 02:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
be close to three million dollars in
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
agency costs this year
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
um practices such as up charging
 
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
because there may be a covid case in the
 
02:06:58.500 --> 02:06:59.530 align:start position:0%
because there may be a covid case in the
facility

02:06:59.530 --> 02:06:59.540 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:07:02.089 --> 02:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
up charging because they can enter into
 
02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
a bidding war those are practices that
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
should not be permitted because
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
ultimately all of these costs end up
 
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
coming back through the tax base to
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
County taxpayers the county is
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
responsible for the non-federal share of
 
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid costs
 
02:07:22.669 --> 02:07:22.679 align:start position:0%
so as these costs elevate
 
02:07:24.290 --> 02:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable to anticipate that
 
02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
the burden to the taxpayers is going to
 
02:07:29.159 --> 02:07:29.750 align:start position:0%
the burden to the taxpayers is going to
grow

02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
grow
 
02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:30.229 align:start position:0%
grow
[Music]

02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:30.239 --> 02:07:32.089 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:07:32.089 --> 02:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:34.070 --> 02:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
yes indeed any other questions
 
02:07:36.290 --> 02:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart thank you madam
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
chair I had to step out so if I missed
 
02:07:40.729 --> 02:07:40.739 align:start position:0%
this answer then forgive me but these
 
02:07:42.770 --> 02:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
contracts seem like they're terribly
 
02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
written is there's nothing to keep
 
02:07:46.370 --> 02:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
there's nothing you can write into the
 
02:07:48.109 --> 02:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
contract to keep these
 
02:07:50.089 --> 02:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
instances of
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
price gouging from occurring I mean it's
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
something to say if you said you're
 
02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
going to be here at this time you have
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
to be here at this time or you're going
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
to be penalized X
 
02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.970 align:start position:0%
to be penalized X
correct

02:07:58.970 --> 02:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
um there's two types of individuals I'm
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
not sure if you were here for that part
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
of the conversation you did hear that
 
02:08:05.570 --> 02:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
um so it depends on the type of person
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
that we're that we're scheduling if we
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
have someone who's committed to a 40
 
02:08:10.850 --> 02:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
hour a week schedule they're they're a
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
travel nurse that are working
 
02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
um again you know 8 or 13 weeks we don't
 
02:08:17.209 --> 02:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
see that with them
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
um where all of a sudden they're booked
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
Monday through Friday and then on
 
02:08:21.530 --> 02:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
Thursday they're being canceled to
 
02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
upcharge to another facility that
 
02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen in those contracts when
 
02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
you're with a per diem contract
 
02:08:30.290 --> 02:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
um for a day-to-day schedule that's when
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
you would see that happen when you're
 
02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
going in to book somebody and suddenly
 
02:08:36.649 --> 02:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
that shift is being canceled
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
our alternate our alternative is to not
 
02:08:42.169 --> 02:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
use them and
 
02:08:43.729 --> 02:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
um in which case we have to further
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
reduce our occupancy because we can't
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
care for patients that we have in the
 
02:08:52.609 --> 02:08:52.619 align:start position:0%
building so we are really at
 
02:08:55.370 --> 02:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
the end of the road as far as how much
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
further can we reduce occupancy
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and be at the mercy of of practices
 
02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
so this bill really attempts to deal
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
with some of those poor practices
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
um from from the agencies and hold them
 
02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
to a very basic standard of performance
 
02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
without addressing cost controls on
 
02:09:15.169 --> 02:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
their part all right thank you
 
02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative blackis thank you this is
 
02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
actually a question I just thought of
 
02:09:20.810 --> 02:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if you're if you can
 
02:09:23.209 --> 02:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
answer it but if you can
 
02:09:26.290 --> 02:09:26.300 align:start position:0%
um so this would be
 
02:09:28.609 --> 02:09:28.619 align:start position:0%
registration for any nursing agency
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
whether they contract
 
02:09:34.129 --> 02:09:34.139 align:start position:0%
with uh government customers or if they
 
02:09:36.649 --> 02:09:36.659 align:start position:0%
exclusively contract with the private is
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:43.490 align:start position:0%
 
true

02:09:43.490 --> 02:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
true
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:09:46.850 --> 02:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:09:48.410 --> 02:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I think all accounting nursing homes
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
have problems funding you know with the
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
with the nursing agencies
 
02:09:56.209 --> 02:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
what I don't understand why do those
 
02:10:01.609 --> 02:10:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
is it that uh the nurses or lnas that
 
02:10:08.209 --> 02:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
they're sending only want to work for a
 
02:10:10.250 --> 02:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
few weeks I mean why aren't they going
 
02:10:13.010 --> 02:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
to your facility full time
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of reasons for that
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
um someone working for an agency gets to
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
dictate their own schedule they can
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
determine that they want to work say
 
02:10:24.649 --> 02:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
just Monday through Friday or they only
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
want to work Tuesday and Thursday
 
02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
when we have structures that support
 
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
um you know a continuity of care we do
 
02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
have per diem employees that can work
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
for us with flexibility so we've create
 
02:10:40.729 --> 02:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
we've adapted and we've created some of
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
that flexibility
 
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
but what they are not limited to is how
 
02:10:46.609 --> 02:10:46.619 align:start position:0%
much that they can charge
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
we are based on our reimbursement
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
structure so the agencies have the
 
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
ability to offer higher pay
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and then come to us and say it's
 
02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
going to cost you
 
02:11:01.609 --> 02:11:01.619 align:start position:0%
150 an hour for this nurse to come to
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
your facility whereas my cell phone
 
02:11:05.209 --> 02:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
might be able to pay a nurse thirty
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour
 
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a choice if I if I have
 
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
no nurse and I have no one else who can
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
work another shift of overtime because
 
02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
I've already worked 16 hours in a day
 
02:11:18.890 --> 02:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
then my option to continue to provide
 
02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
care to those patients is to book an
 
02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
agency person
 
02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
I have nurses that work for us full time
 
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
that also work for agencies on the side
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
and they say I won't pick up a shift
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
unless I'm getting at least fifty
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour and the bidding will
 
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
start they'll get calls from their
 
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
agency saying we get a shift they'll
 
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
give you thirty dollars an hour to say I
 
02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
told you not to call me until it's 50.
 
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
and so and that's and that's how it
 
02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
works so that's why people go is because
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
it's available
 
02:11:55.729 --> 02:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
um and because they can earn money
 
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
um and I can't blame someone for for
 
02:12:00.050 --> 02:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
wanting to
 
02:12:03.410 --> 02:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
um earn more money but we are limited in
 
02:12:08.450 --> 02:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
a system that is paid for by taxpayers
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
right as to how much money we can afford
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
to pay in the system this can't go
 
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
unfettered what we're seeing with this
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
now is that all facilities are
 
02:12:20.209 --> 02:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
decreasing occupancy
 
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
because they there's not enough
 
02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
Personnel to do this to do this Care on
 
02:12:26.930 --> 02:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
a continual basis
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
the average occupancy in New Hampshire
 
02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
and nursing facilities is now 79 percent
 
02:12:35.450 --> 02:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
and it used to be in the 90s
 
02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the backlog in all of the
 
02:12:40.070 --> 02:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals where they can't discharge
 
02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:41.450 align:start position:0%
hospitals where they can't discharge
patients

02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and the system is crumbling in upon
 
02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:46.510 align:start position:0%
um and the system is crumbling in upon
itself

02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
while we allow these agencies to
 
02:12:53.209 --> 02:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
continue to pay more money
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
um unchecked then we will continue to
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
see more and more employees that are
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
gainfully employed full-time leave that
 
02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
to know that they can go and work for
 
02:13:05.089 --> 02:13:05.099 align:start position:0%
these temporary agencies on the side and
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
the system will completely collapse
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't stop that and I want
 
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
to be clear about that
 
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
um we that we wouldn't be able to make
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
that happen this session
 
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is start to take a
 
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
look at some of the very basic practices
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
of those agencies to make sure that we
 
02:13:28.129 --> 02:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
start to move in the right direction
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you um I mean I I'm certainly
 
02:13:36.589 --> 02:13:36.599 align:start position:0%
aware of the financial problem and I
 
02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm in the Hillsborough County
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
delegation and I pay Hillsboro County
 
02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
property taxes so I have an interest in
 
02:13:44.089 --> 02:13:44.099 align:start position:0%
this but um
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like a solution that actually
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
works and I'm I on the one hand you say
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
you can't pay more than some amount
 
02:13:52.729 --> 02:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
because the reimbursement model on the
 
02:13:53.810 --> 02:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
other hand you're already paying more
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
because you're having a contract with
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
these agencies and I'm wondering if
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's something in the Middle where I
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
mean those agencies are taking a cut
 
02:14:07.129 --> 02:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
so unless you believe that the um I'm
 
02:14:08.990 --> 02:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering if I'm getting to a
 
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
question here but if unless you believe
 
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
02:14:15.229 --> 02:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
the supply of staff is going to increase
 
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
enough that this problem is going to go
 
02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
away and you're going to be able to hire
 
02:14:21.410 --> 02:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
enough people at the rate you want to
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
then I don't see this bill doing
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
anything of any significance to solve
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
the problem and I'm wondering if Instead
 
02:14:31.010 --> 02:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
at least for a while if you offered you
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
know and you're doing some but offer
 
02:14:34.129 --> 02:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
more money and more
 
02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the employees to attract
 
02:14:40.370 --> 02:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
more employees rather than hiring um uh
 
02:14:42.530 --> 02:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
agency and then and them taking a
 
02:14:44.569 --> 02:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
significant cut I mean have you
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
considered that or what are your
 
02:14:48.109 --> 02:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that we are doing that
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
um so with our per diem staff we do
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
offer a higher rate of pay more
 
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility less commitment less
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility for any benefits so we're
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do those things but we can't
 
02:15:03.169 --> 02:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
compete with the rates that the agencies
 
02:15:03.179 --> 02:15:04.910 align:start position:0%
compete with the rates that the agencies
provide

02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:05.930 align:start position:0%
provide
um

02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:08.209 --> 02:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
I would only say that there's no one
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
simple answer to this but it's going to
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
take a lot of small steps to be able to
 
02:15:17.290 --> 02:15:17.300 align:start position:0%
help get to the right answer
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is one of those steps
 
02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
all right thank you you're welcome
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%

shortage

02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh versus fitzpat I think that's a tad
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of this particular bill
 
02:16:06.290 --> 02:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
I understand matters thank you okay
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:09.649 --> 02:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
Brooks under Bailey
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
you referred earlier to this law of
 
02:16:16.370 --> 02:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
supply and demand or
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's a attempt to sort
 
02:16:21.709 --> 02:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
of cap wages and wouldn't that cause
 
02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
shortages of nurses
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
um this is not an attempt to cap wages
 
02:16:29.089 --> 02:16:29.099 align:start position:0%
yeah um I want to be clear about that
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
um some states have kept wages for for
 
02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
Outside Agency Personnel
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
um and they're still have many of them
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:40.009 align:start position:0%
all the time
um

02:16:40.009 --> 02:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:43.129 --> 02:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
so so I guess if that answers your
 
02:16:48.889 --> 02:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:50.509 --> 02:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a quick
 
02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
question can you tell me
 
02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:54.830 align:start position:0%
question can you tell me
what

02:16:54.830 --> 02:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
happens to Morale on the staff when you
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
have someone that's making 28 an hour
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
and you have to go out and hire someone
 
02:17:03.770 --> 02:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
to come in to do the same job and
 
02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
they're getting paid 60 an hour
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think you know the answer to that
 
02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
right is it was morale deteriorates
 
02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:12.650 align:start position:0%
right is it was morale deteriorates
immensely

02:17:12.650 --> 02:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
immensely
 
02:17:13.969 --> 02:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:17:16.330 --> 02:17:16.340 align:start position:0%
um that also addresses the issue of
 
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
recruitment when that agency person is
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
out telling everyone how much they make
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
um that's that's a big incentive it is
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
extremely demoralizing and very
 
02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:30.260 align:start position:0%
frustrating for our staff to be working
 
02:17:33.290 --> 02:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
16 hours a day aside someone who's
 
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
coming in with really no accountability
 
02:17:39.410 --> 02:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
and making so much more it's it's very
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
frustrating but this bill doesn't
 
02:17:42.830 --> 02:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
address that
 
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
02:17:47.690 --> 02:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you all very
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
oh you have to turn it on
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and honorable
 
02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
record Brendan Williams I'm the
 
02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Association we represent a
 
02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities including most
 
02:18:35.089 --> 02:18:35.099 align:start position:0%
of the state's nursing homes many
 
02:18:37.610 --> 02:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities Continuing
 
02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
Care retirement communities and also the
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
Cedar Crest Center for children with
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
disabilities all of these settings are
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
in support of Senate bill 149.
 
02:18:51.049 --> 02:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
this is really a transparency and best
 
02:18:53.209 --> 02:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
practices Bill I've I've heard some
 
02:18:55.849 --> 02:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
discussion here obviously as to whether
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
or not it could save costs there are
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
other states that have gone further just
 
02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
last year for example Republican
 
02:19:07.089 --> 02:19:07.099 align:start position:0%
legislatures in Iowa and Missouri
 
02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
require that agencies disclose all of
 
02:19:14.209 --> 02:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
their costs to the state what they are
 
02:19:16.490 --> 02:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
charging facilities and what they are in
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
turn paying their workers this is not
 
02:19:22.129 --> 02:19:22.139 align:start position:0%
that bill we are not proposing that that
 
02:19:22.139 --> 02:19:23.929 align:start position:0%
that bill we are not proposing that that
occur

02:19:23.929 --> 02:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
occur
 
02:19:27.049 --> 02:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
there were a number of other states that
 
02:19:29.810 --> 02:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
passed registration acts pertaining to
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies last year this does
 
02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
not Place us outside of the norm I think
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
that any idea that this is somehow going
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
to discourage Agency use here in New
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you need not be concerned
 
02:19:47.209 --> 02:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
about that agencies are not going to
 
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
stop doing business here just as they
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
have not stopped doing business in the
 
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
neighboring state of Massachusetts which
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
actually has a cap on what those
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
agencies can charge agencies are beaten
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
down the door to do business in the
 
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts so but it does um
 
02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
provide for some transparency we at
 
02:20:11.450 --> 02:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
least would understand how many of these
 
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
agencies are doing business here in the
 
02:20:16.010 --> 02:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire through
 
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
registration and registration is not an
 
02:20:21.290 --> 02:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
onerous thing this is a bill that has
 
02:20:22.610 --> 02:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
been agreed to with the American
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
Staffing Association I've talked to a
 
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
local staffing agency owner who
 
02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
is in support of this legislation thinks
 
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable thinks that the
 
02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
practices that this bill would expressly
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
forbid are practices that no reputable
 
02:20:41.809 --> 02:20:41.819 align:start position:0%
agency would engage in but we are amidst
 
02:20:43.969 --> 02:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
a terrible Staffing crisis we have seen
 
02:20:46.730 --> 02:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
nationally a reduction in the nursing
 
02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
home Workforce of over uh 300 000
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
workers since the pandemic began and
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
that is uh really hitting here at home
 
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
and into the void have come staffing
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
agencies and there was a letter that
 
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
roughly 200 members of the U.S House
 
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
submitted to the Biden Administration
 
02:21:13.490 --> 02:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
asking for an FTC investigation into
 
02:21:16.849 --> 02:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
price gouging by staffing agencies that
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
letter was bipartisan it was signed by
 
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
Freedom caucus members including doctors
 
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
gosar and Dr Ronnie Jackson uh Elise
 
02:21:28.130 --> 02:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
stefanik the number four house
 
02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
Republican signed on to that letter and
 
02:21:33.170 --> 02:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh you know unfortunately there's been
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
no action that's occurred at the federal
 
02:21:37.250 --> 02:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
level and as a consequence we have seen
 
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
a number of these registration or
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
licensure bills in the states
 
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
and this bill is very much consistent
 
02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
from a fiduciary perspective obviously
 
02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
all of you are members of your county
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
delegations and County nursing homes are
 
02:21:55.969 --> 02:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
Contracting with staffing agencies and
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
we should want a little bit of
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
transparency associated with those
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
arrangements we should want a
 
02:22:05.210 --> 02:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
registration of those staffing agencies
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
the state itself entered into a 7.6
 
02:22:10.490 --> 02:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
million dollar contract with a
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
California staffing agency to staff the
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
veterans home
 
02:22:18.290 --> 02:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
they got a relative bargain rate for
 
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistance paying no
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
more than
 
02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
37.44 cents an hour for the services of
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
an l a
 
02:22:29.210 --> 02:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
I have a 22 member uh non-profit
 
02:22:30.889 --> 02:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
catholic-owned Nursing Home in
 
02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
Manchester only serves nuns and they pay
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
as much as 43 dollars an hour for the
 
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
services in L A and they're writing
 
02:22:43.130 --> 02:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
those checks to a Dallas Texas address
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
you know I heard it asked why one can
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
simply rely upon a breach of contract in
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
instances where there is double booking
 
02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
of a person and
 
02:22:57.469 --> 02:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
as an attorney I should want to see a
 
02:23:00.650 --> 02:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
lot of litigation but the consequence
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
short of registration short of some
 
02:23:07.490 --> 02:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
regulatory regime would be that you
 
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
would have to litigate all those cases
 
02:23:11.210 --> 02:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
you'd have to file a small claim pay a
 
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
90 filing fee serve it upon the other
 
02:23:18.050 --> 02:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
party uh 30-day notice uh serve it out
 
02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
of state for the most part because these
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
agencies are based out of state
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm reasonably sure that the Saint
 
02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:25.809 align:start position:0%
I'm reasonably sure that the Saint
Joseph

02:23:25.809 --> 02:23:25.819 align:start position:0%
Joseph
 
02:23:28.429 --> 02:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
residents in Manchester serving nuns
 
02:23:30.910 --> 02:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
does not have the wherewithal to
 
02:23:33.469 --> 02:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
serve parties out of state in Dallas
 
02:23:33.479 --> 02:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
serve parties out of state in Dallas
Texas

02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
Texas
 
02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:36.230 align:start position:0%
Texas
um

02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:39.650 --> 02:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
the Tennessee comptroller at the behest
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
of that State's a republican legislature
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
and Governor I did a study on the
 
02:23:47.690 --> 02:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
explosion of a staffing agency costs in
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and found that they'd gone
 
02:23:54.410 --> 02:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
from 9.1 million dollars in cost in 2019
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
to protect over 100 million dollars in
 
02:24:00.410 --> 02:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
20 2022
 
02:24:04.610 --> 02:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
in Sullivan County we have seen the cost
 
02:24:08.330 --> 02:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
of a nursing home Agency use go from 71
 
02:24:10.270 --> 02:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
cents per patient day
 
02:24:14.410 --> 02:24:14.420 align:start position:0%
in 2019 to over 14
 
02:24:18.590 --> 02:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
per patient day in 2021 that's a two
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
thousand percent increase
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
so again uh you know we wanted to reach
 
02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
further with this legislation uh but as
 
02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
we know uh the enemy of the good is the
 
02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
perfect uh legislative process is one of
 
02:24:35.450 --> 02:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
compromise uh we have compromised with
 
02:24:37.490 --> 02:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
the American Staffing Association this
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
is an agreed to Bill that's passed the
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
Senate and we encourage your support I'd
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:24:50.030 --> 02:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking that what this
 
02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
legislation does another word that
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
you're saying people have said
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
transparency what it does is it
 
02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
establishes a Baseline
 
02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
create a baseline of what's happening in
 
02:25:01.309 --> 02:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because we really don't
 
02:25:03.469 --> 02:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
have a way of doing that other than this
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
it does and you know I've heard some
 
02:25:08.270 --> 02:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
very good questions you know for example
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
somebody said boy these are really bad
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
contracts right well you know these are
 
02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
contracts of adhesion effectively I mean
 
02:25:17.929 --> 02:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
there's an imbalance of power here your
 
02:25:20.090 --> 02:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
provider you need the services of an
 
02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
agency you're not going to be able to
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
negotiate that boilerplate contract I've
 
02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
got to fill a Friday night shift in
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
order to be able to serve my residents
 
02:25:31.370 --> 02:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
or I'm going to get cited by the state
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh applying Federal survey standards
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
what am I going to do
 
02:25:37.969 --> 02:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take whatever contract I
 
02:25:40.370 --> 02:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
get and those are the circumstances that
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
facilities find themselves in
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
there was also a question about uh you
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
know the enforceability of
 
02:25:49.969 --> 02:25:49.979 align:start position:0%
non-recruitment on the premises uh
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know I've never gone into a Market
 
02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
Basket and seen an application table for
 
02:25:58.849 --> 02:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
work at Shaw's the First Amendment does
 
02:26:02.270 --> 02:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
not confer the right to do business on
 
02:26:04.610 --> 02:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
another business's premises and so I
 
02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
think this is entirely consistent with
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
what other states have done
 
02:26:11.809 --> 02:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that point other
 
02:26:11.819 --> 02:26:13.370 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that point other
questions

02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:26:14.809 --> 02:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
look we'll uh
 
02:26:39.050 --> 02:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:40.610 --> 02:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is Gary
 
02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:41.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is Gary
pahoon

02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
pahoon
 
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:42.710 align:start position:0%
pahoon
um

02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:44.330 --> 02:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing the New Hampshire
 
02:26:46.849 --> 02:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
Association of Residential Care Homes
 
02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
which is the Statewide Organization for
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
residential care and assisted living
 
02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:52.910 align:start position:0%
residential care and assisted living
homes

02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I shouldn't say the as Brendan said
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
here also represents some assisted
 
02:27:00.050 --> 02:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
living homes but we represent more
 
02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:02.570 align:start position:0%
living homes but we represent more
um

02:27:02.570 --> 02:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:05.210 --> 02:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
what I have handed out is a letter
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
written by Sarah NATO
 
02:27:10.010 --> 02:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
who is the owner administrator of
 
02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:12.620 align:start position:0%
Carriage Hill in Madbury
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
and I hand this out because I think it
 
02:27:18.290 --> 02:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
gives some insight on the perspective of
 
02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
the plight of these smaller organization
 
02:27:23.929 --> 02:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
or the small smaller home in this crisis
 
02:27:26.450 --> 02:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
which is only exacerbated by the
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies Sarah had hoped to be
 
02:27:31.849 --> 02:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
here today herself to address you but
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
she was unable to come so she asked me
 
02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
to come in her Stead
 
02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:35.809 align:start position:0%
to come in her Stead
[Music]

02:27:35.809 --> 02:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:27:35.819 --> 02:27:36.710 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at the letter you'll see
 
02:27:41.330 --> 02:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
that many of the things that are in the
 
02:27:43.309 --> 02:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
bill that are addressed as abuses in the
 
02:27:46.849 --> 02:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
bill have happened to her and to her
 
02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
residents at Carriage Hill
 
02:27:53.469 --> 02:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
um she has paid 20 to 40 dollars an hour
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
surcharge for covet outbreaks
 
02:27:59.330 --> 02:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
um recently within the last three weeks
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
she has been charged a four dollar per
 
02:28:05.809 --> 02:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
hour service charge for late booking or
 
02:28:08.570 --> 02:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
last minute booking uh which is defined
 
02:28:11.389 --> 02:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
as any booking less than 12 hours before
 
02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
the shift
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
neither of these are in neither of these
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
surcharges or in her contract
 
02:28:21.410 --> 02:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
um as Brendan pointed out these are
 
02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
adherence contracts these aren't
 
02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
negotiated contracts
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
the contract is presented to you and you
 
02:28:30.650 --> 02:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
sign it or not if you don't sign it you
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
don't get the services if you do sign it
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
you're pretty much Bound by it
 
02:28:36.650 --> 02:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
when they break even their adherence
 
02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
contract your only recourse really is to
 
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
sue them and as Sarah will point out in
 
02:28:43.969 --> 02:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
her letter she has neither the time nor
 
02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
the money attempting to run her 24-bed
 
02:28:49.309 --> 02:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
facility to take on any of the staffing
 
02:28:49.319 --> 02:28:50.750 align:start position:0%
facility to take on any of the staffing
agencies

02:28:50.750 --> 02:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:52.270 align:start position:0%
agencies
so

02:28:52.270 --> 02:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:55.730 --> 02:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
she has also lost to employees in the
 
02:28:58.490 --> 02:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
last year to recruitment from staffing
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
agencies and she's had to bid on several
 
02:29:01.439 --> 02:29:02.469 align:start position:0%
agencies and she's had to bid on several
occasions

02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
occasions
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
at the last minute for staff because
 
02:29:08.690 --> 02:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
she's she's con the way that works is
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
that she's contacted by the agency and
 
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
said okay we've committed an aid to you
 
02:29:15.889 --> 02:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
for the the 11 to 7 shift tonight
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
however there's another party who's
 
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:22.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:29:22.849 --> 02:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
the bonus is she understands in most
 
02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
instances does not go to the agency it
 
02:29:29.210 --> 02:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
goes to the
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
staff member who was sent okay and the
 
02:29:35.929 --> 02:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
the agency uses that incentive to retain
 
02:29:37.610 --> 02:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
and recruit staff so it's another
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
Advantage they have over uh over the the
 
02:29:44.030 --> 02:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
home that would normally employ them
 
02:29:47.210 --> 02:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
Sarah points out that in the last year
 
02:29:49.490 --> 02:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
she spent sixty thousand dollars over
 
02:29:52.429 --> 02:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
what she would normally have spent for
 
02:29:52.439 --> 02:29:54.469 align:start position:0%
what she would normally have spent for
staff

02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
um by using agencies in others that's
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
not sixty thousand dollars of the agency
 
02:30:00.889 --> 02:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
she's actually spent I guess eighty or
 
02:30:02.450 --> 02:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
ninety thousand dollars with agencies
 
02:30:04.610 --> 02:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
but that sixty thousand dollars more
 
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
than she would normally have spent if
 
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:11.809 --> 02:30:11.819 align:start position:0%
um Sarah's room home is relatively small
 
02:30:14.450 --> 02:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
over the last few days I've talked to a
 
02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
number member a number of our members
 
02:30:18.770 --> 02:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
who have used staffing agencies I talked
 
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
to a home in Nashua that is budgeted has
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
budgeted one million dollars for
 
02:30:26.570 --> 02:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies this year
 
02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
on average they are uh Hiring Agency
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
staff for two to three hundred hours per
 
02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:34.550 align:start position:0%
staff for two to three hundred hours per
week

02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
um again before the pandemic they
 
02:30:38.450 --> 02:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
occasionally used
 
02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies but only very
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
occasionally and in nothing like this
 
02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
one of the uh when I spoke to that
 
02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
particular administrator one of her
 
02:30:48.420 --> 02:30:49.670 align:start position:0%
particular administrator one of her
complaints

02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
is that she has had applicants come in
 
02:30:56.809 --> 02:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
to apply to work at her facility
 
02:30:59.630 --> 02:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
after doing a criminal record check
 
02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
and she found that they were employable
 
02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
okay if they had a large a long criminal
 
02:31:09.469 --> 02:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
record with felonies by state rule
 
02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
Hep 804 and Hep 805 she cannot hire
 
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
someone with a with a felony
 
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
nor can she hire someone who appears on
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
the beas registry which is a registry of
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
people who have founded complaints
 
02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
against them of abuse neglect or
 
02:31:26.220 --> 02:31:27.889 align:start position:0%
against them of abuse neglect or
exploitation

02:31:27.889 --> 02:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
exploitation
 
02:31:30.050 --> 02:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
all right so these people have come to
 
02:31:32.330 --> 02:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
her she has turned them away and two
 
02:31:33.889 --> 02:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
weeks later they come to her as a
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative of the agency
 
02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:38.630 align:start position:0%
representative of the agency
okay

02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:43.969 --> 02:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
the bill in its current form on page
 
02:31:47.570 --> 02:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
oops excuse me on the second page
 
02:31:53.210 --> 02:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.530 --> 02:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh 15 15 and 16.
 
02:32:05.090 --> 02:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
says nurse agencies may not facilitate
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
the placement of any licensed
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
professional with a license that is
 
02:32:11.630 --> 02:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
suspended I would like to suggest that
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
we make an addition to that line I've
 
02:32:15.530 --> 02:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
talked to uh about this with a sponsor
 
02:32:16.969 --> 02:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
of the bill and a couple of the other
 
02:32:16.979 --> 02:32:18.349 align:start position:0%
of the bill and a couple of the other
stakeholders

02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
the issue here is that Residential Care
 
02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
Homes and employ a fair amount of staff
 
02:32:26.090 --> 02:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
that is not licensed
 
02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:26.870 align:start position:0%
that is not licensed
um

02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:29.450 --> 02:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
they're called pcas or caregivers
 
02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
they're called many different things but
 
02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
under the licensing rules they are not
 
02:32:35.809 --> 02:32:35.819 align:start position:0%
required necessarily to have licensing
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
staffs depending on what their function
 
02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
is so many of the basic caregivers are
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
not licensed
 
02:32:43.130 --> 02:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that we might add to
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
this something along the lines of let me
 
02:32:48.410 --> 02:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
see if I can read my own writing
 
02:32:50.570 --> 02:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
um nor will they facilitate the
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
placement of an individual who is not
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
employable under the DHHS administrative
 
02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
rules for the setting in which they will
 
02:32:57.240 --> 02:32:59.809 align:start position:0%
rules for the setting in which they will
work

02:32:59.809 --> 02:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:02.450 --> 02:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay in other words if they are on the
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
beas registry or they have committed a
 
02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:05.690 align:start position:0%
beas registry or they have committed a
felony

02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
felony
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:09.359 --> 02:33:10.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
I spent as I said the last few days
 
02:33:14.270 --> 02:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
talking to people my general experiences
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
have been that once I called someone I
 
02:33:18.290 --> 02:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
was on the phone for an hour
 
02:33:21.290 --> 02:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
the a lot of people have a lot of
 
02:33:23.690 --> 02:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
venting to do over these issues
 
02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and again I don't know if it's going
 
02:33:29.630 --> 02:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
to lower costs it will in some instances
 
02:33:32.210 --> 02:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
if it can eliminate the bidding for this
 
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
for an individual for the same shift
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
have some moderation on costs I would
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
think and I don't see how it's
 
02:33:41.929 --> 02:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to raise costs because
 
02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
nothing in this is particularly onerous
 
02:33:46.490 --> 02:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
for the agencies so again uh as a
 
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:47.880 align:start position:0%

02:33:50.270 --> 02:33:50.280 align:start position:0%

thank you are there questions
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%

02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
said your name I'm Gary Cohen
 
02:34:13.370 --> 02:34:13.380 align:start position:0%

okay uh for 37 years I owned an operated
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
friendship manner
 
02:34:28.730 --> 02:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
um in New Ipswich we closed last May
 
02:34:32.450 --> 02:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
due to short staffing we couldn't staff
 
02:34:34.969 --> 02:34:34.979 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you Mr Capone
 
02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:37.800 align:start position:0%

02:34:41.399 --> 02:34:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
LaCroix

02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.010 --> 02:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Vice chair and
 
02:34:59.690 --> 02:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
distinguished members my name is Jeffrey
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Lacroix and I'm here today to testify in
 
02:35:05.330 --> 02:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
support of sb149 relative to nurse
 
02:35:08.030 --> 02:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
agencies and a free market system the
 
02:35:10.010 --> 02:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
consumer selects their vendor based on a
 
02:35:12.050 --> 02:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
variety of options including price
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
demand and availability prior to covid
 
02:35:17.389 --> 02:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
although High rates for contract staff
 
02:35:19.490 --> 02:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
were more reasonable however the race
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
for the same contracts doubled and at
 
02:35:24.290 --> 02:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
times tripled because of Hazard pay
 
02:35:26.690 --> 02:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
typically agency staff are individuals
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
from another state looking to make a
 
02:35:30.650 --> 02:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
higher wage than they would receive as a
 
02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
permanent staff member this is money
 
02:35:34.730 --> 02:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
leaving and not benefiting New Hampshire
 
02:35:36.650 --> 02:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
residents we were obligated to protect
 
02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
the resident's safety and well-being and
 
02:35:40.910 --> 02:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do so we have to ensure we know
 
02:35:43.250 --> 02:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
exactly who these caregivers are and if
 
02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
they are and if they have markings on
 
02:35:47.210 --> 02:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
their license sometimes a challenge with
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
out-of-state workers
 
02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
these agencies identified and leveraged
 
02:35:54.410 --> 02:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to financially benefit on
 
02:35:56.270 --> 02:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
the backs of nursing homes during the
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
federal state of emergency each
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
increasing their hourly rate and
 
02:36:03.530 --> 02:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
introduction to hazardous pay all of
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
which the agencies Justified due to
 
02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
demand the potential for staff to
 
02:36:10.450 --> 02:36:10.460 align:start position:0%
acquire covid and housing difficulties
 
02:36:12.889 --> 02:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
initially we continued with our old
 
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
rates but found ourselves without agency
 
02:36:17.929 --> 02:36:17.939 align:start position:0%
staff because the agency staff became
 
02:36:20.450 --> 02:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
and continued to become entitled to
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
these inflated rates we experienced
 
02:36:25.490 --> 02:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
multiple situations in which we place an
 
02:36:27.290 --> 02:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
agency staff member on the schedule for
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
a 13-week contract only to be told a few
 
02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
days before the start that there was a
 
02:36:33.889 --> 02:36:33.899 align:start position:0%
cancellation because they were given
 
02:36:37.309 --> 02:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
another higher at a higher rate creating
 
02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
a bidding war which is what you've been
 
02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:39.770 align:start position:0%
a bidding war which is what you've been
hearing

02:36:39.770 --> 02:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:36:42.050 --> 02:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
within the first 11 months of the fiscal
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
year my building has spent the following
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
on agency Staffing one million three
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty thousand three
 
02:36:50.290 --> 02:36:50.300 align:start position:0%
hundred fifty one on lnas
 
02:36:57.770 --> 02:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
996 968 on LPNs and 149 170 on RNs for a
 
02:37:00.950 --> 02:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
total of over 2.5 million dollars
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
we have become subject to the
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
normalization of these inflated rates
 
02:37:07.250 --> 02:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
and at times duplicitous acts none of
 
02:37:08.990 --> 02:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
which are acceptable in a free market
 
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:09.950 align:start position:0%
which are acceptable in a free market
system

02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
with a census of over 60 Medicaid and
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
now delays on the Medicaid approval
 
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
process we have significant Interruption
 
02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
of payment and cash flow concerns and we
 
02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
find ourselves struggling to offer the
 
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
programming our residents rightfully
 
02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:24.170 align:start position:0%
programming our residents rightfully
deserved

02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
deserved
 
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
the staffing agencies have collectively
 
02:37:29.090 --> 02:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
cornered the market resulting in a
 
02:37:31.610 --> 02:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
financially unseenable unsustainable
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
solution to our staffing crisis this is
 
02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
not an acceptable practice and a free
 
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
market system particularly since
 
02:37:39.770 --> 02:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is provided from the
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid
 
02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time and
 
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
deliberation on these important matters
 
02:37:47.929 --> 02:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
and affecting our Health Care system and
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
stand ready to answer any questions that
 
02:37:52.250 --> 02:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
I don't see any at the moment thank you
 
02:37:59.690 --> 02:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:38:04.849 --> 02:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
testify on Senate bill 149.
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
save yourself some bother and put the
 
02:38:14.690 --> 02:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:16.250 --> 02:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
02:38:17.809 --> 02:38:17.819 align:start position:0%
committee Lindsey Courtney executive
 
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
director oplc oplc does not take a
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but I would
 
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
suggest if this bill does move forward
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
that 326 B is not the appropriate
 
02:38:30.969 --> 02:38:30.979 align:start position:0%
placement for this bill
 
02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
326b is the board of nursing practice
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
Act and the bill as amended appears to
 
02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
Grant authority to the office and not to
 
02:38:45.170 --> 02:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing and so we think
 
02:38:46.730 --> 02:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
greater Clarity is needed and that
 
02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps it needs to be placed elsewhere
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
or in its own statutory provision
 
02:38:58.849 --> 02:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
if uh Warren worn out our questions but
 
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
oh representative black history I think
 
02:39:06.530 --> 02:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
one brief brief one um so it appears
 
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
when we heard that uh there are nurses
 
02:39:10.849 --> 02:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
being placed by the staffing agency in
 
02:39:13.130 --> 02:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
um aren't licensable I guess and what's
 
02:39:17.809 --> 02:39:17.819 align:start position:0%
the legal status of that I mean how is
 
02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
it they're able to practice here
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
at all and um
 
02:39:26.570 --> 02:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
and what would oplc do if they learned
 
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
they were informed that there was
 
02:39:31.490 --> 02:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
somebody acting as a nurse here who um
 
02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
you know was on that list or convicted
 
02:39:34.969 --> 02:39:34.979 align:start position:0%
of felonies or whatever
 
02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
I mean how are they here through the
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
nursing compact something else
 
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure representative I think
 
02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:39:45.050 --> 02:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
those prohibitions may fall under the
 
02:39:47.469 --> 02:39:47.479 align:start position:0%
DHHS rules and not the licensure rules
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
because we certainly would check for
 
02:39:54.050 --> 02:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
qualifications at licensure renewal but
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
there are unlicensed Personnel that work
 
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
in facilities if the registration were
 
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
to move forward like any sort of
 
02:40:04.849 --> 02:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
registration licensure certification
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
requirement if there was a violation
 
02:40:11.090 --> 02:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
that would be considered discipline and
 
02:40:12.770 --> 02:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
you could take a number of actions to
 
02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
include reprimand find up to revocation
 
02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
of the ability to practice
 
02:40:21.469 --> 02:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up yep but just as the
 
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
law stands today you know I understand
 
02:40:25.250 --> 02:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
they have staff that aren't aren't
 
02:40:27.469 --> 02:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
nurses and aren't we don't license but
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
if it is somebody who's licensed by New
 
02:40:32.750 --> 02:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh a nurse in Illinois or
 
02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:34.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh a nurse in Illinois or
whatever

02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:40:36.590 --> 02:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
um you know what could or would oplc do
 
02:40:38.690 --> 02:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
if let's say the facility notified him
 
02:40:40.250 --> 02:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
that the agency had placed somebody like
 
02:40:41.210 --> 02:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
that here
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
I think that would probably be a
 
02:40:44.030 --> 02:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
violation of the registration
 
02:40:46.490 --> 02:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
requirements um better set forth in this
 
02:40:48.830 --> 02:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
and we even treat it in that manner a
 
02:40:51.770 --> 02:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up I meant you know if
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
right now today without this bill at all
 
02:40:58.010 --> 02:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
oh as it stands now well see licensure
 
02:41:01.250 --> 02:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
and health facilities have different
 
02:41:03.010 --> 02:41:03.020 align:start position:0%
um criteria when it comes to for example
 
02:41:06.530 --> 02:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
criminal convictions we don't have a
 
02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
general prohibition on felony
 
02:41:11.690 --> 02:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
convictions with the exception of RN in
 
02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
the nurse compact licensure act so it
 
02:41:16.250 --> 02:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
could be that so as I understood it I
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
heard that Health Facilities which is
 
02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS has a general prohibition on felony
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
convictions from a licensure standpoint
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
we don't under 332g we have to engage in
 
02:41:27.170 --> 02:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
analysis as to whether or not somebody
 
02:41:29.630 --> 02:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
is more likely to offend with the
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
license than without it so it could be
 
02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
that you have a license but you aren't
 
02:41:36.290 --> 02:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
authorized to work in a DHHS facility
 
02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
and and briefly you follow up and then
 
02:41:41.929 --> 02:41:41.939 align:start position:0%
um you know the registration habits
 
02:41:44.090 --> 02:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
people being placed who have licensed or
 
02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
suspended but even without this I mean
 
02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
if oplc was notified of it wouldn't that
 
02:41:51.290 --> 02:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
be a problem for somebody who New
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would require licensing if
 
02:41:54.650 --> 02:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
they have a suspended license oh
 
02:41:56.030 --> 02:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
certainly yes if they're practicing
 
02:41:58.130 --> 02:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
without a license yes we would take
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
action thank you all right thank you yes
 
02:42:03.410 --> 02:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
and it appears we aren't familiar with
 
02:42:05.809 --> 02:42:05.819 align:start position:0%
the HHS requirements but they are
 
02:42:05.819 --> 02:42:07.250 align:start position:0%
the HHS requirements but they are
rigorous

02:42:07.250 --> 02:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
rigorous
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
all right I believe this will be going
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
to representative blackis's subcommittee
 
02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:19.370 --> 02:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
I haven't closed the hearing yet I'm
 
02:42:25.969 --> 02:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:35.090 --> 02:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
committee for indulging me at this hour
 
02:42:41.690 --> 02:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
um my name is Bruce Berkey I'm with C
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
Infinity Capital group here in town and
 
02:42:46.670 --> 02:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
we represent Interim HealthCare which is
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
a manchester-based
 
02:42:51.070 --> 02:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
healthcare staffing
 
02:42:54.050 --> 02:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
organization and business as well as the
 
02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
American Staffing Association you heard
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
both of those entities referenced during
 
02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony and I was not
 
02:43:03.770 --> 02:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
intending to testify today in fact I
 
02:43:05.450 --> 02:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
didn't even bring my orange badge I
 
02:43:07.309 --> 02:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't intending to testify so I
 
02:43:07.319 --> 02:43:09.349 align:start position:0%
wasn't intending to testify so I
apologize

02:43:09.349 --> 02:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
02:43:13.010 --> 02:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
um but I I uh we do support this current
 
02:43:15.889 --> 02:43:15.899 align:start position:0%
language that's before you today we did
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
not support the bill as introduced over
 
02:43:19.550 --> 02:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
in the Senate because it was very
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
invasive of private business practices
 
02:43:26.450 --> 02:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
um a registration process that is in
 
02:43:30.530 --> 02:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 149 now is appropriate
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
some of the business practices that are
 
02:43:37.130 --> 02:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
discussed on page two are appropriate
 
02:43:39.950 --> 02:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
um but going beyond that as some of the
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
previous speakers suggested with
 
02:43:46.010 --> 02:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
you know this being a first step or this
 
02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:52.190 --> 02:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
I think going beyond what you have
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
before you today is
 
02:43:58.250 --> 02:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
invading having state government take
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
steps into private business activities
 
02:44:03.650 --> 02:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
that are not appropriate
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we oppose the original bill
 
02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
on the Senate side
 
02:44:10.969 --> 02:44:10.979 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're okay with it as it
 
02:44:12.530 --> 02:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
is before you today
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try and address any
 
02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:15.889 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try and address any
questions

02:44:15.889 --> 02:44:15.899 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:44:17.809 --> 02:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:19.969 --> 02:44:19.979 align:start position:0%
don't see any immediate questions but
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the subcommittee would be
 
02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
delighted to talk with you I will be
 
02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
there very good all right as long as
 
02:44:28.929 --> 02:44:28.939 align:start position:0%
it's not next Thursday or Friday
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
next Thursday we're kind of busy okay
 
02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
yes you are that's right
 
02:44:36.110 --> 02:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you is there anyone else
 
02:44:38.210 --> 02:44:38.220 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair good afternoon
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:33:18.469 --> 03:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
my name is Becky Whitley I'm honored to
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
serve Senate District 15 which includes
 
03:33:22.490 --> 03:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
the wonderful communities of Beau
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
Concord Penacook and Hopkinton so today
 
03:33:27.110 --> 03:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to introduce Senate Bill 126
 
03:33:30.110 --> 03:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
and this bill will allow broader access
 
03:33:33.469 --> 03:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
to treatment for residents at the New
 
03:33:35.389 --> 03:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Corrections so I
 
03:33:37.130 --> 03:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
think this committee is well aware that
 
03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
access to treatment in particular access
 
03:33:41.690 --> 03:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
to mental health treatment is limited
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
for all Granite Staters but compounded
 
03:33:46.370 --> 03:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
with additional challenges in a
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
correctional setting the crisis is even
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
more acute so I introduced this bill at
 
03:33:52.429 --> 03:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
the request of the Department of
 
03:33:54.410 --> 03:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
Corrections and I really do commend them
 
03:33:57.769 --> 03:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
for their commitment to ensuring that
 
03:33:59.450 --> 03:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
their residents get adequate treatment
 
03:34:02.090 --> 03:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
and in a timely way
 
03:34:02.100 --> 03:34:02.750 align:start position:0%
and in a timely way
um

03:34:02.750 --> 03:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh I am happy to take any questions but
 
03:34:06.530 --> 03:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections is here to
 
03:34:08.210 --> 03:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
answer any more specific questions I
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
think they they also see it as a safety
 
03:34:13.370 --> 03:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
issue we do know that anytime that there
 
03:34:15.530 --> 03:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
is a transport that that's a safety
 
03:34:17.570 --> 03:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
issue and I think access to Telehealth
 
03:34:17.580 --> 03:34:18.590 align:start position:0%
issue and I think access to Telehealth
would

03:34:18.590 --> 03:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:34:20.990 --> 03:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
um allow less of those transfers for
 
03:34:22.729 --> 03:34:22.739 align:start position:0%
certain residents
 
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
um this bill enjoyed broad support in
 
03:34:28.490 --> 03:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
the Senate unanimous out of committee
 
03:34:30.349 --> 03:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it may have been
 
03:34:32.809 --> 03:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
even on the consent calendar
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
um there was a minor amendment in the
 
03:34:36.769 --> 03:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
Senate just to ensure that whoever is
 
03:34:39.229 --> 03:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
providing mental health treatment
 
03:34:41.090 --> 03:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
um not only you know certified license
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
but also is is in good standing in their
 
03:34:45.710 --> 03:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
state so with that I asked for the
 
03:34:47.990 --> 03:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee's support of Senate Bill 126
 
03:34:49.610 --> 03:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any questions
 
03:34:49.620 --> 03:34:50.690 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any questions
oh

03:34:50.690 --> 03:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:34:52.309 --> 03:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator are there any
 
03:34:52.319 --> 03:34:54.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator are there any
questions

03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:58.130 --> 03:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
excellent job no questions easy on me
 
03:34:59.450 --> 03:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
today thank you I'm going to go back to
 
03:35:01.190 --> 03:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
my session all right
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:16.370 --> 03:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and honorable
 
03:35:17.630 --> 03:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:35:19.130 --> 03:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
my name is Helen Hanks I'm the
 
03:35:20.210 --> 03:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
Corrections I appreciate Senator Whitley
 
03:35:24.429 --> 03:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
and the other sponsors of this bill
 
03:35:27.170 --> 03:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
supporting it to this path forward our
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
goal is is what would appear simple for
 
03:35:33.790 --> 03:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
Corrections we know and are proud of Our
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
obligation and requirement to provide
 
03:35:37.969 --> 03:35:37.979 align:start position:0%
constitutionally appropriate access to
 
03:35:40.429 --> 03:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
health care services and we see this as
 
03:35:42.710 --> 03:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
an opportunity both as a safety net but
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
as a responsibility to acknowledge that
 
03:35:46.910 --> 03:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
there are Specialties across the country
 
03:35:49.429 --> 03:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
in addition to General needs in
 
03:35:51.229 --> 03:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry primarily but it's not
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
exclusive to those areas of service
 
03:35:55.309 --> 03:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
where we have in the past had to
 
03:35:57.650 --> 03:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
appropriately pay a national expert to
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
fly to the state of New Hampshire engage
 
03:36:02.809 --> 03:36:02.819 align:start position:0%
in on-site treatment services and and
 
03:36:05.630 --> 03:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
time technology has progressed we really
 
03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we can be nimble
 
03:36:10.370 --> 03:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
when those unique instances surface but
 
03:36:12.290 --> 03:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
also be responsive on a regular basis
 
03:36:14.570 --> 03:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
because we know nationally and within
 
03:36:16.910 --> 03:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
our our own State recruiting psychiatric
 
03:36:18.170 --> 03:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
providers and other health care
 
03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
providers to work specifically in a
 
03:36:22.250 --> 03:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
correction setting is a challenge when
 
03:36:23.690 --> 03:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
we're having a struggle to do those in
 
03:36:25.790 --> 03:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
community settings so we really want to
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
be able to maximize both our existing
 
03:36:29.570 --> 03:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
contract we will always have a
 
03:36:31.490 --> 03:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
contracted Health Care Service partner
 
03:36:33.229 --> 03:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
and they have other licensed
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
professionals across the country
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
providing Correctional service I think
 
03:36:38.929 --> 03:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
it is unrealistic to expect a national
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
partner to get all of their licensed
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
providers licensed in all of the states
 
03:36:44.750 --> 03:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
in which they're contracted and this is
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
not intended to be a full-time resource
 
03:36:50.090 --> 03:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
it's really a gap Gap when we don't have
 
03:36:52.250 --> 03:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
the Staffing and or we need a national
 
03:36:55.010 --> 03:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
expert I've provided testimony I know
 
03:36:56.450 --> 03:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
you will read through it and look at
 
03:36:58.130 --> 03:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
those resources I will not read it to
 
03:37:00.530 --> 03:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
you but those are the primary issues
 
03:37:02.690 --> 03:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
we're looking looking to solve in this
 
03:37:04.250 --> 03:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and with that I
 
03:37:05.570 --> 03:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
certainly Avail myself to any questions
 
03:37:07.849 --> 03:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you commissioner
 
03:37:10.389 --> 03:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
I have a question yes uh you mentioned
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
that this only addresses
 
03:37:15.469 --> 03:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
Physicians and Physicians assistants
 
03:37:17.570 --> 03:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
what about other Mental Health
 
03:37:17.580 --> 03:37:23.830 align:start position:0%
what about other Mental Health
Counselors

03:37:23.830 --> 03:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:26.570 --> 03:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
right it wouldn't include psychologists
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
or or social workers or latex or
 
03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:31.070 align:start position:0%
or or social workers or latex or
whomever

03:37:31.070 --> 03:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
whomever
 
03:37:33.410 --> 03:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
no we were looking specifically at the
 
03:37:37.250 --> 03:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
psychiatric provider licensed positions
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
in that in that realm we certainly could
 
03:37:41.929 --> 03:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
consider psychiatric nurse practitioners
 
03:37:45.170 --> 03:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
but our hardest Gap to Phil had been a
 
03:37:48.229 --> 03:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist or again National experts
 
03:37:50.510 --> 03:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
that are usually psychiatrists
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
but we would not be offended by
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
increasing the opportunity to other
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
psychiatric providers so the
 
03:37:59.630 --> 03:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
all right find as long as you're aware
 
03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's my question other
 
03:38:02.040 --> 03:38:03.590 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's my question other
questions

03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:38:05.870 --> 03:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart
 
03:38:06.889 --> 03:38:06.899 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
are with the services that you need to
 
03:38:11.630 --> 03:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
be filled are these mandated or this is
 
03:38:13.570 --> 03:38:13.580 align:start position:0%
inmates coming to you for voluntary
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Services or is this part of
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
their sentence
 
03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
that's a great question uh
 
03:38:20.510 --> 03:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative treatment services are
 
03:38:20.520 --> 03:38:21.410 align:start position:0%
representative treatment services are
not

03:38:21.410 --> 03:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:38:24.050 --> 03:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
um forced so these are services that
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
we've assessed individuals for treatment
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
needs and then we provide the providers
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
to help them with their treatment needs
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
then follow up so there's no penalty for
 
03:38:37.490 --> 03:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
not participating
 
03:38:40.250 --> 03:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
no sir that would be unconstitutional
 
03:38:42.889 --> 03:38:42.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:44.809 --> 03:38:44.819 align:start position:0%
we would not approve of that any other
 
03:38:44.819 --> 03:38:47.769 align:start position:0%
we would not approve of that any other
questions

03:38:47.769 --> 03:38:47.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:49.550 --> 03:38:49.560 align:start position:0%

Society of physician assistance I did
 
03:39:24.650 --> 03:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
submit a letter uh online but I'm happy
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
to resubmit if that didn't get through
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
to you the Pas don't have any position
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
on the bill but uh and I think you'll
 
03:39:34.849 --> 03:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
sense a common theme uh usually I'm
 
03:39:38.330 --> 03:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
before if it's this committee or HHS
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
because the Pas have been either
 
03:39:44.269 --> 03:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
inadvertently excluded from a bill or
 
03:39:47.330 --> 03:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
the and as in the case here they've
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
there the profession has been either
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
incorrectly spelled or or referenced and
 
03:39:54.290 --> 03:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:39:57.650 --> 03:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
um along those lines uh of course you
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
all know that Pas are physician
 
03:40:01.550 --> 03:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
assistants they're not assistants to
 
03:40:05.150 --> 03:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
Physicians uh and so I'm hoping that
 
03:40:07.250 --> 03:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
um an amendment could be brought for to
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
just simply correct a few misspellings
 
03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to point them out if if
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's okay and I did note them in the
 
03:40:17.570 --> 03:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the letter that we sent
 
03:40:21.050 --> 03:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
over uh first of all just on a
 
03:40:23.929 --> 03:40:23.939 align:start position:0%
the uh I guess the cover of the bill if
 
03:40:26.269 --> 03:40:26.279 align:start position:0%
you will uh the description of the ACT
 
03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh relative to uh you'll notice uh where
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
it says a relative to licensure a
 
03:40:36.170 --> 03:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
physician and Physicians assistants that
 
03:40:38.330 --> 03:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
asks at the end of physician should be
 
03:40:40.250 --> 03:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
deleted it should just say physician
 
03:40:40.260 --> 03:40:42.469 align:start position:0%
deleted it should just say physician
assistance

03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
03:40:44.929 --> 03:40:44.939 align:start position:0%
in the analysis on that same page the
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
same mistake is made licensure
 
03:40:49.969 --> 03:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
Physicians and Physicians assistants and
 
03:40:51.610 --> 03:40:51.620 align:start position:0%
it should say physician assistant
 
03:40:56.929 --> 03:40:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.939 --> 03:40:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:01.130 --> 03:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
also uh
 
03:41:03.889 --> 03:41:03.899 align:start position:0%
again in the bill itself the description
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the act at the very top the same
 
03:41:07.370 --> 03:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
mistake there's an S at the end of
 
03:41:10.729 --> 03:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
physician and physician assistance
 
03:41:10.739 --> 03:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
physician and physician assistance
um

03:41:11.510 --> 03:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
and then in the bill on line 12
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
for Physicians where it should be
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
physician assistants
 
03:41:25.010 --> 03:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
bless you madam chair
 
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
I note though that they the the
 
03:41:29.210 --> 03:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
appropriate references made on lines
 
03:41:30.830 --> 03:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
eight and ten of the bill where it has
 
03:41:34.190 --> 03:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
physician and physician assistant or
 
03:41:37.130 --> 03:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
physician assistant so that that is the
 
03:41:40.190 --> 03:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
correct way I'd also note the point out
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal note where it just has the
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
description of the bill uh it has that
 
03:41:46.729 --> 03:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
same mistake where it says where it has
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
the S at the uh at the end of Physicians
 
03:41:52.490 --> 03:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
sir I'm sure that that the title and the
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
description were simply cut and paste
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
right no I'm just just referencing it so
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
that that's all I had I hope that if you
 
03:42:01.969 --> 03:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
know that can be corrected we'd be happy
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh and that is all I had Madam chair
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.040 --> 03:42:09.969 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:42:09.969 --> 03:42:09.979 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:42:12.769 --> 03:42:12.779 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:42:19.010 --> 03:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I would close the
 
03:42:29.929 --> 03:42:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:33.530 --> 03:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
and chair is the corrections that the
 
03:42:36.110 --> 03:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
previous speaker mentioned could that be
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
done as an enrolled Amendment if we note
 
03:42:41.210 --> 03:42:41.220 align:start position:0%

03:42:41.220 --> 03:42:45.050 align:start position:0%

04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:02.450 --> 04:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody it's 2 15 I would
 
04:17:05.229 --> 04:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
like to open the public hearing on sb44
 
04:17:08.450 --> 04:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
and uh welcome Senator Carson
 
04:17:14.630 --> 04:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:17:19.010 --> 04:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
committee uh I am not Senator Carson uh
 
04:17:21.530 --> 04:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
I am a grant bossy deputy chief staff
 
04:17:23.210 --> 04:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Senate pinch
 
04:17:25.490 --> 04:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
hitting for Senator Carson the lead
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor of Senate Bill 44 as you know
 
04:17:30.769 --> 04:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
today is our crossover day in the Senate
 
04:17:34.010 --> 04:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
and the senator is currently I believe
 
04:17:36.050 --> 04:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
in a floor debate on your constitutional
 
04:17:37.969 --> 04:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
amendment on the edge of Judges so she
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
could ask me to fill in for her today
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
last year 355 Granite Staters died due
 
04:17:45.889 --> 04:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
to drug overdose one of the many
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
challenges in combating this wave of
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
addiction is The Chronic Workforce
 
04:17:50.689 --> 04:17:50.699 align:start position:0%
shortage of drug and alcohol use
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
professionals sb44 would expand the
 
04:17:55.130 --> 04:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements for master
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
licensed alcohol and drug counselors
 
04:17:59.990 --> 04:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
under RSA 330 to include mental health
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
and mental health disorders it would
 
04:18:03.889 --> 04:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
also expand the pool of Bachelor level
 
04:18:06.530 --> 04:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
students who qualify for licensure by
 
04:18:08.929 --> 04:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
allowing criminal justice Majors to more
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
easily pursue a career in treatment
 
04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
removing the subjective process
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
currently in place through the licensed
 
04:18:16.670 --> 04:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug counselor board
 
04:18:18.650 --> 04:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
the struggles of mental health disorders
 
04:18:21.250 --> 04:18:21.260 align:start position:0%
and substance use disorder often overlap
 
04:18:23.570 --> 04:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
sp-44 would enable Master's level
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
substance abuse counselors to continue
 
04:18:27.889 --> 04:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
to treat patients should the primary
 
04:18:30.170 --> 04:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
diagnosis change from mental health or
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
substance use or back
 
04:18:33.769 --> 04:18:33.779 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson thanks for your
 
04:18:35.090 --> 04:18:35.100 align:start position:0%

chair McGuire plans on sending this to
 
04:18:51.530 --> 04:18:51.540 align:start position:0%

04:19:22.849 --> 04:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Representatives my name
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
is Jake Berry I'm the vice president of
 
04:19:26.570 --> 04:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
policy at new Futures as many of you
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
know we're a nonpartisan non-profit
 
04:19:30.050 --> 04:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
Health policy and advocacy organization
 
04:19:31.849 --> 04:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
we've been working for more than 25
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
years to address issues related to
 
04:19:35.090 --> 04:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
alcohol and substance use and mental
 
04:19:37.250 --> 04:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
health issues in our state uh I don't
 
04:19:39.290 --> 04:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
want to repeat too much of what Mr bossy
 
04:19:40.849 --> 04:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
said here this afternoon but I do want
 
04:19:43.010 --> 04:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
to emphasize new Futures strong support
 
04:19:45.170 --> 04:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
for this bill I know I don't need to
 
04:19:46.849 --> 04:19:46.859 align:start position:0%
tell any of you uh that for years
 
04:19:48.769 --> 04:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages have been one of the
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
biggest barriers to overcoming our
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
state's addiction crisis throughout our
 
04:19:54.889 --> 04:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
substance use system uh the lack of
 
04:19:56.330 --> 04:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
counselors and other professionals make
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
it impossible for many individuals and
 
04:19:59.570 --> 04:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
families to access the treatment they
 
04:19:59.580 --> 04:20:00.290 align:start position:0%
families to access the treatment they
need

04:20:00.290 --> 04:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
SB 44 alone won't solve all of our
 
04:20:04.490 --> 04:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues but it will take
 
04:20:06.170 --> 04:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
several important steps to bring more
 
04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
people into the workforce and help help
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
get treatment to more people in need
 
04:20:12.290 --> 04:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
first as you heard Mr bossy say this
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
will allow mastered license and alcohol
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
drug counselors to treat mental health
 
04:20:17.570 --> 04:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
cases as well as substance use and
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
co-occurring disorders there's a great
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
deal of overlap as you'll hear this
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon in Education and Training
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
between the substance use and mental
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
health treatment fields and Master's
 
04:20:28.969 --> 04:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
levels Mental Health Counselors are
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
currently allowed to treat substance use
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
cases so we're just trying to even the
 
04:20:36.050 --> 04:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
playing field to some extent this would
 
04:20:37.729 --> 04:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
align these scopes of practice and allow
 
04:20:39.290 --> 04:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
masters of level substance use
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
counselors to treat more people in need
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
to continue and to continue to treat
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
established patients even as their
 
04:20:46.729 --> 04:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
primary diagnosis changes between
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
substance use and mental health and
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
mental health as it often does
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh secondly sb44 would bring us one step
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
closer to Reciprocity for our recover
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
for our recovery Workforce by aligning
 
04:20:59.210 --> 04:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's continuing education
 
04:21:01.370 --> 04:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
requirements for Certified Recovery
 
04:21:03.950 --> 04:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
support workers uh with those set by the
 
04:21:04.969 --> 04:21:04.979 align:start position:0%
international credentialing
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
organizations that sets these national
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
standards by allowing these requirements
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
this would set the table for the late
 
04:21:12.290 --> 04:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
act board to pursue Reciprocity for
 
04:21:16.189 --> 04:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
crsws should so choose so that's a basic
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
overview of what this bill does as you
 
04:21:20.269 --> 04:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
can see from the sign-in list we have a
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
broad Coalition of supporters across the
 
04:21:24.349 --> 04:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
substance use Mental Health and Health
 
04:21:26.210 --> 04:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
Care Spectrum including the National
 
04:21:28.250 --> 04:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
Association of Social Workers Nami New
 
04:21:29.809 --> 04:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the medical society the
 
04:21:31.849 --> 04:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
hospital Association by state Primary
 
04:21:34.490 --> 04:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
Care Association and others uh simply
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
put we believe this will create greater
 
04:21:38.090 --> 04:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
flexibility and efficiency in licensing
 
04:21:39.769 --> 04:21:39.779 align:start position:0%
and to help get treatment to more people
 
04:21:41.210 --> 04:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
in need
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I do it sounds like this will be
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
going to a subcommittee I do have a
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
draft language for a very very minor
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh there there are three
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
pieces the amendment and I'm happy to
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
share this with you all uh two of them
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
are just chain uh are just wording
 
04:21:57.650 --> 04:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
changes to clarify definitions uh one of
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
one of them would remove the
 
04:22:03.530 --> 04:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
um the criminal justice degree provision
 
04:22:05.570 --> 04:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
that was included in there we've heard
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
over recent weeks some questions about
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
whether the criminal justice curriculum
 
04:22:11.929 --> 04:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
aligns fully with uh
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
um with substance use training and so
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
while we thought that uh maybe taking
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
that out for now and working through
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
that might be a good way to go
 
04:22:22.189 --> 04:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'm happy to take any
 
04:22:23.929 --> 04:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
questions but I know that uh my
 
04:22:25.370 --> 04:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
colleagues in back of you can speak in
 
04:22:26.809 --> 04:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
more detail to any of this than I can
 
04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take questions yes
 
04:22:31.729 --> 04:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr Berry this
 
04:22:34.010 --> 04:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you're speaking about
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
um is it the one that you sent to me it
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
is yes okay I have distributed it
 
04:22:39.410 --> 04:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
throughout this committee wonderful
 
04:22:41.450 --> 04:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative very much
 
04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative yeah just um one
 
04:22:46.130 --> 04:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
thing so the changes in the licensing
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
requirement to align it with the
 
04:22:52.250 --> 04:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
The Wider standards um I'd have to go
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
back on the bill but just briefly do
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
they increase the amount of training
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
required uh reduce it what kind of
 
04:22:59.630 --> 04:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
changes for the 16th for that we're
 
04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
talking about for the continuing
 
04:23:03.769 --> 04:23:03.779 align:start position:0%
education hours required for uh crsw
 
04:23:06.410 --> 04:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
recertification it increases it if I'm
 
04:23:09.769 --> 04:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
recalling this right from 16 to 24. my
 
04:23:10.969 --> 04:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
understanding is that many of these
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
professionals are already engaging in 24
 
04:23:14.570 --> 04:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
hours this shouldn't create any more of
 
04:23:16.250 --> 04:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
a hurdle for them but by aligning it
 
04:23:17.689 --> 04:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
with the national requirement again it
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
would make us more eligible for
 
04:23:21.650 --> 04:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
reciprocity follow up you know that's in
 
04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
part 10 I see that but in part nine
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
section 9 it's talking about the initial
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
licensing and so what's the uh
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
the substance and the key points of the
 
04:23:33.550 --> 04:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
changes there
 
04:23:37.490 --> 04:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh I apologize page three this is line
 
04:23:40.849 --> 04:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
nine you know if you don't mind we have
 
04:23:41.929 --> 04:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
some uh folks from the treatment
 
04:23:43.250 --> 04:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
community in back of us who might be
 
04:23:46.370 --> 04:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
able to speak more directly than I can
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind any other questions
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:23:54.650 --> 04:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
I apologize ahead of time Diane
 
04:23:56.640 --> 04:24:06.769 align:start position:0%

04:24:27.530 --> 04:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to try to answer representative
 
04:24:32.760 --> 04:24:34.250 align:start position:0%
I'd like to try to answer representative
Lexus

04:24:34.250 --> 04:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
Lexus
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
Lexus is his question first and that
 
04:24:41.570 --> 04:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm interpreting this
 
04:24:41.580 --> 04:24:43.130 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm interpreting this
correctly

04:24:43.130 --> 04:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
04:24:47.150 --> 04:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
does this change the number of Education
 
04:24:49.250 --> 04:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
hours required for someone to get an m
 
04:24:49.260 --> 04:24:52.670 align:start position:0%
hours required for someone to get an m
laidac

04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.130 --> 04:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
um ours or or any of the requirements I
 
04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
mean my my concern if you can address it
 
04:24:59.570 --> 04:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
is that you know there's already a
 
04:25:01.370 --> 04:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
shortage of people doing it and if there
 
04:25:03.170 --> 04:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
was a substantial increase in the
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
requirement then you know it might make
 
04:25:08.330 --> 04:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
that problem worse but you may like this
 
04:25:10.490 --> 04:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
answer then it does not increase the
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
requirements what it does is it
 
04:25:15.769 --> 04:25:15.779 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the education that they
 
04:25:18.170 --> 04:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
already have and expands the scope of
 
04:25:20.570 --> 04:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
practice so that when they start seeing
 
04:25:23.530 --> 04:25:23.540 align:start position:0%
a client that has co-occurring disorders
 
04:25:25.729 --> 04:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
historically what uh what's happened
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
what happens now is when substance use
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
is no longer
 
04:25:31.439 --> 04:25:32.030 align:start position:0%
is no longer
um

04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
when substitutes become stable
 
04:25:37.250 --> 04:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
and they're primarily treating
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
um a mental health disorder other than
 
04:25:41.630 --> 04:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
substance use by itself
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
the the M latex has to transfer someone
 
04:25:46.729 --> 04:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
to a different clinician
 
04:25:49.729 --> 04:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
and so for example there are some mental
 
04:25:50.929 --> 04:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
health conditions that are chronic
 
04:25:53.210 --> 04:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
long-term conditions
 
04:25:53.220 --> 04:25:54.889 align:start position:0%
long-term conditions
um

04:25:54.889 --> 04:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:56.889 --> 04:25:56.899 align:start position:0%
the one that's easiest for me to say is
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia but you can go you know
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
depression anxiety you know all of these
 
04:26:05.450 --> 04:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
different things they can be complicated
 
04:26:07.490 --> 04:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
with substance use
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
but once you take care of that
 
04:26:12.490 --> 04:26:12.500 align:start position:0%
complication the law currently says that
 
04:26:15.530 --> 04:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
M latex can no longer treat those other
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
disorders when they're by themselves
 
04:26:18.720 --> 04:26:20.769 align:start position:0%
disorders when they're by themselves
so

04:26:20.769 --> 04:26:20.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
this change acknowledges that
 
04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
the M latex does know how to treat
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
mental health disorders they have been
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
treating mental health disorders because
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're treating those that are
 
04:26:32.710 --> 04:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
Complicated by addiction
 
04:26:35.149 --> 04:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't mean they know any less
 
04:26:37.010 --> 04:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
about those mental health disorders when
 
04:26:39.170 --> 04:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
addiction is no longer present okay
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
so the training the Emily decks have had
 
04:26:44.929 --> 04:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
covers a broad range of mental health
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
disorders not just the ones related to
 
04:26:49.630 --> 04:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
drug alcohol use absolutely they have
 
04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the exact same college
 
04:26:52.560 --> 04:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the exact same college
education

04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:26:56.950 --> 04:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
60 credit master's degrees
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
the language for the education that
 
04:27:02.450 --> 04:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
there need that they need is mirrored by
 
04:27:05.210 --> 04:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
what is also needed within the other
 
04:27:08.750 --> 04:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
Master's level clinicians when we were
 
04:27:13.010 --> 04:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
first proposing this bill in the house
 
04:27:13.020 --> 04:27:13.610 align:start position:0%
first proposing this bill in the house
um

04:27:13.610 --> 04:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
the community Behavioral Health
 
04:27:19.729 --> 04:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
Association had had issue with a piece
 
04:27:22.490 --> 04:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
of it and that was that it included
 
04:27:25.309 --> 04:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh Human Service degrees
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
and in looking at that language
 
04:27:32.330 --> 04:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
um the history of that was examined and
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
Human Service was included because of a
 
04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
degree that existed at a time
 
04:27:41.929 --> 04:27:41.939 align:start position:0%
um I think it was 2010 or 2008 when the
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
when the bill was first created
 
04:27:47.290 --> 04:27:47.300 align:start position:0%
and that program no longer exists so
 
04:27:49.969 --> 04:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
removing Human Service as a required
 
04:27:54.189 --> 04:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
degree for the m laidac
 
04:27:56.809 --> 04:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
maintains that the education is
 
04:27:58.729 --> 04:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
equivalent to what the different Mental
 
04:28:03.889 --> 04:28:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:05.570 --> 04:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
did you want to give other testimony as
 
04:28:05.580 --> 04:28:09.769 align:start position:0%
did you want to give other testimony as
well

04:28:09.769 --> 04:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh yes another question can you write
 
04:28:15.590 --> 04:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
let's say that you have a patient that
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
is that has an underlying mental health
 
04:28:20.689 --> 04:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
condition that's Complicated by
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
drug abuse and you work with that person
 
04:28:25.610 --> 04:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
you develop the relationship with that
 
04:28:27.649 --> 04:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
person and you're able to work through
 
04:28:28.849 --> 04:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
with them
 
04:28:31.010 --> 04:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
their drug abuse issue
 
04:28:34.250 --> 04:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
which may or may not be gone forever
 
04:28:37.729 --> 04:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
and then if once that person is free of
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
the abuse then they are you are required
 
04:28:43.370 --> 04:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
to send them somewhere else where they
 
04:28:44.809 --> 04:28:44.819 align:start position:0%
have to re-establish another
 
04:28:47.330 --> 04:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
relationship and okay that's what I
 
04:28:48.889 --> 04:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
thought thank you
 
04:28:51.889 --> 04:28:51.899 align:start position:0%
yeah the the biggest problem is as
 
04:28:53.929 --> 04:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
people who need counseling services get
 
04:28:55.630 --> 04:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
lost because
 
04:28:57.649 --> 04:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
establishing a relationship with a
 
04:28:59.450 --> 04:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
counselor is a very personal and private
 
04:29:01.490 --> 04:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
thing and once you find someone that
 
04:29:02.990 --> 04:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
you're working with and it works well
 
04:29:07.269 --> 04:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
and you're able to like adequately
 
04:29:09.710 --> 04:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
stabilize the addiction
 
04:29:11.870 --> 04:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's really a shame to have to say
 
04:29:13.250 --> 04:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay now you have to go work with
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
someone else for the other parts of the
 
04:29:17.389 --> 04:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
mental health condition
 
04:29:20.450 --> 04:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
representative like us thank you um I
 
04:29:22.370 --> 04:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
mean that that makes complete sense uh
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
04:29:25.849 --> 04:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
um you know if they have similar
 
04:29:27.769 --> 04:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
training why is there a separate M ladak
 
04:29:29.689 --> 04:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
or the other mental health professionals
 
04:29:31.670 --> 04:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
do they have some extra specific
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
training related to drug and alcohol
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
abuse is that the main difference there
 
04:29:38.210 --> 04:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
is additional training and one of the
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
other people scheduled to speak has been
 
04:29:43.250 --> 04:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
the primary substance use advocate for
 
04:29:45.130 --> 04:29:45.140 align:start position:0%
all of the building of this profession
 
04:29:47.929 --> 04:29:47.939 align:start position:0%
and so she will probably add to that
 
04:29:49.849 --> 04:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Jackie
 
04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:54.000 --> 04:30:00.349 align:start position:0%
 
when

04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.520 --> 04:30:08.149 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
substance use people could only treat
 
04:30:12.290 --> 04:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
substance use people they couldn't treat
 
04:30:15.110 --> 04:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
people with other mental health
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
disorders at all
 
04:30:19.490 --> 04:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
and it was back then it was considered
 
04:30:21.530 --> 04:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
substance abuse it wasn't considered a
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder like language has
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:31.010 --> 04:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
when the M late deck was created
 
04:30:34.849 --> 04:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
because the rule had always been that an
 
04:30:36.769 --> 04:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
Emily That Couldn't treat
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
a mental health disorder
 
04:30:41.330 --> 04:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
other than substance use
 
04:30:43.490 --> 04:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
a compromise was made that they would
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
only treat within co-occurring and that
 
04:30:49.189 --> 04:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
was an acceptable compromise now the
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
education the testing all of that has
 
04:30:55.969 --> 04:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
become co-occurring and so
 
04:30:58.610 --> 04:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
the the person who
 
04:31:00.649 --> 04:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
was trained to be a substance use
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
counselor many years ago might not have
 
04:31:05.090 --> 04:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
had the same expertise as someone does
 
04:31:05.100 --> 04:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
had the same expertise as someone does
now

04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
does that help answer it I'm just quick
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up just uh give me a
 
04:31:13.490 --> 04:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
simple answer so my understanding and
 
04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong is that that
 
04:31:18.889 --> 04:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
basically M ladak has the same training
 
04:31:21.530 --> 04:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
as more General mental health people but
 
04:31:23.929 --> 04:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
they also have an additional extra
 
04:31:25.849 --> 04:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
specialized training for drug and
 
04:31:28.610 --> 04:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse correct treatment and so
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a a specialty of the mental
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
health area more than a completely
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
separate thing is that correct yeah
 
04:31:34.680 --> 04:31:36.290 align:start position:0%
separate thing is that correct yeah
essentially

04:31:36.290 --> 04:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
um the way without this change
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
in order for a
 
04:31:44.689 --> 04:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
an M laid act to prove that they know
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
how to treat other mental health
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
disorders and to be able to do that when
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
the substance use disappears they had to
 
04:31:52.610 --> 04:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
get two licenses
 
04:31:55.969 --> 04:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
okay and so not only do you have the
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
extra education to be able to treat
 
04:31:59.870 --> 04:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
substance use you had to prove
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
above and beyond everything else that
 
04:32:02.929 --> 04:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
you could do that by getting another
 
04:32:06.110 --> 04:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
license okay thank you
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
unless you have something else to share
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
you're all set um
 
04:32:15.530 --> 04:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
I would encourage the committee I
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
I know that the study committee is going
 
04:32:20.090 --> 04:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
to have a lot involved and I plan and
 
04:32:21.769 --> 04:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
want to be part of every part of the
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:32:25.250 --> 04:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
but I would encourage you to even
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
consider passing this without putting it
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the study committee because of how
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
vital it is for client care
 
04:32:34.309 --> 04:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
let me um clarify that it's not
 
04:32:36.290 --> 04:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
aesthetic memory it's a subcommittee a
 
04:32:37.670 --> 04:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee it's a committee's
 
04:32:39.849 --> 04:32:39.859 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to get something
 
04:32:42.769 --> 04:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
tightened up and neatened up so that so
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
that we can vote on it so we will be
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
voting on it don't worry we're not gonna
 
04:32:48.889 --> 04:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
like don't totally my misunderstanding
 
04:32:50.570 --> 04:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
Thank you
 
04:32:53.809 --> 04:32:53.819 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean what a subset of us that
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
people here will meet and uh go over in
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
more detail
 
04:32:59.809 --> 04:32:59.819 align:start position:0%

it and go over it in more detail and and
 
04:33:09.650 --> 04:33:09.660 align:start position:0%

today

04:33:40.429 --> 04:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:33:42.890 --> 04:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would like to before making
 
04:33:46.010 --> 04:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
any of my own comments address one of uh
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
representative lakas's Lucas I'm trying
 
04:33:49.799 --> 04:33:51.890 align:start position:0%
representative lakas's Lucas I'm trying
uh

04:33:51.890 --> 04:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:55.010 --> 04:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
um questions and that was about is
 
04:33:58.849 --> 04:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
um is the m ladak more of a specialty of
 
04:34:03.051 --> 04:34:03.061 align:start position:0%
mental health uh than a license onto its
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
own and my answer is it is not a
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
specialty of mental health so there is a
 
04:34:13.970 --> 04:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
long history in this profession of
 
04:34:17.689 --> 04:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
growing up through a culture of
 
04:34:21.051 --> 04:34:21.061 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and understanding
 
04:34:25.250 --> 04:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
and building on the understanding of how
 
04:34:28.609 --> 04:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder is not only a
 
04:34:31.490 --> 04:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
complication of Mental Illness but also
 
04:34:35.330 --> 04:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
an illness all on its own and it's not
 
04:34:38.330 --> 04:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
just that uh the folks who have M latex
 
04:34:41.929 --> 04:34:41.939 align:start position:0%
treat substance use disorder along with
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
mental health but they understand they
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
are trained in the integrated care of
 
04:34:51.709 --> 04:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
how to be able to differentially
 
04:34:55.609 --> 04:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
diagnose when a mental illness is uh
 
04:34:57.709 --> 04:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
stands on its own and when their mental
 
04:35:00.170 --> 04:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
illness is caused by the symptoms of
 
04:35:02.209 --> 04:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
mental illness are not really mental
 
04:35:05.209 --> 04:35:05.219 align:start position:0%
illness at all but really a symptom of
 
04:35:08.449 --> 04:35:08.459 align:start position:0%
ongoing use they are trained in how to
 
04:35:10.570 --> 04:35:10.580 align:start position:0%
treat the two disorders together
 
04:35:13.490 --> 04:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
historically what has happened is you
 
04:35:15.410 --> 04:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
treat the mental illness when it comes
 
04:35:17.330 --> 04:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
up you treat the substance use disorder
 
04:35:21.170 --> 04:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
when it presents and what uh what the M
 
04:35:24.769 --> 04:35:24.779 align:start position:0%
late act has been trained to do is know
 
04:35:27.529 --> 04:35:27.539 align:start position:0%
how to treat both even when not one is
 
04:35:31.310 --> 04:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
not active to prevent it from relapsing
 
04:35:34.010 --> 04:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
in the future so it is really its own
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
kind of culture and own profession and
 
04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
what the laidac board has done is
 
04:35:41.449 --> 04:35:41.459 align:start position:0%
created a Workforce letter we we have
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
such a Workforce shortage in this in
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
this state and it has created a
 
04:35:49.070 --> 04:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce ladder whereby you can start
 
04:35:54.429 --> 04:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
as a a peer a peer support person a crsw
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
and build on the knowledge and the
 
04:35:59.810 --> 04:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
education that you gain to get your laid
 
04:36:02.209 --> 04:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
act and build on the knowledge and the
 
04:36:03.949 --> 04:36:03.959 align:start position:0%
education that you gain and it all
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
counts towards your M ladak if that's
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
what you choose to do and so it actually
 
04:36:13.789 --> 04:36:13.799 align:start position:0%
for those people who begin in the peer
 
04:36:16.849 --> 04:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
support realm it shortens their their
 
04:36:20.330 --> 04:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
journey to becoming a master's level
 
04:36:20.340 --> 04:36:21.949 align:start position:0%
journey to becoming a master's level
counselor

04:36:21.949 --> 04:36:21.959 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh the other piece is so
 
04:36:27.840 --> 04:36:29.289 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh the other piece is so
um

04:36:29.289 --> 04:36:29.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:31.369 --> 04:36:31.379 align:start position:0%
just real quickly if you could pull the
 
04:36:34.010 --> 04:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
mic just a little bit closer I'm short
 
04:36:36.470 --> 04:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah especially when you lean back you
 
04:36:39.289 --> 04:36:39.299 align:start position:0%
get a little far away from it okay so um
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
I represent I'm the executive director
 
04:36:43.250 --> 04:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
of an organization known as Horizons
 
04:36:46.029 --> 04:36:46.039 align:start position:0%
Counseling Center we're one of the first
 
04:36:49.369 --> 04:36:49.379 align:start position:0%
coding programs in the state of New
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we uh we opened in 1987 as a
 
04:36:56.330 --> 04:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
co-occurring program
 
04:36:59.209 --> 04:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
um I carry two licenses I carry two
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
licenses and I want to give you an idea
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the practicality of this I carry two
 
04:37:07.070 --> 04:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
licenses because it uh allows me not
 
04:37:11.390 --> 04:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
only to provide services to folks once
 
04:37:15.051 --> 04:37:15.061 align:start position:0%
one of their disorders is not active but
 
04:37:18.109 --> 04:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
it also it's also necessary for me to
 
04:37:22.131 --> 04:37:22.141 align:start position:0%
supervise staff I can't just hire staff
 
04:37:25.609 --> 04:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
who are going to then have to age out
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
and send their people out so the expense
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
of hiring people who have to carry two
 
04:37:34.131 --> 04:37:34.141 align:start position:0%
licenses puts a burden on small
 
04:37:37.609 --> 04:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
organizations like mine and that's
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
another reason that this is such an
 
04:37:43.490 --> 04:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
important difference I was also involved
 
04:37:45.789 --> 04:37:45.799 align:start position:0%
in writing of the initial
 
04:37:49.131 --> 04:37:49.141 align:start position:0%
legislation that went through in 2008
 
04:37:52.209 --> 04:37:52.219 align:start position:0%
creating the unlaid action again in 2010
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh expanding the scope of practice and
 
04:37:57.000 --> 04:37:58.869 align:start position:0%
uh expanding the scope of practice and
the

04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
removal of the full expansion to treat
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
co-occurring disorders when one disorder
 
04:38:08.810 --> 04:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
was no longer active was really a
 
04:38:10.490 --> 04:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
political compromise
 
04:38:13.730 --> 04:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
and it was a way of saying
 
04:38:16.429 --> 04:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
um we understand that there's a lot of
 
04:38:20.029 --> 04:38:20.039 align:start position:0%
territoriality going on and
 
04:38:22.970 --> 04:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
will defer as long as we can do the work
 
04:38:25.010 --> 04:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
that we've done but what we've learned
 
04:38:28.369 --> 04:38:28.379 align:start position:0%
over these last years is having people
 
04:38:30.650 --> 04:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
transfer to someone else
 
04:38:32.631 --> 04:38:32.641 align:start position:0%
causes relapse
 
04:38:35.929 --> 04:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the things that we we
 
04:38:38.689 --> 04:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
very much want to prevent so we're
 
04:38:40.970 --> 04:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
hoping that you understand that we're
 
04:38:42.410 --> 04:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
not looking to be Mental Health
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
Counselors we're looking to be
 
04:38:48.410 --> 04:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
co-occurring disorders counselors to
 
04:38:51.051 --> 04:38:51.061 align:start position:0%
continue that identity I get asked by
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors all the time
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
why don't you just be a mental health
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
counselor and the reality is folks with
 
04:38:58.910 --> 04:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
co-occurring disorders with substance
 
04:39:01.010 --> 04:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
use are looking for someone they know
 
04:39:04.250 --> 04:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
have expertise in how to to treat the
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
whole person holistically and uh if we
 
04:39:11.570 --> 04:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
if we did and honestly if I were
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
interested in treating mental health
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
that stood alone and not the whole
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
person then why would I not only get all
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
of the education that allows me to be
 
04:39:25.970 --> 04:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
the licsw that I also am
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then an additional 300 hours uh of a
 
04:39:32.810 --> 04:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
co-occurring disorder specific education
 
04:39:35.689 --> 04:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
and an additional eight hours
 
04:39:38.270 --> 04:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
for every two years for every licensing
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
