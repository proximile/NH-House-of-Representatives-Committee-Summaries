we go
 
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
through so for those of you on slide one
 
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
for the oh I guess it's slide
 
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
two this may sound basic information but
 
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
if you're not familiar the university
 
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
system is made up of three institutions
 
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire Kean
 
00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
State College pulou State University in
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh this past fall we had a total of
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
enrollment of 23,000 students 8 3% of
 
00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
those are undergraduates about
 
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
19,000 um UNH makes up 69% of that total
 
00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment with Keen at 14 and Plymouth
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
at 17 our total operating expenses in
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 were $928 million about
 
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
20% of that is research primarily
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
Federal research and the research
 
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
Enterprise at the University of New
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has grown 75 % since fiscal n
 
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 19 um UNH is only one of 146
 
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
universities in the country that's
 
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
delegate uh uh classified as an R1
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
institution in the Carnegie Carnegie
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
classification which means it's it's
 
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.629 align:start position:0%
classification which means it's it's
high

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
research on the next slide slide three
 
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
um provide some information hopefully to
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
um leave you with what a tremendous
 
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
asset the university system and frankly
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
the community college system also are to
 
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
the state um in delivering public higher
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
education to the citizenry we um at the
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
University system graduate about
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
3,000 folks well 3,000 folks enter the
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Workforce every year and
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'll point out that there's a difference
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
between the 3,000 in this deck and the
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
2,000 you heard at the education funding
 
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.590 align:start position:0%
2,000 you heard at the education funding
committee

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
because um in in thinking through the
 
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
impact we really need to in include
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
graduate and above
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
um um folks that are entering the
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
workforce so the 2,000 that I had in the
 
00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
deck uh at when we last met was only
 
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
undergrad this is um graduate bachelor's
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
and an advanced degrees the university
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
system has a $3.7 billion economic
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
impact um on the state and we work with
 
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
thousands of businesses across the state
 
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.189 align:start position:0%
thousands of businesses across the state
on

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
internships um businesses are engaged to
 
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
inform curriculum with faculty to think
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
about the future needs maybe not we we
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
can't pivot quite as quickly as the
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
community college system can but we work
 
00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
with businesses to think about what's
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
the long-term need in our state for
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce um the um you're probably
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
likely aware of the Cooperative
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
Extension that's a un through UNH it has
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
reach across the entire state in so many
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
areas and and Plymouth State and Keen
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
State also very deeply embedded in the
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
regions um in the Mano region the Lakes
 
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
Region North Country the next slide and
 
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
this was this came up when we met with
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
education funding committee this this is
 
00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
a slide that my board's education
 
00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
Excellence committee reviews at each
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
meeting it's a state in agenda item and
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
um we look at the top occupations
 
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
according to New Hamshire Employment
 
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
Security over a 10-year period and we
 
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
align those occupations with making sure
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
that our institutions C have those
 
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
degrees and so that's what you'll see on
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
The Bachelor front and the Masters and
 
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
the doctorate the top occupations
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
according to Employment Security and
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
where are institu tion programming lines
 
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
those this this next slide on slide six
 
00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
also was
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
um was asked at the education um funding
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
committee and it relates to New
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident students and
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
nonresident students and how those
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
graduates impact our Workforce I
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned about 3,00 about 3,000 of our
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
graduates enter the New Hampshire
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce each year about 80% of our New
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident graduates stay and
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
work in the state about 20% of our
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
non-resident students stay and work in
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
the state and that is based on we have
 
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
an agreement with again Employment
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
Security no Hampshire employment
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
security and we share data so that we
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
can see periodically whether or not our
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
students are working in the state and
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's not student specific that
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
concerns do you mind taking questions
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
the middle all not at all repres thank
 
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for being
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
here and for taking questions I'll try
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
to hold most of my questions to the end
 
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
to allow the flow to go on but just
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
looking at what's written down versus
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
what you said I'm a bit confused
 
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
confused because what I wrote in my
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
notes when I was listening to you was
 
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
that 80% of the New Hampshire students
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
stay in the state and 20% of the out of
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
state students stay in the state the
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
bottom says that out of the people Who's
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
Who start working in New Hampshire 80%
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
were living in New Hampshire and 20%
 
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
were non-resident you know there is a
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
slight difference between those two
 
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
numbers you don't need to tell me right
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
now which is which but if you could
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
maybe clarify at a later point cuz if
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers of students that come in are
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
equal there wouldn't be any difference
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
but if we have you know more of a Kind
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
coming in the percentages would skew I
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to go too deeply into the
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
weeds right now I will follow up with
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
you later if you'd like me to clarify a
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
representative so on slide seven where
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
where does the state investment go in
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 uh the state invested $95
 
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
million in the University
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
system about $81 million of that
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
95 buys down instate New Hampshire
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
resident instate tuition and about 14
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
million is allocated to statutory
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
programs such as Cooperative Extension
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
agricultural experiment station this is
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
another place
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
where it's about
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
$7,300 per new Hampshire student this
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
fiscal year is the state subsidy that 81
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
million now when you when I met with you
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
at education funding I had a number of
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
6,900 in there but the more I thought
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
about it the
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
6900 is based on headcount the number of
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
actual bodies where I think full-time
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
equivalent is a better measure
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
to think about the state subsidy and
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
because this includes graduate
 
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
students um AR undergraduate students
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
for the most part is are
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
full-time students except uh the College
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
of professional studies the former
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
granted State College um that being said
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
again it's
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
$7,300 per New Hampshire student is the
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:28.839 align:start position:0%
subsidy the other uh piece that's not
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
included uded in this 95 million that
 
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
the university system funds on its own
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
are the um National Guard tuition
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
waivers the statutory program and to a
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
much lesser extent there's a foster
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
child tuition waiver as well and that
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
approximates about a 2 half million
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
dollar per year for National Garden and
 
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.509 align:start position:0%
dollar per year for National Garden and
those

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
programs on slide eight again this comes
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
out of conversations with the education
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
funding committee
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
so $95 million appropriation about 14
 
00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
million of that is for our statutory
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
programs and that breaks down to the
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
well it's seven I had 7,300 on the prior
 
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.990 align:start position:0%
well it's seven I had 7,300 on the prior
slide

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
7257 right per
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
student New
 
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire net tuition not fees but and
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
this is on average New Hampshire
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
students net tuition that they pay is
 
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.230 align:start position:0%
students net tuition that they pay is
about

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
$7,000 so if we add the state subsidy
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
with the net tuition dollars paid by a
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire student we come up with
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
14,300 the
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
net tuition paid by non-resident
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
students is
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
16,600 again all on average so we have a
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
differential there right of
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
$2,300 so there's
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
more Revenue if you will and it's not a
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
surprise with non-resident students what
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
is your published tuition right the
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
published tuition rate for um UNH is I
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
knew you were going to ask that so I
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
brought all of this with me the at UNH
 
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
brought all of this with me the at UNH
it's

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
36,700 for an outof State
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
resident and again that's and that makes
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
sense when we look at the state is
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
picking up about half the
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
cost the state's investment is funding
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
half the
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
cost of a New Hampshire student that's
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
what the investment is funding and the
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
KE in Plymouth State yes yes so at
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
and at
 
00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:10.310 align:start position:0%
and at
keen

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
11,754 and out of state is
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
23810 and I have a slide coming in a
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
little bit will show
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
you how our tuition both instate and out
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
of state Stacks up against some other
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
New England public
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
peers it's the next one
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
yep before you go on and what would
 
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
housing cost be typically for okay an on
 
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.670 align:start position:0%
housing cost be typically for okay an on
campus

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
housing housing for a double room at UNH
 
00:14:45.959 --> 00:14:48.629 align:start position:0%
housing housing for a double room at UNH
is

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
5100 you one more time um would it would
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
it be helpful if I
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
broke this down for you and sent it to
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
you on one document with housing and
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
fees and sure I'm happy to do that if
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
okay so um on slide nine the this shows
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
for UNH Plymouth and
 
00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:26.839 align:start position:0%
Kean how tuition instate tuition has
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
grown since on a percentage basis since
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 in each at each of those
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
institutions so you'll see
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
Yukon has increased its tuition
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
22% in
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
state um now you'll see UNH Plymouth and
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
keen and again because of St um
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
increased State support we've held been
 
00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
able to hold tuition flat um over this
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
period now unfortunately you will see
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
that even though we've been holding
 
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
tuition flat I Plymouth and Kean are
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
still this is tuition and fees right
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
tuition so what's included in fees oh
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
um Recreation fees athletic fees um you
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
could have student organization fees and
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
and when the board sets those fees it's
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
with student input there's a process on
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
all of the campuses where student
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
organizations Student Government meet
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
with um leaders on the campus to talk
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
about what those fees should be so it is
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
um but they're but they're not
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
insignificant that's why we include them
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
with um here with tuition and fees so
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
again Plymouth and
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
Kean highest instate tuition of it of
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
these peers other New England Regional
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
publics and but
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
Yukon you UNH no longer has the
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
distinction of having the highest
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees around Yukon now has
 
00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:11.750 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees around Yukon now has
that

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
distinction can you explain what those
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
there's obviously three different
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
categories of college institutions there
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
what is the distinction that's being
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
made between the three charts so um we
 
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.189 align:start position:0%
made between the three charts so um we
often

00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
um get Pete right met have a set of
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
peers so you'll see unh's peers are all
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
the flagships in New England which are
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
biggest competitors where Western
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Westfield Framingham those
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
are State um universities smaller
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
regional state universities in
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Connecticut and so that
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
would be a p Plymouth pier and
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
um Keen State again smaller maybe more
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
liberal arts focused public in other New
 
00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.390 align:start position:0%
liberal arts focused public in other New
England

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
England
 
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.230 align:start position:0%
England
States

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
Representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
you again
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
um we were talking about you know the
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
fact that pretty much half of our
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
tuition base tuition is covered by the
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
state and therefore is not meaningful to
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
the student themselves it's the
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that shoulder the burden do
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
the other universities that you compare
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
you AG with have similar programs and
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
would you have a comparison of what the
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
C to the student are rather than the
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
revenues of the University um not
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily on the spot but yeah yes
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
because I understand that right now we
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
are looking at your Revenue right now
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
from all sources but it may also be
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
meaningful to understand the cost that
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
the student sees when they you know come
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
and join so the well I will say that
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
um so these are the ER prices right of
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
instate tuition instate tuition and fees
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I don't believe we're going
 
00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
to have readily ready access to the
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
discounting that that the other states
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
um are doing in relation to
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
to I don't think that's available um I
 
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.310 align:start position:0%
to I don't think that's available um I
will

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
say that our surrounding states though
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
do invest more heavily in public higher
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
ed than than New Hampshire does but um
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
well maybe Vermont might be a tie with
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
so I would guess I shouldn't this is
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous I shouldn't guess
 
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.070 align:start position:0%
dangerous I shouldn't guess
[Music]

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm going to guess that many of
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
these comparator institutions
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
the cost to
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
deliver the education is likely higher
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
than than um at the University system
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to guess that because
 
00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:12.630 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to guess that because
they

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
have much more State
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
support and their tuition and fees
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
aren't I mean they're they're lower than
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
ours on Plymouth and Kean but not
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
similarly on the next slide uh we did
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing for out of state tuition
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
in fees and um we have not kept out of
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
state tuition and fees flat um we've
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
been increasing out of state tuition and
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
fees about 2 and a half% per year um and
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see that so
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
so the tuition and fees for out of state
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
for UNH Plymouth and Keen have
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
been pretty much um comparable with
 
00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.270 align:start position:0%
been pretty much um comparable with
their

00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
peers except um Connecticut has been
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
having some um significant changes with
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
its tuition at at its Regional campuses
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
but again Plymouth and
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
Kean are highest sticker prices for um
 
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
peers so on slide 11 not
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
withstanding all of that um because the
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
university system with um State support
 
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
has kept tuition flat for I think this
 
00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
is our fifth year running um and at the
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
same time increased financial aid for
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students the net tuition
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
and fees for our New Hampshire students
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
has actually dropped since 2020 from
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
from 10,500 to 9,800 and again that's
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
on the next slide um for the first time
 
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.549 align:start position:0%
on the next slide um for the first time
since

00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
2013 our New Hampshire enrollment
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
increased this fall and
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
um I I like to think it's because of
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
keeping tuition
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
um holding tuition um and the
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
competition is getting very very stiff
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
right across New England with well the
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
next slide will show
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
you so we our enrollment has has fallen
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
14% since fiscal
 
00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:44.269 align:start position:0%
14% since fiscal
19

00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
19
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
and much of it is because of the
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
demographics there are fewer fewer
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
students there are fewer high school
 
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
students I'm sure you um are aware of
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
that with working with
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
K12 but it's not just New Hampshire I
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
mean New Hampshire is um I
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
think feeling it um more deeply than our
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
surrounding New England states but it's
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
the fact in all our surrounding
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
states the demographics there are fewer
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
young people so the competition is
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
heating up States want to keep their
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
young talent in state and so um
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
so you know we we could lose Mar we have
 
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
lost market share as as other states
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
double down and and um try to keep their
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
students in state that being said
 
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
projections show that it's going to get
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
worse so on slide 13 you'll see and this
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
is a um Nathan Gro he's a he's a faculty
 
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
member I think maybe in Connecticut who
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
does the these projections for public uh
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
College goers and we haven't hit the
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
bottom the the pipe P line continues to
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
shrink so before you move on but can you
 
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
explain what happens after
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
29 well you'll see they the numbers well
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
they go back up they start to tick up I
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
I get yes I can read the graph why a
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
births so what you're saying is the
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
birth rates are improving now they
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
so what are we doing about
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
it we
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
um we need to think boldly and act and I
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
will say
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's not just about the health of
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
the University system it's about the
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
ensuring we can deliver on our mission
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
and be a significant driver of a high
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
quality Workforce into the future I was
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
at a business R participated in a
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
business r round table last week and um
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's obvious that workfor you know
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing Child Care those are
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
the three big issues that that our state
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
is tackling and and um so as the as the
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
number of young people
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
declines um we need to continue to make
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
sure we can deliver on our mission for
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce and Innovation and things like
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
that for the future of the state that
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
being said so
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
over a 5-year period when inflation Rose
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
23% our employee comp increased
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
2% I'm going to put a qualifier in that
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
non-grant compensation I don't include
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
grants because I told you that the the
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
grant the research portfolio increased
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
75% over a 5-year period so that you
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
have more employees there so I take out
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
the grants and um we've had had we've
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
reduced our full-time employees by
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
5.4% and our parttime employees by 19%
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
since since
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
2019 we've reduced our employer
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
contributions for retirement we are not
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire retirement
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
system the university system is a
 
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
separate 501c3 so we're not considered
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
state employees we're not um in the
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh we we've reduced
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
our medical plan benefits increasing
 
00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:32.190 align:start position:0%
our medical plan benefits increasing
employee

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
premiums we are selling and demolishing
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
buildings we have fewer students
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
we can have a smaller footprint we're
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
exiting least spaces actually one of the
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
least spaces we are exiting is the
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
office my the system office here in
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
conquer and we are moving to New
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Technical Institute so we're
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Rubenstein found a little
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
building near his building and we're
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
we're moving down there in the June time
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
frame and at the same time we are
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
investing in new
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
technology we went live on December 21st
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
with uh workday a new enterprise
 
00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:11.830 align:start position:0%
with uh workday a new enterprise
resource

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
resource
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
planning um system
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um we had been on what's
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
called Banner very common in highered
 
00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
for 30 years and it was not going to
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
meet our needs for the future so it's um
 
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
it's a little slowo still
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
um but but so far so
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
good um excuse me we have the university
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
system has many many Partnerships across
 
00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:44.919 align:start position:0%
the state um a significant partnership
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
with community college
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
system we um the two systems recently
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
announced a 100 Pathways have been
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
developed so that community college
 
00:27:57.519 --> 00:27:58.669 align:start position:0%
developed so that community college
system

00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
graduates can seamlessly transfer to the
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
university system and that was a lot of
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
really hard collaborative work between
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff with the community
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
to have those Pathways so if you you
 
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:15.799 align:start position:0%
know if you're a student entering the
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
community college system and you know
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
where you you're headed there are
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
advisors available and you'll know what
 
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
your pathway is and we have a direct
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
admit program so if you meet eligibility
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
requirements you have a 25 at
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
UNH you're automatically admitted so um
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
and and there's a lot going on in that
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
space and I mentioned there are a lot of
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
administrative collaborations between
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
the two systems as well um so we have I
 
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier Partnerships with
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state um strong
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
internship Partnerships and we're always
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
striving to do more with that we know
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
that out of state students are twice as
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
likely to stay and work here in New
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they've participated in an
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
internship so um again really building
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
those relationships with businesses
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
across the state um UNH was the
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
inaugural higher ed member of the New
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Life Sciences Association I'm
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
not sure if you've been um involved with
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
with um that Association but they're
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
really up and coming with it's it's
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
amazing the the life sciences businesses
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
that are here in New Hampshire and that
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
are moving to New Hampshire um and so so
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
we we
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
are very much involved with actually the
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire Life Sciences
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
was on that the business Round Table I
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.590 align:start position:0%
 
week

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
and the the other part of the our
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
mission is is um Innovation we think
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
about the future and was at a hearing
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
not too long ago in ch can Rubenstein
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned something about you know who
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
would have thought espec certainly not
 
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
when I was in college that you'd have a
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
need for for skills to 3D print
 
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
kidneys right so we in thinking about
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
the future um it's it's so important to
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
innovate and that's really part of what
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
the research Enterprise is as well but
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
it's also really partnering with
 
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
business um the John Olen Advanced
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturing center if you if you've
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
ever if you haven't heard of it or you
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
ever want to take a tour it's it's quite
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
a remarkable facility um over at UNH and
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
um high school students Community
 
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
College any students um can get hands-on
 
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.230 align:start position:0%
College any students um can get hands-on
experience

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
with the this Advanced manufacturing
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
equipment there are businesses that are
 
00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
collocated there um and again that's
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
it's part of thinking about innovation
 
00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.470 align:start position:0%
it's part of thinking about innovation
the

00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
um the other I I don't I'm not sure if
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
you're aware so in the southwest part of
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
our state over in the manad region the
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
the global
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
leader in Diamond turning equipment
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing there are about five or
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
six companies in the southwest corner of
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
our state they lead the globe on making
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
this precision diamond turning
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
equipment um and and those six companies
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
employ over a thousand people so Keen
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
state is the only four-year college that
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
americom the American Center for Optics
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturing has chosen to partner with
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
they partnered with other community
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
colleges in the country um and Mark uh
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
boomgarden the CEO of more nanotech was
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
on that round table last week and they
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
have partnered with Keen State on
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
building curriculum and equipping a lab
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
on the campus again to help with that
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
Pipeline and that
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce and um you know in the theme
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
of meeting our students where they are
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
Pou State um recently received approval
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
from Nei Nei is the acronym for the New
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
England accrediting body of all colleges
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
and universities here in New
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
England and um Plymouth applied for um
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
five programs to have three-year
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degrees and were recently
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
approved and they hope to start those
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
next fall so business administration
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
cyber security Outdoor Adventure lead
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
leadership police studies and
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
Robotics um to to again students who
 
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.029 align:start position:0%
Robotics um to to again students who
want

00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
to complete at a faster Pace maybe at a
 
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
lower cost it will be a a three-year
 
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.389 align:start position:0%
lower cost it will be a a three-year
bachelor's

00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
bachelor's
 
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative Dy no it's tough I can't
 
00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:08.919 align:start position:0%
remember my name either I have to say as
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
a former manufacturing individual who
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
owned a manufacturing facility worldwide
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
you saying that you're giving these
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
programs to
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
students cons conis you know their their
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
curriculum so that they can get out and
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
get into the businesses sooner because I
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
found in all of my time here in the
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
United here in New Hampshire
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing lacked people coming into
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
their facilities people were moving out
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
and going other places because they
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
could do better and I think that working
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
on the curriculum like you're doing now
 
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
and making a their degree shorter time
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
and focusing on this with other
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities or any business
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair that's uh one
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
question that I actually held up not to
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
interrupt the presentation I'm
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
developing my ability to not ask all the
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
time um on slide two you are mentioning
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
the one 188 millions that you are
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
spending in direct research direct
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
research spend I was curious if you
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
could provide me now or later with a
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
split between how much of that is
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
federal funding grants and what not and
 
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
how much is State funding and obviously
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
you mention here is direct expenditures
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
I would also be interested in a direct
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
versus indirect you know split whenever
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
time allows those are not the exact
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
numbers I'm expecting you to have right
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
now but if you could follow up 100%
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you yes I I can tell
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
you though I think
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
so um the
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
year and we'll get the the breakout
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
almost all of it is FAL but we will
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
definitely get the breakout for you
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
Waller uh thank you chairman uh thank
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
you uh my friend uh I'm not surprised
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
that uh having watched these
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
presentations from several of your
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
predecessors that chers is much more
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
thorough and much more given to the
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
numbers which given your background in
 
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
finances giving you that Advantage I'm
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
wondering on page
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
11 what enabled you
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
um what caused there to be le less net
 
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.069 align:start position:0%
um what caused there to be le less net
tuition

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh what were enable you to get it
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
reduced so so
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
um this is average per student so the
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
price didn't go up yeah but you've got
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
more help but there's more financial
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
aid so it could be from the financial
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
aid could be from institutional sources
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
it I I'll give you another example um
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
annual you'll be very familiar with this
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
the college savings
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
tuition um
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
529s yes but representative wer and I
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
sit on the uh advisory commission and we
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
flipped that y two or three years ago so
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
that more dollars are going directly to
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
the institutions we also
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
um I think it was before 2020 but um the
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
university system now has the granite
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
guarantee program where needy New
 
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students pel eligible
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
students um will cover their
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
tuition but it's a last dollar
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship so as annual scholarships
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
from the 529 increase right that can
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
fill some of that Gap as well um so it's
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
from a number of sources philanthropic
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
sources institutional
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
sources um but more financial aid per
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
student yep has been
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
awarded over that fiveyear time foure
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
time period has the endowment
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
grown the endowment has
 
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.510 align:start position:0%
grown the endowment has
grown

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
grown
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
um well we've
 
00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
had some good
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
returns um um
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
philanthropy yes it's growing but I
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
think that that the um the returns that
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
we've enjoyed have
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
helped with grow the endowment as well
 
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.990 align:start position:0%
helped with grow the endowment as well
thank

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray got it got it
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chairman
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
er a couple things that maybe string
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
together um around the faculty reduction
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
um and the staff reduction um I assume
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
can you speak a little bit to how much
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
that people who are leaving as opposed
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
to people who are retiring and if that
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
is tied to any programs that have been
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
reduced as well courses that students
 
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
are missing and if I can just go a
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
little bit further before I carry on
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
with some of this others how you
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
perceive that um impacting quality of
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
Education um just as an aside one of the
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
things that if you haven't been to the
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
Olsson Center it is fabulous I was blown
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
away that they're 3D producing live
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
Coral I don't even know how
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
I don't even know how that makes sense
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
to me and that they're also doing these
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
giant things so you can do onsite
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
repairs for submarines and just from the
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
little Coral to these it's a remarkable
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
Center so if you have a chance to visit
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
it it's it's a great program but any to
 
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
my question can you kind of Link The
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
Faculty reduction loss of jobs quality
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
loss of programs and a little narrative
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
around that thank you um so I would I
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
will argue that we're there's not a loss
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
of quality um as we have fewer
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
students um we don't need as many staff
 
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.670 align:start position:0%
students um we don't need as many staff
and

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
faculty um the
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
and actually it's not it's not unusual
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
to end a program or start a new program
 
00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:22.839 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:39:22.839 --> 00:39:24.390 align:start position:0%
based on
need

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
um so in 20
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
2020 I think it was in the middle of
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
covid um the university system invested
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
in an early retirement program because
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
we knew this was coming this isn't a
 
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.390 align:start position:0%
we knew this was coming this isn't a
secret

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
secret
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
it's these folks were born 18 years ago
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
or 19 years ago so it was it was um a
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
strategic move the
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
the many more took the early retirement
 
00:39:59.790 --> 00:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
program than we had estimated would take
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
it so we did have to backfill I think
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
almost 500 people took advantage of that
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
early retirement program so we did have
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
to backfill some some of those positions
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
um but I would say no loss of quality um
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
we have you know the
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
highest graduation rate of any New
 
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
England public and and pride ourselves
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
on on that we have very high retention
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
rates um we could always do better but
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
the most expensive college degree is the
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
one you don't finish so it's important
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
to to everyone across the university
 
00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:43.030 align:start position:0%
to to everyone across the university
system

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
to support our students and retain them
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and graduate timely so and
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
and representative honestly as we look
 
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
forward we're going to have to make
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
additional reductions
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
because as enrollment
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
declines we can't stand still
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
and because of the market competition I
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
spoke of
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
earlier the market won't bear big price
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
increases so it's not well enrollment is
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
declining so we'll just increase tuition
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
6% well no because that's going to
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
impact our ability to attract students
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
so um High ired is it's it's a it's a
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
tough gig it's a good thing the mission
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
second to not that's what I say to my
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
folks follow up thank you uh my other
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
question you've worked you and with the
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
community college system have worked
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
really hard to make a seamless thing get
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
from one end to the other and however
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
you know a way that helps students do
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
that when you talk about the how your
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
tuition has been reduced over the years
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of students is that reflective
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
of some students starting in the
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
community college system which is less
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
expensive before they get to the UNH
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
system um and is there can you just
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
speak if it makes sense to to speak to
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
the difference between the students cost
 
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
if they start in the community college
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
system and go through as opposed to if
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
they start at the University system and
 
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.030 align:start position:0%
they start at the University system and
go

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
through so let me try to answer the
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
first part of your question
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
first no I do not think
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
our Revenue has been detrimentally
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
impacted by closer Partnerships with the
 
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
community college
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
system I like to think that maybe we'll
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
attract students that might not have
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise tried to to go on to a
 
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.309 align:start position:0%
otherwise tried to to go on to a
bachelor's

00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
bachelor's
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
degree um
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
so but the second part of your question
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I've already forgotten well
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
fortunately I can remember part of it
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
there but thank you the way you framed
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
that I like the way that you framed the
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
first because I wasn't suggesting it
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
that um there was any detriment at all
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
but that it's an a detriment to the
 
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
university more that there's an
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
advantage to the students being able to
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
go to go through those paths um which
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
the way you answer the question I think
 
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
it sort of makes the other part of my
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
question kind of irrelevant um so I'll
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
save you on that one um I had one other
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
question if I could how's the rink can
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
you give us a narrative about the rink
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
ask that too thank you so so um it's in
 
00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:32.349 align:start position:0%
ask that too thank you so so um it's in
design

00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
phase I think it's coming to my board
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
for final
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
approval it's a it's a sizable project
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
so it needs board
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
approval I think it's coming in February
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
or March so um it's in design they're I
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
will say you know they're they're
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
working on making sure that we have the
 
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.790 align:start position:0%
working on making sure that we have the
funding

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
available um the C construction costs
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
increase so um and and so yes it's I
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
don't know what the estimated completion
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
date is but it's about ready to come to
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
the board for approval in the next month
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
or two I have one more followup maining
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
theak go ahead thank you again um you
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
have a partnership with the music hall
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
in Portsmith for the so-called Arena
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
concerts and any of those people who
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
perform there I've never heard of at
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
this point in my life um but can you
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
speak to how that partnership is a good
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
partnership how it's working with the
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
Music Hall um and how that might pertain
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
to revenue to the
 
00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:37.230 align:start position:0%
to revenue to the
university

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:40.559 align:start position:0%
the I can get I'll have to get more
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
specifics on the partnership and how it
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
came about but in the in the theme of we
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
are trying to leverage all of our assets
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
every way we can um again we have it's
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
it's an investment it's an asset so
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
um the the Music Hall is one is one part
 
00:45:01.079 --> 00:45:02.030 align:start position:0%
um the the Music Hall is one is one part
of

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you yeah no problem
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
others yes sir representative
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
papichi thank you Mr chairman um as you
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
know I was talking to you when you had
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
the previous presentation about um the
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
potential correlation between some of
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
the drops in student tuition and the uh
 
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
you know lesser number of students that
 
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079 align:start position:0%
may be attending which may allow you to
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
allocate a bit more towards the tuition
 
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
Aid just to make sure we all understand
 
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
that could we maybe have like the last
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
for the last 10 years the total amount
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
spend the university to buy down in
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
state tuition and the number of students
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
that impacted because this will kind of
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
clarify All Those Questions around that
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
particular area um just to make sure
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm getting this right you
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
maybe a trend of the are we looking for
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
the state appropriation per New
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire student over a 10 year period
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
no no no we we can do that without
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
asking you that directly right because
 
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
we have all those numbers but right now
 
00:46:10.109 --> 00:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
there is a certain amount of the state
 
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation that the university is
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
using to buy down the instate tuition I
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
just would like that number and the
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
number of students that it was allocated
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
to because that's how you got your
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
$7,300 or what 7257 on the next slide
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
right so I'd like that for the last 10
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
years to just see how it moved around
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe shed some light into you know
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
what moves it a little and of course any
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
color that you have around why the
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
changes would help us you know instead
 
00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
of guessing we' know exactly what you
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
thought at the time but it doesn't have
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
to be a big thing just just to clarify
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
that question happy too thank you so
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
much and can I request that you send all
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
your answers or questions to Mr landan
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
and so he can then distribute them to
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
the whole of course Committee of course
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
thank you no no private date
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
I representative hacken Phillips thank
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
you chair um thank you Kathy and Lauren
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
for being here today um since we are
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
finance division 2 and we are thinking
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
about the upcoming budget budget cycle
 
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you have um kind
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
of a preview for us about possibly any
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
concerns or drivers that you see as you
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
head deeper into the cycle um as as
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
we're you know moving from the
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
governor's phase of the budget to into
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
the house phase you know you know kind
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
of anything on the horizon that you're
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
worried about or um that we should be
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to hear about in the
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
future uh thank you representative um
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm deeply
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
worried um I don't
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
know I'm not sure where the governor's
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
budget um what what the governor will
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
propose in her
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
budget uh
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
the go uh former governor sonunu had
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
um asked that we um budget for a 4% cut
 
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
which took us to $91 A5
 
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
million and we model that out um we do
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
long-term Financial modeling at least
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
once a year so we had modeled that out
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
for my board strategic retreat in
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
September and it that will be painful
 
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
but we modeled it out and we're working
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
on how we're going to
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
think about the future um since then
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
we're hearing it's it could be much
 
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
worse than a 4% cut again I'm not I I
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
don't know yet what that looks like um
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
but that will require very that will
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
require deep Cuts we we're
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
um I I I pride myself in the University
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
system on we have a balanced budget we
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't run in the red but we don't run
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
big black
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
either um and so we'll we'll and and I
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
fully expect my board isn't going to say
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
well okay the
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
state had a we had a cut and so we're
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
going to run in the red we're going to
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
have to figure that out so frankly I'm
 
00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
concerned then I'll ask you a question
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh this it goes back to the historical
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
so in the last hb2 the state provided $3
 
00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
million and UNH balance matched it with3
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
million dollar for PSNH and U Kean could
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
you uh PSU I mean and Kean Could you um
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
tell us what what happened with that
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
money what was for the the
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
um it gave Plymouth and
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
Kean uh a little bit of cushion to act
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
to get the budget their budgets
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
balanced and it worked so Kean had been
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
running in the red
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
for six or seven
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
years and um they're breaking even now
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
even without the additional dollars in
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 it provided that
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
cushion um so and you know I would I
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
would as I think about the upcoming by
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
enum if there was any opportunity for a
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
step down of a reduction we know we have
 
00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.670 align:start position:0%
step down of a reduction we know we have
to

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
act with urgency and boldly but if there
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
was any kind of a step down that might
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
help give us some Runway the fiscal year
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
starts in five
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
months so um anyway that that one
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
time kicker if you will for Plymouth and
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
Kean did what it was intended Ed to do
 
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
give them some Runway to make changes
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
to to get to a a better
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
spot and can I ask that you um provide
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
us with a more detailed version of your
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
budget your overall budget
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
questions anything else you want to just
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
I usually like to end with just could
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
you I want to make sure I we have down
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
everything we want you want us to bring
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
back to you so Lauren if you could run
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
just so we're we're not missing anything
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
these are my notes to send to Mr Lander
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
again um a breakdown of housing fees
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
tuition out of state and in state for
 
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.190 align:start position:0%
tuition out of state and in state for
each

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.069 align:start position:0%
each
institution

00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
institution
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
um uh information about musical
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with UNH I think we talked
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
about that briefly uh last 10 years
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
total number uh buy down that the um
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
between usnh and New Hampshire State
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
dollars including student count too you
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to and then detailed version of
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh the usnh
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
budget what I
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
got am I missing
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
anything there one more representative
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
Pap papichi there was that um early
 
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
request for U the 188 millions in direct
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
research spend the split between federal
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
and state funding and ideally both in
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
direct and indirect cost splits the same
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
split the same way
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
um we were able to get the 34 million
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
for the total indirect but a breakdown
 
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
would be very appreciated thank you
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
certainly and and we'll F I'll follow up

introduce

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
yourselves thank thank you very much
 
01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
representative her and members of the
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee Mark Rubenstein Chancellor of
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
the community college
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
system good afternoon Shannon Reed
 
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
director of government Affairs for the
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
community college system and briefly I
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
just want to explain the the two
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
materials you have before you the slide
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
deck is you'll notice dated November of
 
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
2024 this was our presentation to the
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
governor's panel and since it was
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
already part of the LBA budget documents
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
we thought just in the interest of not
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
presenting you with too many very
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
similar versions of the same thing we
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
would we would go with this but we can
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
certainly talk through anything that has
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
um that has been asked or has come up in
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
conversations since uh since last
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
November and then the second the second
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
document just the two-pager um is very
 
01:00:59.029 --> 01:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
specific to one area of our work which
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
is um Workforce training and
 
01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with businesses and even
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
more specifically a result of specific
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
funding that the legislature included in
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
the community college systems budget
 
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
last time around that we want to show
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
you impacts to date and and make a case
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
funding thank thank you um I'm going to
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
spend most of my time on just the second
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
page of the handout and so it'll save
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of page flipping just
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
for background our our mission and you
 
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to look at this it's on the
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
fourth slide it had succinctly stated
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
it's to create opportunities for
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire that align
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
with the needs of the
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
state and to do it in ways that are
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
accessible and affordable and deliver
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
high quality programs simply put so
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
referring back to the second slide a
 
01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
couple of things that you'll discern
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
from that is a Statewide map the
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a presence in every region
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
of the state by Design and it's
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
complemented by the fact that now about
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
a third of our well 30% of our core
 
01:02:16.829 --> 01:02:16.839 align:start position:0%
instruction is delivered virtually it's
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
online so in theory you would say place
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter but Place actually does
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
matter a great deal and a lot of what we
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
do is Hands-On on and directly engaging
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
students in every corner of New
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in ways that align with the
 
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities that exist in those
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
communities as you'll see 93% of our
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
students are from New Hampshire and i'
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
I've said before in similar settings
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
that if you think about that other 7%
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
significantly the Upper Valley near
 
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
Vermont Coastal main if you will or in
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
Inland main I I guess it would be uh
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
whether the Sea Coast or the North
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
Country and and even the northern edge
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts that spills into where
 
01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:04.039 align:start position:0%
NASA is we are serving primarily New
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and the New
 
01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.710 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and the New
Hampshire

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce and our efforts to serve that
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
population are
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
lifelong we spent a little time earlier
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
as you were hearing from Chancellor
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
prenter talking about demographics and I
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
fully understand the concern we see
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
fewer students coming out of New
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High Schools too but if you
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
accept the premise that learning is
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
lifelong and that students over the
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
course of a 50 or 60e working life will
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
have to find ways to remain current and
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
engaged then we need to be able to serve
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
students throughout that
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
span and so you'll see on this first uh
 
01:03:47.549 --> 01:03:47.559 align:start position:0%
Slide the ways in which we do that early
 
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
college serving students whether in
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
their high schools on our campuses or
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
online is a significant part of the work
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we do last year we served over
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
10,000 students here in New Hampshire
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
they pursued 54,000 credits their
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
ability to do that was largely free of
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
cost well I shouldn't say that free of
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
charge to the students and their
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
families because the legislature
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
invested $2.5 million in the banum each
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
year the bium for us to underwrite the
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
cost of doing that those 54,000 credits
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
if those students had paid at our
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
tuition and fee rates would have caus
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
cost about 1 $13
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
million so the return on investment for
 
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
$2.5 million from the
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
state formidable return on investment I
 
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
don't know where else you find that but
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's just the financial piece the real
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
impact for students and
 
01:04:45.269 --> 01:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
families represent Murray had asked the
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
question earlier about the cost of an
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
education if you have a student who
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't just taken one or two courses but
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
has completed a semester or a year or an
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
associate degree through this program
 
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
that's a year of tuition and fees living
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
expenses that's a year of debt that they
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to take out that's a year
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
sooner into the workforce beginning to
 
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
see a return on that investment both for
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
the student and family but also for the
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
state so that that investment the state
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
has made we think is significant I I
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
should mention last year that 54,000
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
credits that's about a 15%
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
year-over-year increase
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
and that has been a steady
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
climb and in the current year although
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
the pace of growth has slowed with a
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
with a larger base to work with the in
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
the fall we saw about an 8% increase
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
right now in the spring running about
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
11% ahead of where we were last year so
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
we expect year-over-year probably
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 10% probably close to
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
60,000 credits again going back to the
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
math the same $2.5 million that the
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
state has invested for return
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
significantly above and that $13 million
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
in tuition and fee savings that I
 
01:06:04.269 --> 01:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
described is at our tuition rate $ 215
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
ACC credit $25 enrollment fee you
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
translate that to a semester at a public
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
Institution for your institution or at a
 
01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:13.670 align:start position:0%
Institution for your institution or at a
private

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
institution and I'm not suggesting that
 
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
every program and every student will
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
benefit in the same way but the
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
opportunities are are really Broad and
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
and impactful for students and families
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
and and for the state
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
so those 10,000 students that we serve
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
through our early college
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
programs about 40% of our enrollment we
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
also had between 11, 52,000 students on
 
01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
our campuses and I I'll use on our
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
campuses a little bit figuratively as I
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
said earlier a significant portion of
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
that is actually occurring
 
01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.870 align:start position:0%
that is actually occurring
online

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
and one of the things to understand
 
01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
about our students that is somewhat
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
different than the university system is
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
is who our students are 40% are 25 and
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
older 2/3 are part-time students the
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
majority of them are working while
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
they're in school and school is is part
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
of their life but not all of their life
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
and in that regard you we sometimes talk
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
about 2E and four-year institutions most
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
of our students are not 2-year and
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
fouryear students most of our students
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
are going to be four and five and sixe
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
students to get the two-year degree
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
completed and it's not always a linear
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh journey and and going in One
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
Direction I've shared in previous
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
hearings one in five of our nursing
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
students already holds a bachelor's
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
degree in some other field but they've
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
come back to see us for an associate
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
degree in nursing because that's what
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
they want to do that's what they need to
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
do and because so many of those students
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
already anchored in their communities
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
one of the Returns on investment to the
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
state in our programs is that those are
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
students who stay there and two years
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
ago the I I don't last year's numbers
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
two years ago the graduating class of
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
nursing students at White Mountains
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
community College in Berlin 26 students
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
22 by graduation already accepted jobs
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
north of The Notches those are students
 
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
who are staying local because their
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
lives are local their families are local
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
so the ability to connect students with
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities in places that matter to
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
them and matter to the state is part of
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
the work I should mention a couple of
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
other things one about 265 graduates of
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
our nursing programs last year that's
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
for the RN program an additional 57 LPN
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
graduates countless number of licensed
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants medical assistant and
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
my colleague Chris Dudley will talk a
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more about that shortly um so
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
again helping to meet a critical need
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
that the state has and partnering with
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh stakeholders throughout the
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire to ensure
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
that we can meet those needs so that's
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
the second group of students in addition
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
to the early college students the more
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
traditional non-traditional students the
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
Third group that we serve about 2500
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
students in various Workforce programs
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
and that can be anything from uh a a
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
short-term you know four six week
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
training program uh some of our boot
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
camps we've got a microelectronics boot
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
camp de developed in partnership with
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
BAE systems for very specific work that
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
they need soldering boot camps welding
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
boot camps things that are very Hands-On
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
none of this can really work online um
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
these are typ speically for working
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
adults but sometimes younger working
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
adults who need an opportunity that
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't lend itself to two or 3 years of
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
Education and Training they need a job
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
today coupled with our apprenticeship
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
programs where you're earning while
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
you're learning we have ways to help
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
students to be in the workforce as
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
they're gaining the additional skills
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
and a foundation that allows them to
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
grow and a lot of these programs even
 
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
though it's a short-term program and
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's foundational it becomes the Bedrock
 
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
on which they can build uh agree over
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
time to grow in in various career Fields
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm going to uh stop for a moment
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
and just uh see if there's anything that
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
I've said that has prompted questions
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
and if not then I'm going to invite my
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
colleague Chris Dudley to join me to
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit more in detail about
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
the work that she and colleagues do on
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
the uh career focused Workforce
 
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.229 align:start position:0%
the uh career focused Workforce
programs

01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative papichi
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very briefly um I have a
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
question and a tiny neat picky point but
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start with a question you
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
are mentioning that $2.5 million a year
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
that we provided in the previous budget
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
saved about $13 million worth of tuition
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
that you you know our residents would
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
have paid I'm assuming that 13 million
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
was saved by the 5 million we paid over
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
the bayum right no each year each year
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
each year oh it was question answer a
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay got it and Ely nitpicky on this uh
 
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
document the very very first accelerated
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
welding thing it's quite impossible for
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
a program with 21 students to have a 97%
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
completion rate it should be 995 if one
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
of them failed I agree it's need picky
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
but I cannot stop myself thank you I I I
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate your observation sir we
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
it is a good
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
Segway good afternoon I'm Christine
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
Dudley the director of Workforce
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
Development at Manchester Community
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
College thank you for having me um it's
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's wonderful to be here and I I
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
just want to say that um my mom served
 
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
as a state rep and also a state senator
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
for a number of years so it's nice to be
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
here and I um appreciate the opportunity
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
um so to talk a little bit about our
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
students thank you Chancellor um I'd
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
like to actually uh talk a little bit
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
because we do have some of the most
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
vulnerable students that come to us at
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
the community college system uh the
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
barriers that they have to
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
overcome um even to just come see us to
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
be interested in a program to change
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
jobs um they've got some significant
 
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
things that they're overcoming and it's
 
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
amazing that we've had the opportunity
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
to support them through some of these um
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
programs and funding that we've been
 
01:12:31.709 --> 01:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
able to give them if we take a look
 
01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
first I I actually would like to look at
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh the backside that talks a little bit
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
about our students first um 63% of our
 
01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
students in Workforce Development are 25
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
years and older so on the on the four
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
credit side it might be 40% but it's
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
63% um many of them are coming to us
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
with um jobs so uh they have families
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
they have housing concern concerns they
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
have child care concerns uh all of those
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
um things are are what we work with them
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
on so it's not just about their
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
education but it's also trying to
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
connect them to our partners um also uh
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
our students um if you look at the first
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
bullet point many of them are returning
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
so though we've had 62 52 enrollments
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
over two and a half years about 1,00 of
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
those students are returning so they've
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
they've come and done multiple classes
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
with us
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
um so and also 15% of the work that
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now is in healthcare
 
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's a significant amount of what we do
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
and of that 30% of those are apprentices
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
so they're people that are taking
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
advantage of those earn and learn
 
01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
programs where they can earn a livable
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
wage while take a training program um to
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
better support their family or the job
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
change or whatever it is that they're
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
going through at that time um so that's
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
a that's a really important percentage
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of the apprenticeship because
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
it does help to break down some of those
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
barriers that our audience sees um so th
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
those are just a few things around um
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
who our students are and we also work
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
with employers for customized training
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
so there's another section of
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
information around enrollment in classes
 
01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
that we have with um manufacturers um
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
some of our school districts um even our
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
Community Partners um you know State
 
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
departments health and human services so
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
we really support a very wide range of
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
organizations uh across lots of
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
different Industries
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
so um on the front side uh thank you
 
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
very much for the the correction we will
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
look at that data um some of the themes
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
i' I'd like to point out um we took
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
about six to nine months to um you know
 
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
from the last bium and being awarded the
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
the uh legislative funding to support
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development we've been able to
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
build some new programs expand some new
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
programs some of the themes are
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
definitely uh continue to be in
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
healthcare so as you can see uh EMT
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
training medical assistant LNA um just
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
from year uh Academic Year 22 to 23 to
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
23 24 our LNA programs increased across
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
38% so we've we've seen some really
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
significant growth in these areas and
 
01:15:30.669 --> 01:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to scale and expand
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
these programs to different areas of the
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
state that the chancellor talked about
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
earlier it's so important for our
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
students the barriers of Transportation
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
the barriers of um child care it doesn't
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
oftentimes allow someone to even take a
 
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
program if they live in NASA to come to
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester so we've really been able to
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh look at the key areas that need
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
expansion to serve those audiences and
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's been um that scalability that
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
expansion has been really critical for
 
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
us in these high demand Industries um
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing and that people want
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
to go into um and some other themes um
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
you know that have been
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
supportive that have been supported uh
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
are in the equipment infrastructure area
 
01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
I mentioned scaling scaling and
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
expanding programs um we've also been
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
able to support our students with some
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
scholarship funding in some of these
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
programs where the workforce programs
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
are not supported by pel so we often
 
01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
times have someone who is working they
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
have a full-time job it is not meeting
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
um the expenses that they need for their
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
family they would like to switch jobs in
 
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
those circumstances it's it's oftentimes
 
01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to find um an
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
organization that with the guidelines
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
that could potentially support that
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
student um for example we owe a funding
 
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
there are some very strict guidelines
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
oftentimes our students who are changing
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
jobs may not qualify for that so some of
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
the scholarship dollars that we've been
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
able to help our students with have made
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
a significant impact on their
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
life and we have some impact statements
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page um from some
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
of our students unsolicited uh who uh
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
shared with us just how much programs
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
that they've been able to take they've
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
gotten a job have really changed their
 
01:17:29.639 --> 01:17:30.870 align:start position:0%
gotten a job have really changed their
lives

01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
minute questions representative
 
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you um couple of questions
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
oh sorry thank you Mr chair a couple
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
questions is your mom Dudley no you're
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
not Dudley Dudley okay no her her name
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
is inber okay saying Dudley Dudley's a
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
good old friend
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes um can you
 
01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
add a few more words around the lack of
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
public transportation I'm glad you
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that but the do you have a
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
sense of the number of students who
 
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
can't attend classes because of that and
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
what would public transportation look
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
like to you in order you know what would
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
what do it what would it look like to be
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
successful yeah I think that here in New
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as we know we we primarily um
 
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
are a driving state so just from from
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
City to City so I think within our
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
cities our public transportation is very
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
good so we have a we have a bus that
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
comes to Manchester Community College so
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
people that are in our area are able to
 
01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
access us but if we're looking at a
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
program that we might have in Manchester
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
but the person lives in really not not
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
so far 20 minutes or so nashwa conquered
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
that person is not able to get to us um
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
across city lines really um so I think
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
that it's it's more um about having we
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
have those supports within our cities
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's when it's right over that City line
 
01:18:59.070 --> 01:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
that we're really seeing people not be
 
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
able to make those travel Arrangements
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh on a consistent basis as well I I
 
01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
hope that answered all right thank you
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
um next you mentioned um a lot of your
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
students are over 25 which is still
 
01:19:13.709 --> 01:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
pretty darn young frankly it is it is
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
but um and I know that they're coming in
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
for Advanced Training or they're you
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
know just trying to they're working
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
another job and they're trying to get
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
another degree can you speak to the
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
number of people who are that much older
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
than 25 are people who are facing career
 
01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
challenges or career changes for a
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons yes I actually think
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
I have the demographics with
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
the just take a look and see where
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
I believe I have
 
01:19:41.199 --> 01:19:45.110 align:start position:0%
I believe I have
that

01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
um and I could also send this to you but
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
we we do have students um uh that are of
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
varying ages um actually one of our
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
students in the quotes I think he was 68
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
changing jobs to a CDL to drive cdlb to
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
drive the smaller trucks um and so that
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
is an example of a stu an older student
 
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
who is changing jobs uh we've had you
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
know moms who have large families that
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
are changing jobs um so I I will look
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
for the um we do have some data on the
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
demographics I'm just it's in one of my
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
packets I'm happy to come back to that
 
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
if that's okay okay thank and one more
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes Absolut thank you I know some 68
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
year olds who shouldn't be driving at
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
all never mind driving a
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
truck he's doing well though he is he's
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
doing very well um can you foresee the
 
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
what's the state of pel Grants looking
 
01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.149 align:start position:0%
what's the state of pel Grants looking
like

01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
so I that's a very good question um as
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
of right now it has not been passed to
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
have Workforce programs short-term
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
credentialing programs be part of pel um
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where that is federally
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
right now uh but it was not p has not
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
been passed it was a proposal on the
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
table um and I believe the last I read
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
that it it has it's it's still in
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
waiting so it it would significantly
 
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
change um the funding opportunities for
 
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
students if if I may add this issue of
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
work what's called Workforce P the
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
short-term programs has been kicking
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
around in Congress for a long time
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
and it's one of the places where higher
 
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
education is changing as I said the idea
 
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
of working adults lifelong Learners
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
federal financial aid has not kept up
 
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
with that change and we've benefited a
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
good deal from weoa funding Workforce
 
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity Innovation act funding for
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
specific areas of
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity but we still need ways of
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
supporting students whose lives just
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
don't lend themselves to the the broader
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
initiatives I I'll remark also to your
 
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
question a moment ago representative
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
Murray at one level what we can provide
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
is more anecdote and we know that a lot
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
of anecdotes are not data but in some
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
ways the nature of the population that
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
we serve working adults their lives are
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
in some ways there there are themes that
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
you can find but in some ways they are
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
so unique that they just don't fit into
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
things when we talk about a program that
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
serves about a dozen students in EMT
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
training in the North country that
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
that's impactful you're not going to get
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
numbers in the hundreds or the thousands
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
in almost anything but for the impact of
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
serving a half a dozen plow drivers to
 
01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
train train for CDL ahead of a winter in
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's an impact the
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
ability to train a dozen EMTs so again
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
our efforts dispersed regionally trying
 
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
to be responsive to the very varied
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
needs of the broad mix of students we
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
serve is is trying to responsive to
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
communities other
 
01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you not not a question
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
as much as a comment and thank you Mr
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
chairman we don't always try to measure
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh stuff you know with the same type of
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
measures because we do recognize that
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes ccsnh is U like microt
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
targeting a particular n a particular
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
area and even though the impact
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide may be small overall it is a
 
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
very significant impact for that area so
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
I agree with you that it's really hard
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
to quantify some things but I would like
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
to just assure you that we are trying to
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
adjust for that and devaluate you know
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
measure the value accordingly and even
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
though sometimes it's kind of hard to
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
you well I have a couple of requests um
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
could you provide a list of the course
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
available in the Dual and concurrent
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
enrollment program and this other
 
01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
program that you were speaking to so
 
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
this this essentially a fourth program
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
you have the original Three there and
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
your opening slide kind this this is
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
really elaboration on that third area of
 
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
our work okay all right math learning
 
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
communities can you provide the annual
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
reports recent annual reports on those
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
we can do that
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
great uh what else I want to ask you
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
this a great presentation
 
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
I was actually able to plan ahead
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
because you did such a good
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
job representative F at at the risk of
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
presentation uh if if I if I could just
 
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
I'll elaborate a little bit more um I if
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
you were to go past page two in fact go
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
past Pages 10 and 11 which outline many
 
01:24:50.109 --> 01:24:50.119 align:start position:0%
of the Partnerships we have with
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
employers estate to get to Pages 12 and
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
13 12 is the efficiency budget
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
we you can see I've marked it up
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
thoroughly that's your page 12 okay
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank P page 12 is the E efficiency
 
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
budget that we submitted and the one
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
note that I'd want to draw attention to
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
on that one is that included in that
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
from the last biannual budget we
 
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
received from the legislature $1.25
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
million each year to support early
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
childhood education course
 
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason we had made that request
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
was understanding from our faculty who
 
01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
teach in that area that often there are
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
a number of Grant programs to support
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
early childhood education but they often
 
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
have very specific requirements either
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
hours of employment or which courses are
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
covered and which are not and what we
 
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
had Learned was that many students in
 
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
those programs stop when they get to the
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
chasm that's created by having to pay
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
for a course that's not covered by the
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
Grant in part because the wages in that
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
work don't necessarily justify the
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
tuition or the debt that a student would
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
take on by being able to cover those
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
costs we've been able to help more
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
students complete those programs and
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
we've got very good feedback from a lot
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders telling us that that's
 
01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
sensible so I want you to know that that
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
is part of our our base budget when we
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
think about year-over-year what
 
01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
distinguishes that because it's almost a
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
a carve out if you will there are number
 
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
of things on page 13 that are part of
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
our budget current budget from House
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
Bill two and the rationale for
 
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
requesting those was in part to be very
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
clear about what the return on
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
investment would be to the state and for
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
us to be more
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
accountable you you'll see in there a
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
request to increase duel and concurrent
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
enrollment allow us to continue to grow
 
01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
that program you'll see a request for us
 
01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
to be able to continue to freeze tuition
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
as Chancellor preventure remarked we've
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
had tuition Frozen since
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
2018 but in fact going back to 2011
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
tuition has only gone up $5 in total
 
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
over what will be 15 years at the end of
 
01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.830 align:start position:0%
over what will be 15 years at the end of
this

01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
bium against the backdrop of inflation
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
you know what that means it's only been
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
feasible because the state has continued
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
to invest in Partnership when we started
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
doing that we
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
were virtually the most expensive
 
01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
community college system in the country
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
we're still probably in the top even
 
01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
though it's been kept flat but what has
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
happened is the value of a pel grant has
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
grown over time so that now a full-time
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
student in the community college system
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
and there are some but not a lot the
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
cost of tuition and basic fees is $7,200
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
for 30 credits and a pel grant will
 
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
cover that so ideally we'd like to be
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
able to sustain the progress we've made
 
01:27:46.990 --> 01:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
in affordability but among our
 
01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
priorities that the highest priority
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
because of the value that we think it
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
confers to students and families is that
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent enrollment
 
01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
going back to a question that
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murray asked earlier
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
about the early college and or about the
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
value s the cost of a full
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
degree what Chancellor preventure and I
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
have talked about is that using Pathways
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
between our two systems but anchoring
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
them in Early College opportunities
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
really has the potential both to make
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education that much more
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
affordable for New Hampshire but also we
 
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
think to help more students find their
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
way to New Hampshire institutions the
 
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
other priority there in addition to math
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
learning communities which is is
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
valuable in its own right are the
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
workforce credential programs those are
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
the things that director Dudley was
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
describing so I just want to draw
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
attention to the specifics of our
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
panium so that's specifically this that
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
those are examples of what this has
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
funded and and more we are building a
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
systemwide Core curriculum for automated
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing and biofabrication which
 
01:28:59.070 --> 01:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
we think will ultimately be helpful for
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
the future as Chan preventure described
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
my my observations my guidance counselor
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
never told me that I'd be using a 3D
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
printer to manufacture a pancreas and
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
had I known that I might have I might
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
have chosen a different different path
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the future holds but
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
we do think that that's an important
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
industry for the future of New Hampshire
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
and we think that we should be providing
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities across the state so that
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
Core Curriculum is of the things that
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
we're working to build so that students
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire can participate
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
economy represent h p yeah thank you Mr
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you um Chancellor for
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm just wondering
 
01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
specifically about the Dual and
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
concurrent program um could you talk a
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what kind of
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
students um in their high school years
 
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
would take advantage of that program and
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
then also could you speak about um
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
like how many credits they're eligible
 
01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
for under current you know program
 
01:30:00.430 --> 01:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
requirements and then if you could also
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
just speak a little bit about the
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
potential for increasing that I think
 
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
there's a bill floating through the
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
house that would increase those credit
 
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.629 align:start position:0%
house that would increase those credit
hour

01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility um requirements so if you
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
could just elaborate thank
 
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
you try and keep all of
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
this so to to no no To Tot totally fine
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
the first question about the type of
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
student yeah originally the intent of
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
early college was to reach students who
 
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that postsecondary
 
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
education was a possibility for them and
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
and I I talking specifically when I say
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
about post-secondary education not
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
everything is four-year College not
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
everything is traditional bachelors and
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
Beyond but there's a tendency to group
 
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
those things what what has happened over
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
time is that these have become
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
alternatives to AP courses and honors
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
courses for highly motivated students
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
and in some respects although it's still
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
valuable for a student whose ambition is
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
to go to a 4-year institution to have
 
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
access to these courses but it has
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
displaced the student who was the
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
original intent the student who didn't
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
realize that they were capable of doing
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
this kind of work so our goal in growing
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities is to have more students
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
for whom postsecondary education is
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
going to be important one of our
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
significant programs auto automotive
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
technicians still requires a degree
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
increasingly the cars on the roads in
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are complex are computer
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know I don't want to say driven but
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
but are incredibly complex instruments
 
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
and require Advanced education so for
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
students who want to be able to work in
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
that field postsecondary education will
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
be meaningful the last year 30% of the
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
credits for students doing our early
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
college came through students enrolled
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
at CTE centers we think we're starting
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
to reach that group in a way that that
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
we hadn't fully reached in the past and
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
we think that's an area of growth and
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity although again for any
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
student for any family given the cost of
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
Education the opportunity to save the
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
value of a year a semester a year two
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
years of college is going to be
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
meaningful currently the limitation is
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
two courses per year so in theory a
 
01:32:27.629 --> 01:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
student in 10th 11th and 12th grade
 
01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
could complete the equivalent of six
 
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
courses at the expense of the state and
 
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
students with resources can reach into
 
01:32:37.149 --> 01:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
their pockets or their parents pockets
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
and take more the the the goal would be
 
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
to grow this I believe though that the
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that you've
 
01:32:48.189 --> 01:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
referenced is actually intended to
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
clarify a point of confusion we do have
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
some courses that the course itself is
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
an eight credit course and it creates a
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
bit of a distortion in in what the
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
intent was so I believe the legislation
 
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
that representative lad has brought
 
01:33:05.109 --> 01:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
forward in this session is to clarify
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
that each of the two courses currently
 
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
available to a student is is for credit
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
course and if I can just add to that
 
01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
there are actually two bills that are
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
currently with the house education
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
funding committee one is that one which
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
which restricts the use to courses that
 
01:33:23.109 --> 01:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
are three or four credits and then
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
there's another bill that would actually
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
fund the program which at the same level
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we're that we're asking here in
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
division 2 and I think we just W really
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
weren't sure of the pathway that
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
education funding bills would take with
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
the new committee established but I I
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
understand it this one will start there
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
here representative hacken Phils did I
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
answer all
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
three thank you I just want to be
 
01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:51.400 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative muray yeah thank
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
you again Mr chair can you cycle back to
 
01:33:56.109 --> 01:33:56.119 align:start position:0%
the successes around the nursing program
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I keep losing my space here uh but
 
01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'm mainly concerned can you just speak
 
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
to um their employment status and how
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
many of them have remained in New
 
01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how fluid is How likely
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
are nurses to move because they're not
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily the first um earner they
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
could be you know this possibly the
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
second earner um can just be you know
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
are they do the are they employed is it
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
a livable wage and do they stay here we
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
we'll have have to get more solid data
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire employment security
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
but as I shared
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
earlier M significant number of our
 
01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
nursing students one in five already has
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's degree in fact I they tend
 
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
to skew older among our students tend to
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
be stable in the communities so in that
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
regard these aren't I'm not going to say
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
none but these aren't necessarily recent
 
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
you know younger people who are going to
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
become travel nurses for instance and
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
see the world before figuring out where
 
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
they want to settle down in many cases
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
these are folks who work where they live
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
where their families are and have more
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
stability I can't say that particularly
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
in the southern part of the state that
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
there's not a pull from the labor market
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
we know there's a 22% wage premium I
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
believe for nurses in
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but there's a lot of
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
aggravation to have to drive back and
 
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
forth to Massachusetts and we we hope
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
over time that that settles itself out
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I'm glad to hear you
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
elaborate about these are not
 
01:35:28.830 --> 01:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily new students but are nurses
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
who are continuing their careers and are
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
established in their community and and
 
01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
if I could point out on slide nine of
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
the presentation the student The
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
Graduate in that picture just graduated
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
from a nursing program at Lakes Region
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
Community College and you can see him
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
there with his two sons so this is the
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
kind of student that that's more likely
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
to stay in the community where their
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
children are in school and they have
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
ties s if I may since we're talking
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
about Nursing education I never want to
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
miss the opport say 6 years in a row
 
01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
nurses in New Hampshire highest
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
firsttime enlex pass rate in the country
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
a real tribute to the nursing faculty
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
across all of our institutions
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
University system community college
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
system and others but but the quality of
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
Education our students receive
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
translates to the quality of Health Care
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
that our residents and citizens receive
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
note any else um so two last requests
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
could you provide a PDF of this and also
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
could you also provide your more detail
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
budget the ab program thank you very
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh yes of course
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
representative H PHS thank you um I just
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you an opportunity to
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
answer the same question I asked of
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
Kathy before um given that we're the
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
finance committee and we're thinking
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
about the upcoming cycle are there any
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
um concerns on the horizon that you'd
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
like us to know about in advance of um
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
receiving that eventual budget from the
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
governor um
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
I reading uh the preliminary Revenue
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
estimates that come out in the last half
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
of each month you have to be sober by
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
what the state is facing and we're
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive to that obviously we
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the level of support we've
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
had and it still doesn't stop us from
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
asking for more because we think there's
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
a return on investment to the state
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
we're also keenly aware of competing
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
pressures that this body will have to
 
01:37:31.390 --> 01:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
balance and going back to the earlier
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
discussion about the complex lives of
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
our students in many cases the other
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
places where you might choose to invest
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
will matter to them too so hard choices
 
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
for you to make I said I think our
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to deliver as much
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
quality in return for the investment you
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
