Alison NAB I'm uh represent Rockingham

12 in strata and um as some of you know
 
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
I am introducing this bill on behalf of
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
Representative Manos so um this is
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
partly her statement on behalf of HB
 
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
537 um this bill and the two bills that
 
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
follow it cover the same situation which
 
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
is shared electric meters for well and
 
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
septic pumps in residential condominiums
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
in particular some residential units in
 
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
addition to having their own individual
 
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
electric meters also share a met meter
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
with an enjoining neighbor these shared
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
meters are strict for well and septic
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
pump usage and so the purpose of these
 
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
bills is to um ensure that these meters
 
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
are build at the residential rate
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
instead of the commercial rate which is
 
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
currently the
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
situation um and the commercial rate is
 
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
higher so the effort is that they are
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
residential for residential purposes the
 
00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
water and septic and that this would
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
return them to being build as
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
residential at the residential
 
00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
rate um this was brought on behalf of
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
several condo owners in our town that
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
are concerned about this and in
 
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
particular the Vineyards which you will
 
00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
hear a resident from The Vineyards
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
shortly talk about this bill uh the
 
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners association cannot on the
 
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
advice of council change the charge this
 
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
expense back to the paired units so the
 
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 align:start position:0%
homeowners association is then forced to
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
charge this expense back to all unit
 
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
owners this is an overcharge of
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
commercial rates for residential units
 
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
but also a cost shift from shared meters
 
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
to all units as opposed to just the ones
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
impacted um it's come to the attention
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the Prime sponsor that these three
 
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
bills actually could really cover the
 
00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
same situation and could potentially be
 
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
comined into one bill and so um It's Our
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
intention to work with this committee or
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
anyone on this committee to combine them
 
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
into one bill that would cleanly solve
 
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
this problem and
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
um I think with that uh I would be
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions or I will
 
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
defer questions to other speakers
 
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.029 align:start position:0%
defer questions to other speakers
following

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
me thank
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
you I have one quick question I know
 
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
you're not the prime sponsor but uh at
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
the risk of asking uh I I do see that
 
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
down on line 16 uh they added the RSA
 
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
378 uh colon 6-a do you have any idea
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
what that says because I did a quick
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
search and couldn't find it this
 
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 align:start position:0%
morning or perhaps the next speaker
 
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
problem representative bernardy has a
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair
 
00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 align:start position:0%
um is it your understanding that that
 
00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
all shared meters are always build at
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
the commercial rate as opposed to
 
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
residential or is this unique to uh this
 
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
property um it's my understanding that
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
they are and there was a bill the last
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
term that would have addressed this
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
issue but there were concerns about the
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
extent to which it would apply to a
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
shared space pool other facilities that
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
may be would not be the same as an
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
individual homeowner would have so this
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
is to say why would a condo association
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
be charged at a commercial rate for
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
septic and water which is something
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
every homeowner needs a pool is a
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
different situation a shared you know
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
activity space is a different situation
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
so this bill tightens up what the um in
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
iteration last term was to only apply to
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
septic and water is my understanding
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and sorry do you mind um one
 
00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
other concern was this use of the term
 
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 align:start position:0%
commercial because um I think commercial
 
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
in this in this situation applies to
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
anything that's not an individual home
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
but this is for residential condos it's
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
not meant to apply to any commercial
 
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
condos that are actually condos that
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
have um that have uh True commercial
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
them see no further questions thank you
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative I will call next on Mr
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
so I agree with representative nab's
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
idea to present one bill addressing the
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
issues raised in hp37 HB 39 and hb680
 
00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea and I would support
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
that proposal I also agree with attorney
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
daario's email to the committee stating
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
that the opinion that Condominiums are
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
and I quote inherently commercial is a
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
conclusion that is and I quote again
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
inherently inaccurate and I will address

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
welcome I have one quick question
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm not as well versed in this
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
subject as as you are
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh you're from stratum I am have you
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
canvased the rest of the state with
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
other condo associations to see if uh if
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
they're running the same type of um
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
feeling you know that's a very
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
interesting question I asked the
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
consumer Bureau of of uh protection as
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're required to keep a list of all
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
residential Condominiums are supposed to
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
file with them so I asked them to send
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
me a list and they said they do not have
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
such a list so the answer is no I have
 
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.550 align:start position:0%
such a list so the answer is no I have
not

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
canvas uh the other associations because
 
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't know how to recognize them if
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
if the consumer Bureau of protection had
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you um I just
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
was wondering do most
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
condominium unit um associations don't
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
they have an
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
office and that would be commercial
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it how would they differentiate
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
between the
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
office commercial part and the
 
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
residential Parts well in our particular
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association we do not have
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
great North management company and that
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
company serves as the manager of our
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association and if people
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.470 align:start position:0%
have complaints they would go to the
management

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%

owned by a corporation
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
managed by an uh a Condominium
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
Association is formed by
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
356b we can remain incorporated or
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
unincorporated some Condominiums
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
associations decide to become
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
Incorporated they become Incorporated
 
00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
2922 to they get registered with the New
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Secretary of State in their
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose they say they're
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
for the welfare or the benefits of the
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
condominium so some some can be
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
Corporation but they are nonprofit
 
00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:33.079 align:start position:0%
corporations and I did speak to an
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
attorney at the consumer Bureau of
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
protection who basically said under that
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
statute you can be a residential
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
condominium okay so those incorporations
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
are nonprofit yes okay thank you thank
 
00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:47.150 align:start position:0%
are nonprofit yes okay thank you thank
you

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
Mr yes I I'll have a question to for my
 
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
understanding to clarify what I think I
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
just heard was that it depends on how
 
00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
condo associations are have labeled
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
themselves with the Secretary of State
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
might determine whether they're
 
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
considered residential or commercial is
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
was that what you were
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
saying um that I would say this that you
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
go back to the condominium declaration
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
and the and the Declaration of intent in
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the condomini Declaration would say
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
whether you're commercial or whether you
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
are residential now as I said
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
Condominiums can remain unin inated
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
under 356b the Condominium Act or they
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
can become Incorporated under
 
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
2922 uh many attorneys recommend that
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
condominium associations especially
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
residential condominium associations do
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
not become Incorporated they should
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
remain under 356b as the Condominium Act
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
so uh really I would say the basic
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
document that would decide whether a
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
condominium is residential or commercial
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
is a condominium declaration
 
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.470 align:start position:0%
is a condominium declaration

neutral on House Bill 537 but we do have
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill as introduced um
 
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill requires
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
declarations for every condominium to
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
include a description or delineation of
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
The Limited common areas if any showing
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
or designating the unit or units to
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
which each is assigned and whether any
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
commercial or business enterprises are
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
permitted section two of the bill
 
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
requires that condominium associations
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
do not permit uh commercial or business
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
enterprises shall be charged the same
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
electric rate as condominium residential
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
units for domestic septic and well pump
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
electric usage in section three as our
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bill requires that
 
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
section two also be applied to um R
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
rural uh electric cooperatives for which
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
a certificate of deregulation is on file
 
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
with the Public Utilities

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
have common areas or joint used
 
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
facilities served by an electric meter
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
or meters electric service to common
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
benefit beyond that provided to an
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
individual home or residence the use of
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
electricity in those common areas or
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
facilities is not residential in nature
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
and that service provided is
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately classified as
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
non-residential New Hampshire's Electric
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
utilities classify Service as commercial
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
or residential with different rate
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
options available within each broad rate
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
class and House Bill 537 would permit
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
conduit associations across the state to
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
delineate their limited common areas and
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
determine whether any commercial or
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
business Enterprises are permitted in
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
those areas an electric utility would be
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
required to provide service under its
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
residential rates to any common areas
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
that do not have any business or
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprises the part
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
department believes this bill is
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
introduced has several unintended
 
00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
consequences the bill permits condo
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
associations which are commercial ENT
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
entities uh which I can address
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
afterwards to determine whether business
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
or commercial Enterprises take place in
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
common areas of their property as a
 
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
result condo associations rather than
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
the electric utility would have the
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
authority to determine the rate
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry there should be no
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
interruption well during
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
testimony wait till after testimony
 
00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
please well but my comment is could you
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
please speak just a tiny bit slower
 
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
that's all yes a question to the chair
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
and I would agree a little slower sorry
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
closer to the microphone please ask next
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
time please thank
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
you as a result condo associations
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
rather than the electric utility would
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
have have the authority to determine the
 
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
rate classification residential or
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
non-residential under which it would pay
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
for utility Service as a result of that
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
shift and who determines the appropriate
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
utility rate there is a potential for
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
the under recovery of costs and shifting
 
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
of costs between residential to
 
00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:16.190 align:start position:0%
of costs between residential to
non-residential

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
non-residential
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
customers 53 House Bill 537 inappropri
 
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.039 align:start position:0%
inappropriately shifts the determination
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
of an appropriate rate from the utility
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
to the customer allowing Hondo
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
Association to choose what rate it wants
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
to take services
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
under um and I think there there was a
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
question before as to why uh as to condo
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
associations being commercial rather
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
than residential um condo owned but if
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
you have shared residential space that's
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
under the homeowners
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
association um that that is a that is
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
nonr a homeowners association is
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
non-residential in terms of uh Electric
 
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
utilities and therefore it would be a
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
non-residential commercial rate um and
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
the department believes that there is uh
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
a non-legislative solution to this issue
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
simply uh it is our understanding simply
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
changing the name of the account holder
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
from a condo association or a homeowners
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
association um or property management
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
company to a resident would change the
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
rate from a commercial one to a
 
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.630 align:start position:0%
rate from a commercial one to a
residential

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
residential
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
run and I'm happy to take questions um I
 
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919 align:start position:0%
am not well versed in condo law so I can
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
do my best but uh the
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh I'm happy to take questions where can
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
there must be a question I'm sure uh
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds well thank you
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
um Mr Vice chair and I'm I'm sorry I
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
can't really think of a way to phrase
 
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
this as a as a question but I'm glad you
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
just admitted that you're not an expert
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
in condo law because I believe that your
 
00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
assertion during your
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that condo associations are
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
commercial entities
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.590 align:start position:0%
uh is
incorrect

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
um the management
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
companies that condo associations might
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
hire to manage the Affairs of the condom
 
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.630 align:start position:0%
hire to manage the Affairs of the condom
andum

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
andum
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
Association are probably commercial
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
entities that I don't I think that these
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
those concepts are being conflated
 
00:23:25.159 --> 00:23:26.669 align:start position:0%
those concepts are being conflated
here

00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
condominium is a group of residences for
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
everyone's Ed ific I mean Condominium
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
Association a condominium is a legal
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
form of real estate ownership and
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
operation there are residential condos
 
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
where people live is there a question
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
there no I'm just we if we're going to
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
have a reason question and discussion we
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
we got to have this have the the facts
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
correct perhap perhaps perhaps I can
 
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
help perhap I I believe what the
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative was attempting to ask is
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
please explain why you feel that a condo
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
association would be residential uh
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
would be commercial versus residential
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
so it is just it's my understanding that
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
if you have a homeowners association
 
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
that is collecting dues and taking care
 
00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.039 align:start position:0%
of parts of a condo association with
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
shared spaces fountains um even uh I
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
pump sheds or something like that where

recap you just indicated that there is
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
an alternative vehicle for ensuring that
 
00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:29.669 align:start position:0%
an alternative vehicle for ensuring that
one

00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
can uh uh condos can uh get the

residential rate and that's just through
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
the process of making sure that they've
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
filed as non-commercial use and that
 
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
takes care of it is that that is our
 
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.590 align:start position:0%
takes care of it is that that is our
understanding

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
yes the Department's understanding

yes okay I'll take I'll I'll take this
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
time for the final question SL comment
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
is that I am a little bit bit um
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
perplexed as to uh why we don't have a
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
utility represented here today that
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
might have answered some of those
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions is this um do you believe that
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
this is something that the utilities
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
could have answered or is this fall
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
directly under the uh
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
doe they they could have more
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
information as but I I can't speak to
 
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
them I not
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
sure okay okay representative Tom's last
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
question sure thank you um your
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
suggestion about billing to individual
 
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
units um is a little off base because um
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
this this bill is about shared meters so
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
can you speak to that please um so I
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
think it just comes down to uh I think
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
in section one where uh it's talking
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
about I'm just just trying to find where
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%

I'm sorry could
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
you I'm just trying to uh figure out
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%

suggestion about billing to individual
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
units um with regard to this bill but
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
the bill is about the shared meters not
 
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:49.950 align:start position:0%
the bill is about the shared meters not
individual

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%

to you thank
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
you okay see any other questions thank
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
you very much I do not see any other uh
 
00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
cards here for speakers so I will
 
00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:04.029 align:start position:0%
cards here for speakers so I will
declare

00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
declare
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
this point of order Vice
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
chair I also had trouble in
 
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
comprehending with the speed of of the
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
last presenter as did representative
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
Thomas what would be the correct way
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
to interrupt
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
the I would say in a in a case like that
 
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
you would raise your hand and say
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
question for the chair and then I would
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
recognize you and then you would ask the
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
chair to uh please advise the uh
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
testifier to speak slowly more clearly
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
microphone thank
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
you okay with that being said I declare
 
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
public uh testimony for HP 537
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
closed and since we have about 2 minutes
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
of space here uh it'll be 2 minutes
 
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
before we open testimony on the next
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
reprieve yeah what's unclear to me is is
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
are the reasons for this billing built
 
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
into these statutes the rsas or not
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I don't understand the
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.399 --> 00:31:06.750 align:start position:0%
 
are

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
I was was entertained watching the
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
videos last night entertained by what I
 
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay I declare the public hearing open
 
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
for HB
 
00:31:55.389 --> 00:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
539 and I have a representative Al now
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
to please come up again and introduce
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
00:31:59.120 --> 00:31:59.990 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
welcome

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair my name is Alison
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
NAB representing Rockingham 12 stratum
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire thank you for having me
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
in front of the committee again today um
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned 539 is quite similar to
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
537 the bill that we just spoke about um
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
it just introduces it in a different
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
place in Statue so it would be Our
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
intention to amend these bills to
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
combine them into one but if you don't
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
mind uh Mr chair me address seen a
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
couple of the concerns that have come up
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
that would impact both these bills I'd
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
like to do that or I'm sorry could you
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
repeat that um if you don't mind if I
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
speak in general to some of the concerns
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
that have come up about this legislation
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's your time sure well I just I
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
want to be in order um so one of the
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
pieces that I would like to mention is
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
that it has been unitel who is the
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
utility impacting the condo association
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
in our town it has been their position
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
that a shared meter must be um build at
 
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
a commercial rate and they've been
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
unwilling to address this issue or
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
change it in any way which is why we
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
have arrived at attempting a legislative
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
solution um it's been suggested that
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
this could be done in a non-legislative
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
way and that is true but I would just
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
ask you to imagine a situation in which
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
a single homeowner becomes responsible
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
for a shared um a shared meter and then
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
has to Bill out the other people that
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
share that meter with him it's it's
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
complicated and not and and I think
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
problematic it would be non-legislative
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's a very clean
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
solution and I think it's rape with
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
problems problems to ask a single
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
homeowner to then be the billing agent
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
for a shared meter and um you had asked
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
a question earlier about 378 and 378
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
just adds the Electric Co-op to the list
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
of utilities impacted so that is true
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
for all three pieces of legislation that
 
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
378 has been added so um again and and
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
to address the I mentioned this earlier
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
but you know just as a reminder this
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
does impact septic and well that is an
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
effort to make this very tailored to
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
something that is considered residential
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
if you are a resident of a home or a
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
condo you have a right to septic and
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
well that's not a pool it's not a shared
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
event space it's not an office it is a
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's a component of being a resident and
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
so um this is an attempt to get those
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
those charges addressed at a residential
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
rate instead of a commercial
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
rate and with that I will try and answer
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
questions I have one question out of oh
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
ploi thank you Vice
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
chair since you brought you you were
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
using your time I'm looking
 
00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:49.790 align:start position:0%
using your time I'm looking
at

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
property I owned shared laundry
 
00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.149 align:start position:0%
property I owned shared laundry
facilties

00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
facilties
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
commercial these Condominiums because of
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
the Condominium Act uh RSA they're
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
residential but they want to share like
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
the laundry room
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
and we as a condo owners they all own
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's no commercial Venture they're just
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
trying to split the expense evenly for
 
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.630 align:start position:0%
trying to split the expense evenly for
Mutual

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
Mutual
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
use and I'm having trouble why utilities
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
want to call that a commercial it's not
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
open to the public it's just that
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm just looking at as a fair share
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
and it needs a meter so they can a lot
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
can you comment on my or could you reply
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
to my comment make sense out of it thank
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
you well it sounds like you're speaking
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
to the concern that we have right and
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
why this bill was introduced yes I and
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
so maybe I'm not understanding your
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
question rip couldn't
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
explain I'm sorry to I was using that
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
for one example because it a Wells and
 
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.589 align:start position:0%
for one example because it a Wells and
the

00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
septic why isn't it all I know you're
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
trying to whittle out those
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
two and I can't understand why it can't
 
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
be all of those shared expenses
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
but um sure and I'll I'll take a stab at
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
it um this bill a similar version of
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
this bill was introduced to the um
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee last term and they
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
had some questions about if you had you
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
know a shared space that maybe someone
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a party in or a pool and
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
it sort of got murky as to whether that
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
was truly residential or those spaces
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
considered what if someone charged for
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
them what if they had some commercial
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
component I think is that is that sort
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
of what you're getting out so I think
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
that's why it was tightened to just say
 
00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599 align:start position:0%
you know the water that you're getting
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
out of your tap and the septic that
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
you're using in your condo um that's
 
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
what would be impacted here and not a
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
shared space like a laundry room or like
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
a vent space or like a
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
pool is is there a followup question no
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
I I believe my question has been
 
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
RS thank you Vice chair I promise it's a
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
question uh representative NAB do you
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
believe that the department of energy is
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
mistaken in their
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
a blanket classification of all
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
residential condominium associations in
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
entities um I I'm not going to call them
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I think it's a really
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
problematic term because you get into
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
having a couple of different ideas of
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
what is commercial I don't think
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
something should be Comm considered
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
commercial just because it's shared so
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know if three condos are sharing one
 
00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.430 align:start position:0%
you know if three condos are sharing one
meeting

00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:37:59.470 --> 00:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think that should make it
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
inherently commercial um and I think
 
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
most of us when we think of the term
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
commercial especially given that there
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
are condos that are truly commercial
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
that have real businesses in them um
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
you're creating this really murky setup
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
when you're using that term so um than
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
so I do disagree with their assertion I
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
guess but I think they're basing it on
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
something that maybe exists in other
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
places besides the department of energy
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
this idea that a condo association is a
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
commercial entity
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay you see no further
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
questions thank you again for your
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
testimony I appreciate it and again I
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
will call on Mr Richard sweat again from
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
LA to give his testimony on
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
well once again thank you for having me
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
to testify on Bill one 539 you know who
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
I am so we'll skip that uh HB 539 amends
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 371a so that residential electric
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
rates for domestic consumption shall
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
apply to well and septic systems of
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
individual units within a condominium
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
Association which does not permit
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
commercial or business
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
enterprises so back again we're trying
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
back to the definition of a residential
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
condominium so I will say your electric
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
bill has two sections one section is the
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
supplier's kilowatt charge for delivery
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
and the other and that kilowatt charge
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
is assigned by the Pu tariff it's either
 
00:39:59.309 --> 00:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
a SCH G which is commercial or a
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
Schedule D which is domestic now the
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
electric supplier supplying electric
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
energy competes for customers in the
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%

00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%

2025 this is a competitive Marketplace
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
the other portion of the bill is the

delivery of electric energy to a Regal
 
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%

this bill oh thank you very
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
much representative R you got a question
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr Vice chair
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
um in your view is the problem is the
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
Crux of the problem that this bill
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
addresses the fact that it appears to be
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
the utilities who have
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
the power the discretion to assign the
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
rate class to condominium
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
associations the answer and no one else
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
the answer to that is yes back in 2021
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
October of 2021 we started our
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with unitel we wrote a
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
registered letter to I forgotten the
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
name of the gentleman he was a vice
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
president of the of of the of the
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
organization he assigned it to another
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
vice president of the organization who
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
assigned it to the rate manager of the
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
organization and we dealt with uh unel
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
for a period of time and that was
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful then we went and we dealt
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
with the Department of energy we spoke
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
with Amanda Nunan and I forgotten the
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
other gentleman's name and uh we did not
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
get any resolution so now we were we
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
were it was recommended that we look for
 
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
a legislative resolution of this problem
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
and so we are here today for that
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
you okay I have one final question uh
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
and please understand I don't I've never
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
lived in a condo I'm not familiar with
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
condo you don't know what you're missing
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
I know someday I may have to I don't
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
know so is is this bill 539 saying
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
that the utility is is um charging
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
commercial rates to well pumps and
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
septic systems to uh that are shared by
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
condoman and that they ought to be uh
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
charging residential rates that's
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
exactly right a matter of fact one of
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons why this bill is limited
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
limited to residential Condominiums and
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
limited to septic systems and well pumps
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
is because a year
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
ago the department of energy again
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
objected to that bill because it was too
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
broad they thought that it it should be
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
it was too broad it would include as I
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
said before clubhouses which could could
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
should be running out for a profit which
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
would be commercial it could include
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
swimming pools that might be running out
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
for swim meets so it was too broad so
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
this bill was designed to to address
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
that objection and make it specifically
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
for residential condominiums for the
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
specific purpose of making making those
 
00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:29.510 align:start position:0%
specific purpose of making making those
units

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
habitable thank you and my followup uh
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
clarification question would be
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
there this going to sound very obvious
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh so therefore if there were cheaper
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
rates assigned to the septic and and
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
well systems those rates would be
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
savings would be equally distributed
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
amongst all of the condo owners that
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
would be true that would that would be
 
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.710 align:start position:0%
would be true that would that would be
true

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
yes okay well thank you for indulging my
 
00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:57.349 align:start position:0%
yes okay well thank you for indulging my
ignorance

00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
ignorance
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
condos thank you that's all right we're
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
educate I have a question from
 
00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:05.390 align:start position:0%
educate I have a question from
representative

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you and thank you
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
foring my question I'm just uh looking
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
at line 14 of the bill it seems to be
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
the main thrust of it here it says
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
residential electric rat for domestic
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
consumption shall apply to well pump and
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
septic systems for individual units
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
within the condo so basically what
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying here is you're going to be
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
charging somebody in a condo the same
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
way the same way like I paid at my house
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
I have a well and a septic system and I
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
get charged residential rat this would
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
be applying that same standard to
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
Condominiums that's true and followup
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
and it's not being done consistently now
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
or is it not being done at all or well
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
right now we're being charged a
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled G rate which is a commercial
 
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
rate and the design of 537 539 and 680
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
is to correct that imbalance and get
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
assign the scheduled drate which you are
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
which you pay as a
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
residential consumer of electricity okay
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
again I can wait go ahead goad M Thomas
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you um can you give me an idea
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
can you please give me an idea of the
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
financial impact to go from schedule G
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
to schedule D how much money are we
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
talking about I would say say this it
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
would only affect the delivery side of
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
your utility bill and I would say on the
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
delivery side of your utility bill it
 
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
meter I'm sorry is that per month uh
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
followup yes that would be uh on a
 
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
I just it's really a quick question one
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
I'll one quick followup represent
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you uh so I'm assuming
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
electric service for an individual well
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
pump or pumps for individual electric uh
 
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
septics systems typically run through
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
the residential meter on a home or a
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
condo when a well or septic system
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
provides water and septic to multiple
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
homeowners the electric service to those
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
systems benefit multiple customers and
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%

status of the organization to whom the
 
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
service is build the service is
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately classified as commercial
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
whether for-profit or nonprofit those
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
organizations are required to register
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
as a business with the Secretary of
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
State hopefully that can provide a
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more clarification to what I
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
was talking about earlier thank
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions representative
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you thank you foring a
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
question I think this is sort of the key
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
Point here on this bill what you're
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
saying is that if if I'm in a
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
condominium and I have I guess would be
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
a single electric meter that covers not
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
only my refrigerator and you know light
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
bulbs and so forth but also covers my my
 
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.150 align:start position:0%
bulbs and so forth but also covers my my
we

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
and my septic I'm charged 100% the
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
residential rate but if in the
 
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
condominium there's let's say eight
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
units and all eight have a mutual um
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
well pump and a mutual septic system
 
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
which is charged to basically a third
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
entity and then distribute it to the
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
condominium that that's charged the
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
commercial rate is that correct yes all
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
you Miss
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
Stone next up we'd ask Michael Lata of
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
eversource to give us his perspective on
 
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.109 align:start position:0%
eversource to give us his perspective on
this

00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
morning good morning uh Michael Lata
 
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
eversource energy uh really just here to
 
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
answer questions that the committee may
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
have uh I recognize that this appears to
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
be a specific situation uh with a
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
different util
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh however if I can answer questions
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best I might have to uh come
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
back and provide answers after the fact
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so you heard the
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
discussion of uh representative
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington uh and the answer was that
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
a shared septic and water meter for
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
multiple residential units is now being
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
considered commercial is that a
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement or is that a
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
utility making that
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
decision uh I'm
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
gonna ultimately the determination um
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
would be based upon our tariff which is
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
basically the kind of conditions which
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
we provide service to customers those
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
tariffs are approved by the Public
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and and in essence
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
carry uh similar of the force of law I I
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer of whether that
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement to to do that
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
treatment or whether it is in each
 
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.430 align:start position:0%
treatment or whether it is in each
utilities

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
tariff I I think the as my understanding
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the issue comes
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
to the use of the electricity versus The
 
00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.430 align:start position:0%
to the use of the electricity versus The
Entity

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
Entity
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
that the account is in so for
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
eversource if the account is in and the
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
meter is in the name of a commercial
 
00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
Enterprise they are charged the
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
commercial rates regardless of whether
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
the use is to support in this case a
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
multifam condominium or an apartment
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
building if it isn't a commercial entity
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
they pay commercial rates if it is in
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
the name of a residential
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
customer they pay residential rates the
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
utility is somewhat blind to what goes
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
on behind the meter if it's being used
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
for you know for for water for shared
 
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
lighting for whatever it might be at the
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
condominium so for us um it is there's
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
Clarity in saying you know you're a a
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprise you're registered
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State New
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire therefore you pay commercial
 
00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:26.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire therefore you pay commercial
rates

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
versus you know you're a commercial
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
customer but you're telling us and we
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
would have to believe you that this is
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
being used for a different purpose which
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
I believe for a residential purpose
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
which I believe is the intent of the
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill follow up follow
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
up so uh you may not have been here for
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh this comment from the Department of
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
energy but uh the suggestion was then if
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
that meter was put in the name of the
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
residents as opposed to the uh Condo
 
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
Association that would change its
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
building schedule from G to D such so in
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
this case the 10 residents that live at
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
that Condo
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
Association would all put their common
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
names on that water and sewer meter and
 
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:25.799 align:start position:0%
that would make this issue go away so I
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
I the only caveat I have to that is the
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
the the 10 names I I don't know from a
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
billing standpoint if it would have to
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
be in one individual I mean obviously
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
just I'll speak for myself my my wife
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
and I are both on on our electric
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
account I don't know how many people we
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
could could have on that account uh
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
listed but I I again I can take that
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
back and ask but to answer your sort of
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
the underlying philosophical
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
question if it is right now in the name
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
of a commercial Enterprise a condo
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
association and it is changed to a
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
residential customer or
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
customers yes that they would be charged
 
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:11.799 align:start position:0%
the residential rate thank you Vice
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas has a question uh thank you
 
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
question uh uh hopping on the previous
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
question from the previous
 
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
representative I can ask you would would
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
it be
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
a billing
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
conundrum if you were to put multiple
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
residential names onto one bill given
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that every single different
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
resident would likely have a different
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
address correct and so you know it would
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
the bill would go to one address if you
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
have multiple names I mean at that point
 
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
know how the association or or how that
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
group of customers would go about paying
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
the bill I mean that would be not
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
something that we would have insight
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
into um I I I understand the the
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
question I just it's would be you know
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
we send a bill to one address usually it
 
00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:21.799 align:start position:0%
has one or or two names on it I I don't
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
know I I don't believe we could send it
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
to multiple addresses different names
 
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
you know there would be I think issues
 
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.990 align:start position:0%
you know there would be I think issues
with

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
that representative uh Harrington has a
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you U thank you for my
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure if you can answer
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
this but I'm going to just throw it out
 
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
for the point of discussion so let's
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
just say for example the condo
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
association had an agreement that said
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
the president of the condo association
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
is going to be the name on this common
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
meter and it'll be that person's name
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that person's address and then the
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
rules of the condo association will
 
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.870 align:start position:0%
rules of the condo association will
determine

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
how that money gets collected from
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
everybody and sent into the utility
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
would that then make it a residential
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
meter if the president of the condo
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
association was a residential customer
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
meaning that the the the account was not
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh a commercial account so he didn't
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
start his address if it was just Fred
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
Jones his address and he wants to you
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
know pass a hat around every month uh
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
again that would not be something
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
something that we would have insight to
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
we would only see this is a residential
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
customer therefore he should be charged
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
or she charge residential rates thank
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
you representative Swanson has a
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Lata for being here uh you're
 
00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:46.599 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of eversource would
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
unel have you think they would have the
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
same interpretation as far as when the
 
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
application is made that uh as far as
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
they would be determined to be
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
residental or commercial I I can only
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of eversource I can't uh
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
vouch for any other or or state any
 
00:59:05.549 --> 00:59:05.559 align:start position:0%
other utilities position on how they
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
apologize okay seeing no other questions
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair um so the
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
default position is if the name is a
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
associate or an entity it's going to get
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
a commercial rate is there an
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity within your Billing System
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
to ask one question further Downstream
 
00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:40.839 align:start position:0%
Association engaged in commercial
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
activity versus residential activity
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
could you flag the system that way and
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
then make this discrimination so I I I
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
think that would be
 
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.349 align:start position:0%
think that would be
problematic

00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think I think if this
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill were to
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
pass uh we would essentially code that
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
customer as
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
residential um and you know that's
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately a determination of of this
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
body if you want to do that to allow a
 
01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:15.829 align:start position:0%
body if you want to do that to allow a
commercial

01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
Enterprise to access residential rates
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
and again we don't you know we're sort
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
of taking it on Blind Faith that that is
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
in fact what's happening
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
different commercial you know we would
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
have no way of knowing that a different
 
01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:31.510 align:start position:0%
have no way of knowing that a different
commercial

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
Enterprise uh would say yet you know me
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
too I'm using this for just you know
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
residential purposes we have no way to
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
audit that check that I mean it it would
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
it would be beyond our capabilities and
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
you representative Matson has a question
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um I I was wondering how
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
difficult it would be for a commercial
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
entity to transfer over to residential
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
is that something that the association
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
can do
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
easily I I think it would be as simple
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
as uh just transferring the account into
 
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
an individual's name but I I can check
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
but I I don't think that that would be a
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
challenge representative PL uh thank you
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you Mr Lata I I missed in
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
my notes did everus have a position on
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions I
 
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:43.039 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Mr Lata for giving us
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
your perspective on this legislation I
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
have no more pink cards on this
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
bill would anybody else like to say
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
anything before I close this public
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
hearing okay this public hearing is
 
01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
closed we'll now move on to House Bill
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
68- FN I will open a public hearing on
 
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
that and ask representative Allison NAB
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
to introduce this legislation to
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
so the legislative uh budget office has
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
stated that this bill has no fiscal
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
impact on the state so the fact that it
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
has an FN on it at this point will be
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
deemed to be
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
irrelevant representative mc mc um NAB
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
not McNab but NAB thank you I like McNab
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
though that's good um thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
having me again Alison NAB ringham 12
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
representing stratum in New Hampshire um
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
680 FN is similar to the previous two
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
bills that we've been discussing the
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
only difference is that it does allow a
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
homeowners association to assign charges
 
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
for a shared meter back to the unit
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
sharing that meter splitting equally
 
01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
instead of passing it back to all
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
members of the association so um the
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that I have provided you adds
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
back in the Electric Co-op that was
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
inadvertently left out and that's part
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
of the previous two bills that you've
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
heard as one of the utilities impacted
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
um so uh I don't have much more to say
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
I'll just say you know sort of big
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
picture again I think this is a matter
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
of fairness it comes down to whether you
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
believe members of a condo in a
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
residential condo association should be
 
01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
charged at a commercial rate or if they
 
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
should be charged as residents as a
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
single family home would so I I respect
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
the concerns that the department of
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
energy has and that eversource expressed
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
about allowing an association to make
 
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
the determination as to whether they're
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
residential or or commercial and maybe
 
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be better
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
teased out in the legislation but um I
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
think inherently we're talking about
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
charging water and septic to Condo
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
Association members at a residential
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
rate they are residents they're not
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
commercial entities whether you want to
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
use the term commercial or not they are
 
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
not inherently commercial entities so um
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions but I
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
don't think I have anything further on
 
01:04:19.039 --> 01:04:22.150 align:start position:0%
don't think I have anything further on
this

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
bill okay questions representative
 
01:04:24.839 --> 01:04:26.589 align:start position:0%
bill okay questions representative
Arrington

01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
Arrington
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
my question I I understand what you're
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
trying to do here which which seems
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
pretty fair that the um you're saying
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
that since the residents and they're
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
using it for well and septic just like I
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
use for well and septic I should pay the
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
residential rate I guess my question is
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
as was discussed earlier is there
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
another alternative I mean could this be
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
done internally for instance the
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
president of the condo association puts
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
that group meter in their name and then
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
the condo association has rules that
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
says you know the president shall be
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
buildt for the group meter and they this
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
this charge shall be equally divided
 
01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:02.839 align:start position:0%
among the condo associate members and
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
paid to the president on a monthly basis
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
I mean wouldn't that just take care of
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
the problem without
 
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
legislation yes I mean it sounds like it
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
is a non-legislative solution to me it
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
feels a little bit funny because you're
 
01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
saying it's fine as long as it's in a
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
different name right I mean the
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
situation hasn't changed it's still
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
these homeowners is still condo members
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're putting the onus on a
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
condo association to run this internally
 
01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
on their own and a single individual to
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
be billing out to people um it is a
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
solution I think to me it feels a little
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
bit funny because it's like you're doing
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
something secretive that everyone says
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
is fine um just to make it utility
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
regulation sorry yeah welcome to the
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
world of uation familiar with it a lot
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
cooky so representative NAB on a similar
 
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
in a similar vein if you look down at
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
line 22 23 24
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
25 it says when fixing rates for
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
electric electricity the commission
 
01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:05.269 align:start position:0%
electric electricity the commission
shall

01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
shall
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
classify and it uses the word
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
classify residential units in homeowners
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
customers etc etc etc I don't know that
 
01:06:19.359 --> 01:06:21.309 align:start position:0%
customers etc etc etc I don't know that
the

01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
a residential unit in a homeowners
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
association I I think that might be
 
01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.029 align:start position:0%
association I I think that might be
outside

01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
outside
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:06:40.349 --> 01:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
statutory authority of the Public
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
so I would personally judge that this
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
particular version of the three bills
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
and I haven't unfortunately been here to
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
to hear all the discussion about the
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
previous two but but this one in
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
particular I would think this probably
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
isn't workable language might even be uh
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional the way it's worded so
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
we might have to to to think about a
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
different solution for that one
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
now since you're here can you explain to
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
us some email that we got from the prime
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor explaining
 
01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
that the operational plan and for these
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
three bills is to create an amendment
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
that puts them all together in a single
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill is that
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
still a plan and and do you know how it
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
would work
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
exactly um thank you for the question I
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
think that is still the intention I
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
think uh she recognized in reviewing the
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
three bills for today that they are very
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
similar and don't necessarily need to be
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
separate bills and it sounds like some
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
tweaking needs to be done um I take your
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
comment on the Pu you're more familiar
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
with the Pu than I am surely but um I
 
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
think that is still the intention and I
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
I think the the dream would be that
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
someone on this committee who's also
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
well versed in this or well versed in
 
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
the Pu would be interested in working on
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
that Amendment um but if that's not the
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
case we could certainly work on creating
 
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
an amendment that combines the three
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
bills so that two of them could be ited
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
and one could be moved
 
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
forward thank you additional questions
 
01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.149 align:start position:0%
forward thank you additional questions
representative

01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
you representative na take my question
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the language of the
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
bill that um chairman Vose just
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned around whether the Public
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission would be or should
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
be classifying residential uh units in
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations as anything
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
specific and I understand that what
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
you're trying to satisfy is to try and
 
01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
get some uniformity from the utilities
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
in this case it's Unitil but just in
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
general you want some language that
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
covers homeowners not even though your
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
particular case right um so I was
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if if we uh if we amended the
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
language that says classify to something
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
that isn't that doesn't have
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
um the same connotation but has the
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
meaning that you're trying to get at
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
like if they identify this class or if
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
they uh uh treat this class or you know
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
um consider consider yeah I was that I
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
was thinking of that earlier thank you
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
Michael yeah that they would consider
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
right that that then at least there
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
would be statutory language that would
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
give you the definitional framework that
 
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
you want but it doesn't require that the
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
Pu do anything
 
01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
specific does that sound like a
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
possibility for the amendment because
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking if you could solve the
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
problem that the chair brought up as
 
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
well if you're coming back with a a more
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
a more fome uh singular Bill Amendment
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
then uh that might be a good thing to
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
think about sure I think that makes
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
sense thank you for the question
 
01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:56.110 align:start position:0%
sense thank you for the question
comments

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative rols
 
01:10:01.709 --> 01:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah just one more
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
um substantive sort of
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
clarification question here on the
 
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
substance of the of the issue is is the
 
01:10:14.189 --> 01:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
existance of the problem that this bill
 
01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
is is aiming to
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
solve related to the physical
 
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
construction sometimes of Condominiums
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
where you know obviously there they're
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
joining units there's all different
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
shapes the way a building might be built
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
and and this problem has arisen where
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know the three units at the end
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
share a meter for their septic pump and
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
so you know there's just one pump is
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
that hang hang on a second is that the
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
question is that hang on a second please
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
is that where it originates there is a
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
member speaking so if you could hold
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
private conversations uh to a minimum or
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
take them outside we'd appreciate that
 
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
thank you please continue thank you Mr
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah so is it is it a physical
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
construction problem is that where this
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
issue arises sure I think that can be
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
the case and I think Mr SWAT could speak
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
better to that because I think in the
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
case of The Vineyards that is one of the
 
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
the issues that has caused this problem
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
is the way that the condo association
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
was designed but I would defer to him to
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
representative Matson has a question I
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
was wondering what you would think we
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
could do in the case of where some of
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
the condos are actually commercial and
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
the rest of them are residential so that
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
well sure and I think in one of the
 
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
previous bills it really delineates that
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
these are meant to be for only
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
residential condos so I don't believe
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's the case where you have a common
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
that this would apply I think it's in
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
situations where it's all residential
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
and again as the non-prime sponsor don't
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
quote me on that but that's my
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
understanding from the the language of
 
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
understanding from the the language of
the

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Harrington
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
question I just um with this the there's
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion here on this uh
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
commission shall classify I wonder if
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
something uh like this would appear to
 
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
work better uh when assigning the rates
 
01:12:28.629 --> 01:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
for electricity the utility shall
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
consider residential units in homeowners
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
associations as residential customers to
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
me that gets away from the because it's
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
actually the I believe it's just the
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
utility that's actually doing the
 
01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
assignment of the rate based on their
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
tariff and I don't know if you think
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
helpful um I think it's slightly above
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
my pay grade as to my understanding of
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
the utility versus the Pu so um I think
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's a great comment and I would take it
 
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.790 align:start position:0%
it's a great comment and I would take it
into

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of tweaking this
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
language as to which would be a better
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
fit um and you know maybe that's a
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
conversation to have with them and ever
 
01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.030 align:start position:0%
conversation to have with them and ever
sourcing

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
sourcing
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
unitel to follow on with that in line
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
seven it says the commission shall
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that all homeowners associations
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah once again that probably
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
should be that the utilities should
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
insure not not the commission I don't
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
think that's that that that's part of
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
the commission's charge
 
01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
the commission's charge
right

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none well thank you
 
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing this
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you call next on Miss
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
energy good morning again M uh Mr chair
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I'm Megan
 
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
Stone legislative leaon with the
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
Department of energy uh the department
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
is neutral on this bill as introduced um
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
but we do have concerns with it um first
 
01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
of all the public I'm sorry uh even if
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations are 501c3 not
 
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
for-profit entities they are still a
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
type of Corporation are required to
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
register as a business with Secretary of
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
State the department does not see how
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations can be Del ated
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
as residential any residential customer
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
applying for service would be build
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
under the applicable residential rate
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
while any commercial customer or
 
01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
business entity would be build at the
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
applicable commercial rate um
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore the Public Utilities
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
Commission sets rate for different rates
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
for different rate classes as defined in
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
the utility tariff New Hampshire's
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
electric utilities classify service
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
broadly as commercial or reg residential
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
with different rate options available
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
within each broad rate class the
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
department does not believe the
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
commission would have the authority or
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
resources to ensure how homeowners
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
associations are built um and lastly
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
this is just for informational purposes
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh State Statute only permits shared
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
meters in certain instances this is only
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
allowed in the state adopted addition of
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
international building code and
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
international energy conservation code
 
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
or as amended by uh local governments
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any
 
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
questions Vice chair Thomas has a
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you

for taking my
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
question a thought occurred to me if
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
this bill or any of them would pass
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
would this have any implications with
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
RPS Reggie net metering uh solar
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
subsidies anything like that would that
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
have any implications with any of those
 
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
programs I would have to get back to you
 
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
um on
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
so miss Stone did I under understand you
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
to say that the department believes
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
of declaring that a homeowners
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
association is a
 
01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.950 align:start position:0%
association is a
501c3

01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
501c3
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
entity in the eyes of the secretary of
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
state that autom automatically makes it
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
a business or commercial property yes

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
Richard Sweat Richard sweat of uh
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
stratum representing
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
nhlc I suspect you've already spoken on
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
this on this issue but we'll give you
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
Mr sweat the floor is yours thank you
 
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
very much I would like to say one thing
 
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
about this incorporation or
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
unincorporated business a Condominium
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
Association can be
 
01:17:16.629 --> 01:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
unincorporated under
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
356b there is no need for a Condominium
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
Association to become Incorporated it
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
can remain unin Incorporated to be
 
01:17:30.629 --> 01:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
incorporated is an option provided to
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
Condominiums if it is incorporated it
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
gets Incorporated under RSA
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
2922 and it uh and that is where you
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
register with the New Hampshire
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and you res register
 
01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
as a domestic nonprofit corporation the
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose is stated in that
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
form and basically the state statement
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
of purpose would say it is a residential
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
type corporation uh form for the benefit
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
of the residents so in our case The
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
Vineyards was unincorporated in 2014 it
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
decided to become Incorporated but legal
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys today give the advice to
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
Condominiums to remain unincorporated
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
and go back to being unincorporated
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
under RSA 3 56b so
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
uh it all I'm saying is there are
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
unincorporated corporate uh associations
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
and an
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated Association could give up
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
its incorporation status and go back to
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
be unincorporated so anyway I just
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to clear that up okay so anyway
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
I've spoken before so you know my Bon
 
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.229 align:start position:0%
I've spoken before so you know my Bon
aides

01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
aides
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
here um let me get on to this particular
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
one this is this is an interesting one
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
no doubt about it uh
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
basically it says that all shared
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
residential electric meters serving
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
residential units for domestic purposes
 
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
such as well and well pumps and septic
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
systems shall be built at the
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
residential rate we've been through this
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
before now in many condominium
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
associations the developer installed
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
shared residential electric meters
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
serving domestic purposes such as well
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
pumps and SE IC Systems in accordance
 
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
with utility plans approved by the
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
municipal and state authorities so the
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
developer got approval to do these plans
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
the Condominium Act 356b states that
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
condominium declaration shall name the
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
condominium which name shall include the
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
word condominium Condominiums as I said
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
can remain unincorporated or
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
Incorporated now whether you're
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
incorporated or
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
unincorporated associations manage the
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
association's payment of vendors
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
providing services to limited common
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
areas and limited common areas are owned
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
jointly by all the residents in The
 
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
Vineyards Association we have 76 units
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
all the common areas 176 of them are
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
owned by the residents they're owned by
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
the residents okay no commercial
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
ownership there at all anyway so the
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
common area the facilities such as
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
utility bills insurance premiums
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
contractors performing replacement
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repair service onc
 
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
common areas now if this payment method
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
were not in place it would go back to
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
what you ask the every Source person
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
every the the vendor would have to bill
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
76 unit owners separately for the
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
service they provide now in the case
 
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
where it's build to the management
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
company who is serving at
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
the request or at the option of the of
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
the association to provide the service
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
it provides a service to the vendor and
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
to the association so that 100 that 76
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
bills don't have to be sent out to each
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
s so this payment process benefits it in
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
vendors contracts doing business with
 
01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.950 align:start position:0%
vendors contracts doing business with
the

01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
association HB 680 amends 370 87 such as
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
the commission Bill all residential
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
units at residential rates even if the
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
association is paying the bills on
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of individual residential units
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
in the case of The
 
01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.629 align:start position:0%
in the case of The
Vineyards

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
Vineyards
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
Unitil bills us on the bill it states
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
the address where the billing is it
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
states that the customer is The
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
Vineyards of condominial Association and
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
it goes it's it care of great North
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
management company which is our
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
management company which pays the bills
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
so that's how that works and anyway uh
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
now you had a question of moving from
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
commercial to residential that was that
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to do the reason
 
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
being if you're more than 10 units you
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
have to go before the consumer
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
protection board and provide fill out a
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
form saying that you're now a
 
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
residential unit now I suppose it could
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
be done but I don't think there would be
 
01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
any commercial activities in it now
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
getting back to how easy it is to
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
identify a residential condomin it's
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
very easy all you have to go is go to
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
the registry of dates and look at the
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
condominium declaration the condominium
 
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
declaration is going to say whether
 
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
you're residential or commercial you can
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh would be another you could as I said
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
before you could ask the the uh consumer
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
Bureau of protection if there's more
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
than 10 residential units you can ask
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
them if that Condominium Association is
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
registered as a residential unit it's
 
01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:07.639 align:start position:0%
not difficult to to find and Define a
 
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
residential unit so anyway uh the
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
vineyard board of directors and the
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
condom Leadership Council support the
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
passage of
 
01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.470 align:start position:0%
passage of
hb680

01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
hb680
 
01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.430 align:start position:0%
hb680
thank

01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you Vice chair Thomas has
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
a question question uh thank you Mr
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
question just curious what what happens
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
if um one or two or a few more of your
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
residential condos are actually running
 
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
a business out of their condo could
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
could be mail orderer business or or or
 
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
other type maybe they're giving haircuts
 
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
inside there I don't know but what
 
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
happens if they are running a retail uh
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh business out well matter of fact we
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
did have that case with one of our uh
 
01:23:55.629 --> 01:23:55.639 align:start position:0%
unit owners and what what they did they
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
installed a separate meter that would
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
register the meter for their business
 
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
and the reason they did it was because
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
they could take a deduction on their
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
business tax for
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
electric electric usage so the answer is
 
01:24:17.229 --> 01:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
it did happen in our unit in our
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association and that unit
 
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
owner had unitel install a third another
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
usage representative Summers has a
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this is just a
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
quick one and it may have been covered
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
earlier I just want to make sure about I
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
know this legislation these last three
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
bills have had particularly had to do
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
with Condominiums and with this
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislation particular Condominiums how
 
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
does the I understand the different
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
rates commercial rate versus uh versus
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
residential but how would this differ
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
from apartment buildings multif family
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
residences town home associations
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations how how would
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
that how do Condominiums differ from
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
those and is there a particular reason
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
why this only goes at
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
Condominiums well one of the reasons is
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
that the Condominium Act
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
356 uh B defines Condominiums now if you
 
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
have a an apartment owner that's usually
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
owned by a company or a corporation
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
which are in the business of collecting
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
rents of making a profit of uh filing
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
taxes for depreciation commercial
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
purposes uh you know uh condominium is
 
01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:39.870 align:start position:0%
purposes uh you know uh condominium is
is

01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
by is is is defined by legislation uh I
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
mean I I that's the best way I can
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
question okay uh representative Wendy
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um my
 
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
question was um we this morning we have
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
heard I'm sorry this morning we have
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
heard three condominium bills in a row
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
one two three you've testified at each
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
of them do you see any conflict between
 
01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
together no I don't see any conflict on
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
them working together I would say I
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
would agree with uh representa NAB and
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative Manos that uh it would
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
have been more efficient if they were
 
01:26:31.709 --> 01:26:31.719 align:start position:0%
put into into into one bill I will
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
certainly say that but I mean that's my
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
answer to your question thank you no
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
that helps thank you representative
 
01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question thank you
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you take my question looking at
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
this it seems like the the whole uh
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
essence of this issue comes down to
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
these couple of lines on uh line 22 and
 
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
23 uh in the latest Bill we're looking
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
at here and if it was to say something
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
like like when assigning the rates for
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
electricity the utility shall consider
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
residential units in homeowners
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
association as residential customers and
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that all billing etc etc well the
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
whole nub of that comes down to then is
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
shall consider residential units in
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
homeowners association as residential
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
customers how would it would be defined
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
what a residential unit is and who is
 
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for doing that
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
well you can Define it
 
01:27:30.669 --> 01:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
by one once again go to the condominium
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
declaration it would say it's a
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
residential unit Mr chairman I just
 
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify my question a little
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
bit because I think I hang on and let
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
him okay elaborate yeah you can you can
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
Define it by going on looking at the
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
condominium declaration which is
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
required under
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
356b it'll
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
say the intent of the condomini it would
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
also give the plan that the condominium
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
has and it would also give a description
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
of the units
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
itself uh what was the second part of
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
your question I kind of forgot well what
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
I wanted to get to because I didn't make
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
I apologize for the question wasn't very
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
clear I I understand what you've been
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
saying that this is defined in various
 
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
documents and so forth but okay now you
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
your utility and you you got a new
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
condominium and they come say I want
 
01:28:25.149 --> 01:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
electricity to you know all the units
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
and plus we want and we have a joint um
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
account that's going to supply the
 
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
septic and the well to the uh
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
condominium now the utility says okay
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
and these are all going to Residential
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
Properties well so who does what at that
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
point is the utility supposed to go
 
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
research this are you supposed to get
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
all this paperwork together and file it
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
with the utility and they review it and
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
then say Oh okay we consider you based
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
on what you submitted a residential
 
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
customer or is that what the what's the
 
01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
yard stick the utility will use uh in
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
order to make that determination frankly
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
I have no idea I would certainly say
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
that that yard stick probably ought to
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
be incorporated in the
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
Pu uh tariff that basically reg
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
regulates domestic uh uh units I mean it
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
could basically say uh it could
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
basically say if you want a residential
 
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
rate make an application to the utility
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
and provide the reason you want a
 
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
residential rate such as under our
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
condominium okay additional
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions I would like to ask one um and
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
then I'll get to you representative
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
Swanson because I haven't heard you
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
speak before I missed your your first
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
two um uh appearances before the mic can
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
this problem be solved by the homeowners
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
in other words can the rules of the
 
01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.350 align:start position:0%
in other words can the rules of the
homeowners

01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
association determine how to divvy up
 
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
the well the rules do divvy up the cost
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
it basically says that the utility costs
 
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
are shared 176 by all the uh all the
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
units and and that and those costs are
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
included in the budget that the
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners have approved for the year
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
here so if the homeowners have approved
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
the budget of $10,000 for utility bills
 
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
it's included in their condominium fees
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh at 176 of the
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
cost so then the issue just becomes
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that the utility builds the
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
homeowners association at residential
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
rates versus commercial rates that would
 
01:30:45.199 --> 01:30:46.030 align:start position:0%
rates versus commercial rates that would
be

01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
true okay got it representative Swanson
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
has a
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
Mr sweat for being here and uh with
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
regard to the it was mentioned earlier
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
about the uh language in the uh the bill
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
and reference to the commissioner shall
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that all homeowners in one part
 
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
and then another part the commissioner
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
shall classify residential units uh to
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
your knowledge do you have any issues if
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
that uh term the commissioner would be
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
changed to the utility this is a uh
 
01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
lines 7 through
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
n of page one and lines 22 through 23 of
 
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
page one well I did not bring that
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
particular wait I've got
 
01:31:44.189 --> 01:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
it could you could you repeat those
 
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
lines again so uh right in House Bill
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
680 right so page one line 7 through 8
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
refer to the commission shall ensure and
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
also below that uh lines 22 and
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
23 the commission shall classify are two
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
Clauses that are in there and uh would
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
that be any problem as far as you're
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
concerned if that was changed to the
 
01:32:15.629 --> 01:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
utility shall ensure versus the
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
commission shall
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
ensure I'm really not sure I understand
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
that question I mean the the Public
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
Utility Commission
 
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh approves the rate tariffs that the
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
utilities present to them so I'm not
 
01:32:37.629 --> 01:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
question um I'm not sure how to rephrase
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
it so I'll defer it this time if
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
somebody can clarify my question because
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
it was brought up earlier about the term
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
the commission shall earlier Mr
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
chair okay maybe Mr lot can some shed
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
some uh light on that and he'll be
 
01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
testifying in just a minute okay thank
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr sweat are there any further
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
SWAT seeing none thank you sir
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here and now Mr
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
Lata will come back up and um maybe have
 
01:33:14.669 --> 01:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
some new information that he's gathered
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh that he can share Mr
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
Lata uh again for the record Michael
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
AATA representing eversource energy
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
apologies I don't have new information
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
to share but uh I did want to just
 
01:33:31.109 --> 01:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
respond to I guess some of the
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh thoughts of members of the committee
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
about different responsibilities of of
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
different entities uh so not on the
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
underlying bill but uh I think it's
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's in response to some of the
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
questions from representative Harrington
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
and and representative Swanson um
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
so it's been disc
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
whether to give the utility the
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to to ensure that um the
 
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
customer is a condo association that
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
they're using uh would be using this
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
electricity for shared residential
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
services and I just wanted to be very
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
clear the utility doesn't have the
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
ability to to make those determinations
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
or do audits essentially what you if you
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
were to move in that Direction you would
 
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
be setting up a system where a
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
commercial entity would be self-
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
declaring to the
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
utility that they are a condo
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
association they are a homeowners
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
association that this is used for septic
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
or portable water and the utility would
 
01:34:47.229 --> 01:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
accept that self declaration um we we
 
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know wouldn't be going out and and
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
you know doing field audits of these
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
these ities I presume you wouldn't want
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
us to do that because of the expense
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
involved so again as you consider
 
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
different options for these bills and
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
placing um different responsibilities I
 
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out from
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
eversource's perspective you know there
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
are limitations to what we can ensure
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
and we would be relying uh I believe
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
obviously depending on on how this would
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
all be structured on the entity to
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
self-certify to us that they are
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
sort of this unique class of customer
 
01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
you know a homeowners association that
 
01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
are using shared services for specific
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
residential purposes so just again in
 
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
response to some of the concepts being
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
discussed uh just trying to think
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
through practically how the utility
 
01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
would would try to manage that uh and
 
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
again I I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
so would you
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
not do you think it should be the
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
commission's responsibility to ensure
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
and or classify or do you think that
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
should happen in
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
scenarios I guess you're so I am not
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
familiar in any meaningful way other
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
than having just heard the citation with
 
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 356
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't know what is required of a
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
condomini Association a homeowners
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
association what documentation they have
 
01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
to any entity in the state of New
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it's the secretaries
 
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
of Secretary of State's office or
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise in order to come into fruition
 
01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
and so I don't know if there is a uh
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
within state government a an entity that
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
has reports and documentation of the
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
existence of these entities that either
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission could
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
could use to verify or or any other
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
entity and so I think absent that and
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
again it very well may exist I I am not
 
01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
the expert uh but absent that I think
 
01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
any entity would be relying on you know
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
this Association to do that
 
01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
self-reporting uh and and you know would
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
have limited ability to
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
verify this statutory language says on
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
line 22 when fixing rates for
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
electricity the commission
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
shall does the commission fix rates for
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
electricity I thought the utilities did
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
that so the the
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
utilities uh proposed rates to the
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission through a
 
01:37:50.669 --> 01:37:50.679 align:start position:0%
number of different adjudications uh
 
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
there are distribution rates that are
 
01:37:56.189 --> 01:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
are set through periodic rate cases
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
there are transmission rates that are
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
set every six months there are energy
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
Supply rates as the committee is is well
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
aware and so it would be the
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
commission's approval of the utilities
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
proposed rates is is essentially so they
 
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
are the rate sent setting entity whether
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
use fixed or or otherwise but um there
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
are obviously they're ultimately
 
01:38:22.109 --> 01:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
approving the rates that the utilities
 
01:38:22.119 --> 01:38:23.669 align:start position:0%
approving the rates that the utilities
set

01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
set
 
01:38:25.589 --> 01:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
so at the very least the language should
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
say when approving rates for electricity
 
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you further questions
 
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
representative M uh McGee thank you Mr
 
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Lata for taking my
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
question so it sounds like we're
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
grappling back and forth with um the
 
01:38:43.229 --> 01:38:43.239 align:start position:0%
language as it exists but from what I've
 
01:38:48.109 --> 01:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
heard since I've been here um it it it
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
appears to me that perhaps it's the
 
01:38:52.030 --> 01:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
utility that we're really talking about
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of servicing these homeowners
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
associations and viewing them as res as
 
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:01.159 align:start position:0%
having a residential rate apply to them
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
so is there some meaningful way that we
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
can make that clarification based on the
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
utilities because that seems to be where
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
the issue is with the folks that brought
 
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
forth the bill they're just trying to
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
Grapple with how to solve it sure uh as
 
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
I said on the other Bill the
 
01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.149 align:start position:0%
I said on the other Bill the
utility

01:39:21.149 --> 01:39:21.159 align:start position:0%
utility
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
um is not privy to what goes on behind
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
the meter and so if a commercial entity
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
applies for service then they are
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
charged a commercial rate if a
 
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
residential homeowner or apartment you
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
know residential um uh customer applies
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
for service they're given the
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
residential rate and so the utility is
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
blind to what the commercial entity does
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards and so ultimately if it's the
 
01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
determination of the legislature to say
 
01:39:59.229 --> 01:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
we're creating a new class of customer
 
01:40:02.669 --> 01:40:02.679 align:start position:0%
and we want you to say if it's a uh
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
homeowners association or a Condominium
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
Association nonprofit to treat them as
 
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
um as a residential customer then you
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
know we we will do that what I'm
 
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
pointing out here is we'll have no way
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
of verifying that that commercial
 
01:40:24.669 --> 01:40:24.679 align:start position:0%
Enterprise does what it is telling us it
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
does representative Bernardi has a
 
01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:31.639 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh so again
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
I'm pivot off of uh a suggestion by
 
01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington would it be uh
 
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
a unacceptable solution from the utility
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
perspective if this legislation
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
basically said homeowners associations
 
01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:50.679 align:start position:0%
or condo
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
associations that have common
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
Residential Services must identify a
 
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
single entity the president the
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
secretary of the association whatever as
 
01:41:04.679 --> 01:41:05.470 align:start position:0%
secretary of the association whatever as
the

01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:07.719 align:start position:0%
residential bill
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
collector or Bill
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
addressy would that I I think that would
 
01:41:13.199 --> 01:41:14.870 align:start position:0%
addressy would that I I think that would
solve

01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
solve
 
01:41:18.109 --> 01:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
this so I is that unacceptable to the
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
utilities yeah I think I don't want to
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
sort of speak in the moment without
 
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
being able to sort of review a proposal
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
But ultimately as we discussed
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
previously if it's in the name of a
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
residential customer they will get
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
charged the residential rate and however
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
they collect it sounds from 70 or so um
 
01:41:47.229 --> 01:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah so it sounds like in lie
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
of what was just Des discussed and
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
having an actual resident do it there
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
the problem with having the com the U
 
01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:01.639 align:start position:0%
Condo Association be the billing
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
recipient is that there's no real
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
definition of what constitutes a
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
residential customer so from the point
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
of view of the utility if there was some
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
type of a filing that a condo
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
association could make with the
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of state or whatever saying or
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
maybe the Pu saying uh we we're going to
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
make this filing because we propos that
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
all the usage of this electricity is
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
going to be used by for residential
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
purposes by residential customers and
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
then the Pu is issues them I don't know
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
a certificate of residence or something
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
and then when you go to Bill they say
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a residential customer here's my
 
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
certificate does that make your problem
 
01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:41.709 align:start position:0%
certificate does that make your problem
go

01:42:41.709 --> 01:42:41.719 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:42:41.719 --> 01:42:44.830 align:start position:0%
go
away

01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
um again would want to actual actually
 
01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
review language but you know if you have
 
01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
City presumably that it could beway
 
01:43:00.639 --> 01:43:03.350 align:start position:0%
City presumably that it could beway
thank

01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee thank you Mr
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
chair and I just wanted to make a point
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
that um I believe that Mr SWAT um
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
testified that the secretary of state
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
does have a list of the homeowners
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
associations so I'm just wondering if
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
there seems like we could maybe connect
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
the dots in terms of you're saying you
 
01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
have no idea what's going on behind that
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
but if they are to be in a in a separate
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
category because they're Incorporated
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
not Incorporated you could probably find
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
that information if you were if you were
 
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
servicing the area so I'm just wondering
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
if they're um if you would agree that
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
that is something that could potentially
 
01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.790 align:start position:0%
that is something that could potentially
be

01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
uncovered again I'm not familiar with um
 
01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
356b and
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
what requirements are uh are in place
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
however if um you know if an association
 
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
is required to uh register with the
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and they were to
 
01:44:10.109 --> 01:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
provide uh evidence of that registration
 
01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
at the time of uh starting
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
service I guess it's sort of similar to
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's thought
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps that could be um an option that
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
would not still it's a public policy
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
determination but you know I'm sort of
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
testifying on the perspective of the
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
utility that we don't want to take on
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
additional administrative
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
burdens all right we seem to be going in
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
circles here so I think U we've beat
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
this horse about as
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh significantly as we can obviously we
 
01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
have some work to do to figure out how
 
01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
to proceed here but um I think we can
 
01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
maybe think about forming a subcommittee
 
01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.669 align:start position:0%
maybe think about forming a subcommittee
to

01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:56.109 --> 01:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
to hammer out a final solution for this
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
bill and um
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about doing that um let me
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
see a show of hands of people who would
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
be willing to serve on a subcommittee on
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
this bill I see
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
volte all right so uh I will appoint
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi to the
 
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and the first named person
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee will be the
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's chair I will appoint
 
01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
representative reels I will appoint
 
01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.229 align:start position:0%
representative reels I will appoint
representative

01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
McGee I will appoint representative
 
01:45:50.119 --> 01:45:54.149 align:start position:0%
McGee I will appoint representative
Harrington

01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
how many is that I lost that's three I
 
01:45:59.589 --> 01:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
guess we
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
need let's do five
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
maybe so representative Corman and
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
five all right so we have a subcommittee
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's the responsibility of the
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair to schedule
 
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.910 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair to schedule
subcommittee

01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
meetings so keep your eye out on the
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
calendar for a subcommittee meeting on
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
this question and representative NAB you
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
should be alert to subcommittee meetings
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
on this subject as will representative
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
Manos I'm sure and
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
um the subcommittee can decide what's
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
the best way to proceed to to solve this
 
01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
problem so with that I'm going to close
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 6
 
01:46:58.589 --> 01:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
80- FN it is now 12 minutes or so before
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
maybe 15 minutes before 11: and I'm
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
going to ask that everybody in the room
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
clear out so that we can have a
 
01:47:10.589 --> 01:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
republican caucus I would like all
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
members to be back in the room by
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
11:05 at which time there may be an
 
01:47:18.159 --> 01:47:20.310 align:start position:0%
11:05 at which time there may be an
executive

01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%

01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%

02:08:51.149 --> 02:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
our federal legislation legislation to
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
our governor and to the surrounding
 
02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
states that there are severely
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions that have uh
 
02:09:04.589 --> 02:09:04.599 align:start position:0%
affected our fishermen who in my opinion
 
02:09:07.549 --> 02:09:07.559 align:start position:0%
and I believe truly they know their
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
ocean best and these questions have not
 
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
been thoroughly vetted or answered for a
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
long time that could affect the food
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
chain their livelihood environmental
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
concerns of the
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
seabed ETC as well as undetermined costs
 
02:09:26.109 --> 02:09:26.119 align:start position:0%
of what it might cost the rayer based on
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
examples that we have seen around the
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
world and until and until those
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
questions are thoroughly vetted and
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
answered to everyone's satisfaction that
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire declares that we uh
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
categorically reject offshore wind uh in
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Maine and we also ask and
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
call upon the surrounding states to uh
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
look at this as well and to uh talk to
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
their fishermen uh for a perhaps a
 
02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
similar determination but for right now
 
02:10:00.510 --> 02:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that offshore wind is
 
02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
right for New Hampshire and uh because
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
there are so many unanswered questions
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
and these the uh testimony we received
 
02:10:11.709 --> 02:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday was was very adeptly um uh
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
spoken to by several members of the
 
02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
fisherman's Association uh on potential
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh harming effects of the water in in
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
seab bid so with those that things in
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
mind I believe we should pass this
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
resolution further
 
02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
nter thank you Mr chairman yesterday's
 
02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
hearings were very educational and I en
 
02:10:38.189 --> 02:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
enjoy hearing from the fishermen and um
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
the others who testified and um talking
 
02:10:43.709 --> 02:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
about the circle of life in the ocean
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
and how everything in the ocean is there
 
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
to be eaten by something else in the
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
ocean and and how disruptive these
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
windmills are we we also learned about
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
how um potentially dangerous they are
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
with um with how they're made you know
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
they have these toxic chemicals and they
 
02:11:05.229 --> 02:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
talked about the one that broke so um
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting for it to pass this bill
 
02:11:11.709 --> 02:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
as well additional conversation uh
 
02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
02:11:19.069 --> 02:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so um I also found the
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh testimony of the fisherman quite
 
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
compelling yesterday and I think that
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
there are many issues that need to be uh
 
02:11:28.669 --> 02:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
accommodated and investigated I don't
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
believe that New Hampshire should close
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
the door on participating in the process
 
02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
to figure out whether this is a a
 
02:11:41.709 --> 02:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
solution that can assist the area I also
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
think it makes no sense for us to be
 
02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
rejecting out of hand something where we
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
really haven't been at the table for
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
that long um to
 
02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
have the answers to the questions that
 
02:11:55.069 --> 02:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here the hearing
 
02:11:56.669 --> 02:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
didn't answer a lot of the questions
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
about the technology there there needs
 
02:12:01.229 --> 02:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
to be a lot more and obviously if it is
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
going to go forward it's something
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
that's being pressed by the federal
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
government and that may be changing I
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't see any reason for us to make a
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
statement that we are um as our
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
utilities mentioned and others viia you
 
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
know if we're in all of the above
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
strategy then we shouldn't be uh pi
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
winners and losers and saying we can't
 
02:12:25.229 --> 02:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
do this one they all have downsides and
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
we've had that discussion before as
 
02:12:31.790 --> 02:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
well representative Harrington thank you
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
um well first of just be clear this
 
02:12:35.709 --> 02:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't this is the bill that just gets
 
02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
the state government office out and says
 
02:12:40.109 --> 02:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cautions that we need
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
to put in place and a lot of things we
 
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
and no this is sorry this is the res
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
this is the resolution one okay I'm
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
sorry wrong bill got it confused but the
 
02:12:57.549 --> 02:12:57.559 align:start position:0%
um the one thing I did want to bring up
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that this has been looked at for
 
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
quite some time I've been a member of
 
02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
the offshore wind commission for a few
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
years now and uh of all the people that
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
spoke there other than people from bone
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh which is u a government agency I
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
didn't hear a single person speak in
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
favor of it and at the last meeting we
 
02:13:17.069 --> 02:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
had there was probably over a 100 people
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
for the public to come to a a commission
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
meeting like that is I don't know how
 
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
many you've been two of different ones
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
but I've never seen that big of an
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
outpouring of people and not a single
 
02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
person spoken in favor of the bill so um
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
I think that uh having a resolution
 
02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
saying that we want to be very cautious
 
02:13:35.229 --> 02:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
going forward with wind is a good
 
02:13:39.310 --> 02:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
idea representative Wendy
 
02:13:42.669 --> 02:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um there are
 
02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
several um issues that I have with this
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
um piece of legislation first of all the
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
way that it's written um I used to be a
 
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
tech writer and um I would never turn in
 
02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
a a document like this for example on
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
line 8 it says um that toxic water back
 
02:13:59.470 --> 02:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
into the ocean in massive amounts well
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
quantify massive what is that um it also
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
references chlorine which we heard a lot
 
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
about which um from what I understand is
 
02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
old technology and is no longer used um
 
02:14:12.910 --> 02:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
there are two permits have already been
 
02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
awarded for the Gulf of
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
Maine and we heard from testifier um
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield that there have been
 
02:14:24.270 --> 02:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
extensive studies into the oceans EO
 
02:14:27.549 --> 02:14:27.559 align:start position:0%
ecosystem and the fishing industry and
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
the impact to rate payers um what we did
 
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
not hear which was in line 16 is that
 
02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
this is likely to exceed current rates
 
02:14:39.709 --> 02:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
again what does that mean quantify it um
 
02:14:42.109 --> 02:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
lastly uh telling other states what to
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
do I don't think is within our purview
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
um and as uh to uh representative
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
McGee's point this removes us from from
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
the table and it's just not good
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
business practice thank you
 
02:14:56.639 --> 02:14:58.510 align:start position:0%
business practice thank you
representative

02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair uh I have
 
02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
been a member of the Coastal Marine uh
 
02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
committee where this where the windmills
 
02:15:13.069 --> 02:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
offshore have been a major uh subject
 
02:15:16.750 --> 02:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
for several years and I've attended many
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the offshore wind committee meetings
 
02:15:24.310 --> 02:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
I never have heard the fishermen get
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
any opportunity in any significant way
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
to make their case they had their best
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
presentation and their best uh dialogue
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
yesterday in this committee where they
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
were able to uh put on the table the
 
02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
hazards of of the coatings on the blades
 
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the
 
02:15:50.549 --> 02:15:50.559 align:start position:0%
chlorination of the cooling system that
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
are us used to in the when you Rectify
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
AC to DC power uh in order to transmit
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
that power to Shore and that is that is
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
a uh they gave quantities uh very
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
specifically of 40% utilization rate and
 
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
100% utilization rate of how many
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
gallons of hot chlorinated water we
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to be dumped into the ocean
 
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
unacceptable it to totally kills all the
 
02:16:29.709 --> 02:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
micro uh um uh flora and fauna and and
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
that causes then uh a a Devastation of
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
the the downstream uh feeding of of any
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
marine life in the in the immediate area
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
so uh that's a major issue that needs to
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
get resolved uh and until that kind of
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
thing can be resolved
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.709 --> 02:16:57.719 align:start position:0%

02:16:57.719 --> 02:16:59.389 align:start position:0%

representative

02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr
 
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just a recreational fisherman
 
02:17:08.589 --> 02:17:08.599 align:start position:0%
but I like uh the commercial fishermen
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate the importance of the
 
02:17:13.469 --> 02:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
ecosystem and uh the preservation of the
 
02:17:15.870 --> 02:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
life within it and I like those
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
fishermen also some days wish I was
 
02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
fishing but not today
 
02:17:26.429 --> 02:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
um this bill is very problematic because
 
02:17:29.589 --> 02:17:29.599 align:start position:0%
it feels like additional regulation and
 
02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
I've heard it said that we have too much
 
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
regulation already and furthermore
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
there's some things that are very
 
02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
ambiguous in here especially this
 
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
assertion about uh rejection of all
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
projects I don't know if that's supposed
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
to be a message to anybody who wants to
 
02:17:47.389 --> 02:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
write on the back of the napkin or who
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
wants to prepare a submission to a
 
02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
commission or really what that entails
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
in additional in addition I have
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
problems with this uh lack of definition
 
02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
until such time as there is more
 
02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
complete understanding where's the
 
02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:04.519 align:start position:0%
definition of a more complete
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
understanding this is totally ambiguous
 
02:18:11.790 --> 02:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
and really to me pointless so
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
I disapprove of this bill further
 
02:18:14.519 --> 02:18:16.230 align:start position:0%
I disapprove of this bill further
discussion

02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair Thomas thank
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair well
 
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure uh for the benefit of those
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
that are new here resolutions are
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
non-binding whereas bills uh other bills
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
that uh attack this subject uh would be
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
binding this resolution is non-binding
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
and it's non-binding for one solid
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
reason wind turbin or offshore wind
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
would be in federal waters and the state
 
02:18:49.469 --> 02:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
cannot dictate by Statute what the
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
federal government cannot do uh when
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's not in its States territories what
 
02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
what this resolution does is it merely
 
02:19:04.910 --> 02:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
says we don't want offshore wind in our
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
fishing Waters I.E Gul of Maine um yet
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
because uh and it's been going on now
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
for years not just a short time there
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
are questions that have not been
 
02:19:18.509 --> 02:19:18.519 align:start position:0%
answered in many cases not even have
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
been addressed by the the federal
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
government so what this resolution does
 
02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
it's it sends it is sending a message to
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
everybody and gives backup to the
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
governor who has also stated during her
 
02:19:36.509 --> 02:19:36.519 align:start position:0%
campaign that she is not in favor of
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
offshore wind it gives her legislative
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
backup uh on on that point and perhaps
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
the messaging which is meant to be
 
02:19:48.429 --> 02:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
strong and is meant to say hey other
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
states please attention to what we're
 
02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
saying we know we can't tell you what to
 
02:19:54.990 --> 02:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
do but we're advising you to please look
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
at this because we don't think it's a
 
02:19:58.830 --> 02:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
good idea that maybe some of these
 
02:20:01.230 --> 02:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
questions will be answered to someone's
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and even the fishermen here
 
02:20:07.309 --> 02:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
said that they are not closing the door
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
on this uh until questions are answered
 
02:20:14.309 --> 02:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
so this resolution is merely a statement
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
saying hey we don't want this because of
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
the various reasons and that's why we
 
02:20:21.870 --> 02:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
have all those reasons listed
 
02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:23.309 align:start position:0%
have all those reasons listed

02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
rols thank you Mr chairman um as a
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative of
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth um a city which hosts a

02:20:40.349 --> 02:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
fleet and as a retired Coast Guard
 
02:20:44.110 --> 02:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
officer who has been on and around the
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
ocean for my entire professional
 
02:20:50.830 --> 02:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
career uh I've been to see in in the
 
02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
Gulf of
 
02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:53.550 align:start position:0%
Gulf of
Maine

02:20:53.550 --> 02:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
02:20:58.870 --> 02:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate and respect the input
 
02:21:01.389 --> 02:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
from the fisherman that we heard
 
02:21:01.399 --> 02:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
from the fisherman that we heard
yesterday

02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
um however there was also a lot of
 
02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:09.469 align:start position:0%
um however there was also a lot of
misinformation

02:21:09.469 --> 02:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
coming and
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh such as
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
the the gentleman who stated that um
 
02:21:21.550 --> 02:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
because the turbin would be floating
 
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
turbines and have anchor chains on them
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
that no vessels would be able to enter
 
02:21:31.630 --> 02:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
into the entire area of the floating
 
02:21:34.710 --> 02:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
wind turbines that's just not
 
02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
correct uh anything that's floating and
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
anchored in the
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
water as they stated the
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh lengths of those chains might might
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
be as big as that desk well those chains
 
02:21:54.510 --> 02:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
hang straight down okay yes uh at Great
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
depth there's a catary but
 
02:22:01.389 --> 02:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
uh nothing like that would prevent ships
 
02:22:03.389 --> 02:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
from passing
 
02:22:07.790 --> 02:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
within even 50 or 100 yards of of all of
 
02:22:10.590 --> 02:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
these floating turbines and so it's not
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
as though there would be this huge area
 
02:22:16.429 --> 02:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
of the ocean off limits to Mariners and
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh where fishermen in distress couldn't
 
02:22:20.309 --> 02:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
be rescued and all of that I just I just
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
had to call that out that one in
 
02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:25.070 align:start position:0%
had to call that out that one in
particular

02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
um but this is just not um the kind
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
of blanket statement that the state of
 
02:22:33.790 --> 02:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should be
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
making uh again as a representative
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth where the city's only sea
 
02:22:41.630 --> 02:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
port is located uh the port of
 
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh and in particular the
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
about to be decommissioned uh Schiller
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
Power Station both uh could be
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
significantly involved in an offshore
 
02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
wind industry and there could be
 
02:22:58.830 --> 02:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
significant Economic Development benefit
 
02:23:00.349 --> 02:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
from the port of Portsmouth being
 
02:23:01.469 --> 02:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
staging uh construction and management
 
02:23:06.670 --> 02:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
of uh offshore
 
02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:09.349 align:start position:0%
of uh offshore
wind

02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
wind
 
02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
installations so taking a blanket
 
02:23:16.910 --> 02:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
position that we reject it all until as
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
my colleague just stated the UN
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
defined better understanding is reached
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
is just not um not good public policy
 
02:23:31.389 --> 02:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
resolution okay everybody has had a
 
02:23:37.389 --> 02:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
chance to weigh in on this issue I don't
 
02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
think we need to have multiple
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
statements about it once you've stated
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
your position we understand it so uh I
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
would like to ask the clerk to call the
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%

recognizes representative Summers thank
 
02:26:39.389 --> 02:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so after watching
 
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
multiple hours of testimony yesterday
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
from all the folks that came in and tied
 
02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
to the last HCR we just discussed I was
 
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
impressed by the experience the research
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
and the technical the technical
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the fisheries and what they
 
02:26:59.710 --> 02:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
had to speak for them yesterday and
 
02:27:01.389 --> 02:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
especially what stood up to me was Mr
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
Len when he came out there and he spoke
 
02:27:06.190 --> 02:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
not only which important to me is an
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
Academia important with research but the
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
research was peer-reviewed there's
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
nothing more sacred in Academia than
 
02:27:15.469 --> 02:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed articles and that is what
 
02:27:18.429 --> 02:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
B all research is based on so with he
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
came out with peer-reviewed articles
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
talking about the chlorination the
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
chemicals in the water the disruption of
 
02:27:27.550 --> 02:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
the Plankton the effect of the small
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
fish the the uh with the shellfish
 
02:27:35.550 --> 02:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
fishing lobsters the way it was changed
 
02:27:39.269 --> 02:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
with them and of the uh also brought up
 
02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
the uh effect on
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
whales now um and lastly I mean there
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
was also right now there's currently an
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
executive order in effect blocking all
 
02:27:53.070 --> 02:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and it must be a real
 
02:27:56.590 --> 02:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
battle for those for those that on the
 
02:27:59.790 --> 02:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
other side that are for off where they
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
have chosen the importance of offshore
 
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
wind and taken the Precedence of
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.349 --> 02:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
paa okay discussion on HB 682
 
02:28:21.469 --> 02:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair as was stated
 
02:28:27.630 --> 02:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
during the testimony um this bill would
 
02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
remove New Hampshire from the discussion
 
02:28:33.070 --> 02:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
of of wind power completely and it's
 
02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
very clear that we need more power in
 
02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because we are not energy
 
02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
independent we don't have oil we don't
 
02:28:44.190 --> 02:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
have gas um we're already seeing the
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
impacts of these maybe tariffs from
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
Canada um the other thing that this bill
 
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
is it does not remove the renewable
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
energy task force however it neuters it
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
by removing all of its tasks and
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
responsibilities I will be voting
 
02:29:02.950 --> 02:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
against this Bill thank
 
02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
you I think you're incorrect about the
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill completely removing New Hampshire
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
from a discussion of offshore wind
 
02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
because while it does repeal the
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
commission and some other Associated
 
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
language about offshore wind the office
 
02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
of energy Innovation which would be the
 
02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
new title of that office will continue
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
to have authority to watch what happens
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
with offshore wind other discussion
 
02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah yeah as
 
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
far as that goes is with the interaction
 
02:29:38.110 --> 02:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
with other states the department of
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
energy still represents New Hampshire at
 
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
all the iso New England and neol various
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
meetings where potential win projects
 
02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
would be discussed so we're definitely
 
02:29:49.269 --> 02:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
going to be involved in that through
 
02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
that and through n go so it's it's not
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
like we're uh boarding up around here
 
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
the the other thing to remember is that
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
there has never been an offshore wind
 
02:29:59.950 --> 02:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
project proposed to be built in the
 
02:30:02.590 --> 02:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
United States that wasn't mandated by a
 
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
state government so right now New
 
02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has no such mandate lacking
 
02:30:09.710 --> 02:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
that a you there's no utility in New
 
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that could turn around and say
 
02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
I want to build offshore wind so we
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
haven't even got to the step where we
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
would allow that to happen because they
 
02:30:19.389 --> 02:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
don't generate we reregulate we
 
02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
deregulate that now in the case of
 
02:30:23.309 --> 02:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut and other
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
states the um government tells the
 
02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
utility you will negotiate with the
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
offshore wind company and you will enter
 
02:30:32.670 --> 02:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
into a purchase power agreement with
 
02:30:34.590 --> 02:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
them so that's quite a ways down the
 
02:30:36.429 --> 02:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
road from where we are right now that
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't even allow our utilities to do
 
02:30:40.389 --> 02:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
that so I don't think we're cutting
 
02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves out of anything the uh doe
 
02:30:45.070 --> 02:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
Will Keep Us involved through their
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings with uh ISO New England
 
02:30:51.429 --> 02:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
nepool and Nesco as well
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's also worthwhile to point out that
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not the only state
 
02:30:59.230 --> 02:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
that's backing away from offshore wind
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
just today the governor of New Jersey
 
02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
announced that New Jersey is stepping
 
02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
away from offshore wind off the coast of
 
02:31:11.070 --> 02:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
New Jersey they will no longer pursue
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
02:31:14.590 --> 02:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
projects additional comment
 
02:31:17.469 --> 02:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
representative n thank you just to add
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
to what you just said um it was in New
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
Jersey where they had the issue with the
 
02:31:21.720 --> 02:31:23.990 align:start position:0%
Jersey where they had the issue with the
right

02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:31:28.830 --> 02:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
will right uh representative
 
02:31:32.670 --> 02:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
Swanson uh as indicated given that New
 
02:31:35.389 --> 02:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have a mandate to
 
02:31:38.670 --> 02:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
build windmills I am unsure why uh the
 
02:31:41.230 --> 02:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
whole concept of the technology seems to
 
02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
be posing a threat and why we need to
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
change our legislation in order to
 
02:31:51.070 --> 02:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
Simply overly state that we shouldn't be
 
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
pursuing this or at least we shouldn't
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
have uh the structure in place to
 
02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
examine it and so I think I see this as
 
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
anti- business anti- technology and
 
02:32:03.550 --> 02:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
that's really all it's accomplishing I
 
02:32:06.389 --> 02:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
recommend against this additional
 
02:32:09.710 --> 02:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
comment representative McGee um and just
 
02:32:11.950 --> 02:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill um we we talk in
 
02:32:13.870 --> 02:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
generalities a lot because it's a lot
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
shorter to do so so the first section
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
removes um offshore wind uh from the
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
definition in the office of energy
 
02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
Innovation um but then we're also
 
02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
repealing the offshore wind industry
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce Training Center where we were
 
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out whether uh
 
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
universities um and other groups would
 
02:32:38.429 --> 02:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
be trying to get younger people in the
 
02:32:40.750 --> 02:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
workforce trained for those jobs of the
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
future um and you may be able to say
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
well we think that's premature but the
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
third thing it does is it moves the grid
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
modernization advisory company Council
 
02:32:53.469 --> 02:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
into the department of energy and the
 
02:32:55.950 --> 02:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
hydrogen advisory Council into the
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
office of energy Innovation um I would I
 
02:33:02.750 --> 02:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
would argue that having the grid
 
02:33:05.230 --> 02:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
modernization advisory Council become
 
02:33:08.269 --> 02:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
part of the doe removes the transparency
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
that it currently has now similar to the
 
02:33:12.670 --> 02:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and sustainable energy
 
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
board which we have never heard about
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
any activities going on uh the function
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
of that group was absorbed into the
 
02:33:23.110 --> 02:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
Department of energy as well so um I'm
 
02:33:24.429 --> 02:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
going to oppose the bill because there
 
02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
are a number of things that I disagree
 
02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
with and um and I don't believe that we
 
02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
should be putting our heads in the sand
 
02:33:33.309 --> 02:33:33.319 align:start position:0%
at this point we're not committed to
 
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
anything so again um to representative
 
02:33:38.429 --> 02:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
Swanson's point I don't see why we
 
02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
should be threatened by having greater
 
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge we all talk here as though
 
02:33:44.269 --> 02:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
because we had a hearing yesterday we
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
all have knowledge we all have opinions
 
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have knowledge on the subject
 
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
of offshore wind and its viability so
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'll be opposing the
 
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill okay seeing no further discussion
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
needed I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%

04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
4th this is the second half of our
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
session today we heard three bills
 
04:02:31.630 --> 04:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
earlier today and we will he hear three
 
04:02:35.429 --> 04:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
more in the next hour to two and a half
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
hours or hour and a half I should say so
 
04:02:40.510 --> 04:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
the first bill we will hear is House
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 654 FN rela ative to allowing small
 
04:02:45.239 --> 04:02:46.510 align:start position:0%
Bill 654 FN rela ative to allowing small
customer

04:02:46.510 --> 04:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
customer
 
04:02:48.990 --> 04:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
generators the ability to participate in
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
group net
 
04:02:52.990 --> 04:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
metering and following that bill we will
 
04:02:55.710 --> 04:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
hear HB
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%

04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
resiliency and then finally at 2:00 we
 
04:03:09.630 --> 04:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
will hear s
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%

assist clean energy and and resiliency
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as C Pacer so let's open
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
the public hearing right now on House
 
04:03:26.469 --> 04:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
Bill 654 FN and I'll ask representative
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
Kat McGee to introduce this legislation
 
04:03:31.950 --> 04:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
on behalf of representative Tom Corman
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh good good
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee nice
 
04:03:40.429 --> 04:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
to be back in front of you again um HB
 
04:03:40.439 --> 04:03:41.389 align:start position:0%
to be back in front of you again um HB
uh

04:03:41.389 --> 04:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
654 FN um
 
04:03:47.670 --> 04:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
is uh a bill to it's very simple bill it
 
04:03:50.189 --> 04:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
it will allow uh small customer
 
04:03:52.910 --> 04:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
generators the ability to participate in
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
group net metering so um there are three
 
04:03:58.830 --> 04:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
aspects under the analysis that might
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
help you understand the details in the
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
bill um basically currently small
 
04:04:06.910 --> 04:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
customer generators are not allowed to
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
participate in group net metering and so
 
04:04:12.389 --> 04:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
the first point of the bill is to allow
 
04:04:14.349 --> 04:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
group hosts who who are customer
 
04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
generators to form a group with any
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
customer including those customers who
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
are also generating meaning they have
 
04:04:23.790 --> 04:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
solar panels on their house and I I've
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
heard about this issue before and uh I'm
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor on the bill but I've really
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
let Tom take the lead on it because he
 
04:04:34.110 --> 04:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
had been uh approached by a constituent
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
of his who is a former State Rep Linda
 
04:04:40.149 --> 04:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
Tanner who was saying gez you know I I I
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
have solar panels I'd like to
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
participate and I find this an exclusion
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
here that doesn't allow me to become
 
04:04:49.149 --> 04:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
part of a group that is also already net
 
04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
metering and in many cases those are the
 
04:04:53.790 --> 04:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
very people who would like to be
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
participating in sort of pooling power
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and so it seems like the
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
exclusion um isn't really workable so
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
point two is it requires any future
 
04:05:07.510 --> 04:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
Rules by the commission to allow small
 
04:05:10.269 --> 04:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
group small customer generators to be
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
members of a group foret metering
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
and the third part is it requires any
 
04:05:18.269 --> 04:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
agency that issues rules affecting group
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
net metering to also ensure that small
 
04:05:22.510 --> 04:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
customer generators are allowed to be
 
04:05:24.389 --> 04:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
members of a group for the purpose of
 
04:05:24.399 --> 04:05:25.469 align:start position:0%
members of a group for the purpose of
net

04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
net
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
metering so um it's pretty much all
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
focused on the same thing which is sort
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
of removing the Obstacle of allowing
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
somebody who's a small generator to
 
04:05:40.229 --> 04:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
group okay thank you could you say a
 
04:05:47.469 --> 04:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
little bit more about how this would
 
04:05:50.910 --> 04:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
work since a customer
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
generator is someone who is a uh a
 
04:05:59.790 --> 04:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
customer who is generating his own power
 
04:06:02.510 --> 04:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
and probably putting the excess back on
 
04:06:02.520 --> 04:06:04.830 align:start position:0%
and probably putting the excess back on
the

04:06:04.830 --> 04:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:09.630 --> 04:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
grid if that person also becomes a
 
04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
member of a net metering group mhm
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
they would get
 
04:06:20.670 --> 04:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
uh as a member of the group from the
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
group host some power at a discount
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
price so if they're a customer
 
04:06:32.189 --> 04:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
generator net metering and a customer
 
04:06:34.830 --> 04:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
gener customer of a group net metering
 
04:06:37.950 --> 04:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
group wouldn't they be double dipping in
 
04:06:41.149 --> 04:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
a sense and getting double the subsidies
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
I was I was expecting this question um
 
04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
and no one has prepped me for it but I
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
figured that would be one of the things
 
04:06:48.429 --> 04:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
you'd want to look at I think that is
 
04:06:49.870 --> 04:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
not the intent of the bill to allow
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
somebody to to dip in both ways the idea
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
is that uh if a say if a group is
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
forming and somebody is in that area
 
04:07:00.750 --> 04:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
that wants to be part of that group if
 
04:07:02.429 --> 04:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
they're currently net metering they're
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
not allowed to be part of that group
 
04:07:06.269 --> 04:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
because of the way the language is
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
structured in statute so this doesn't
 
04:07:12.389 --> 04:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
allow them to get credit for net
 
04:07:14.670 --> 04:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
metering as an individ idual utility
 
04:07:17.309 --> 04:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
customer and then also get credit for
 
04:07:19.229 --> 04:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
participating in a group net metering
 
04:07:20.910 --> 04:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
project it's not it's not the idea where
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to dip twice the idea is
 
04:07:27.389 --> 04:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
that if they are a small generator they
 
04:07:29.790 --> 04:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
should be able to join a group and
 
04:07:31.630 --> 04:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
participate in that group which means
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
they would be um pooling their energy
 
04:07:36.429 --> 04:07:36.439 align:start position:0%
with the group at least that's my
 
04:07:38.109 --> 04:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
understanding I'm I'm really not you
 
04:07:41.630 --> 04:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
know I didn't research this bill but I'm
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it doesn't allow double
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
dipping cuz I know they've been asking
 
04:07:46.229 --> 04:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
for this under the limited electric
 
04:07:48.750 --> 04:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
energy producers section of Statute for
 
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
a long time there's been a lot of
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
questions around why someone who is has
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
got panels on top of their house can't
 
04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
be part of a group where it would make
 
04:07:59.349 --> 04:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
sense for them to
 
04:08:01.590 --> 04:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
be so we we may be able to get the
 
04:08:03.109 --> 04:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
answer to that question better than I
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
can answer it from so would it be the
 
04:08:09.070 --> 04:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
expectation of this legislation that the
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
commission would adopt a rule that says
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
that if you're a customer generator and
 
04:08:19.870 --> 04:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
you want to become a group net metering
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
group member yeah you have to
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
stop um net metering on your own account
 
04:08:27.870 --> 04:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
I would think it would be calculated one
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
or the other I I don't I don't see how
 
04:08:31.790 --> 04:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
you would be able to double dip but
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody who runs the systems
 
04:08:34.990 --> 04:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to tell you if that would
 
04:08:37.149 --> 04:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
be possible I think they would have to
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
declare themselves part of the group
 
04:08:41.309 --> 04:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
that I think that's that's the point is
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
that the very people who could make up
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
these groups in an organic way are
 
04:08:47.070 --> 04:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
currently prohibited from joining the
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
groups because of the statute I think
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's what it's seeking to solve do you
 
04:08:55.990 --> 04:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
see any language here that lays out that
 
04:08:59.070 --> 04:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
distinction between being a customer
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
generator or being a member of a group
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
rather than and being a member of a
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
group well I think on section three um
 
04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
under 362a colon 9 and it's section um
 
04:09:13.560 --> 04:09:15.109 align:start position:0%
under 362a colon 9 and it's section um
um

04:09:15.109 --> 04:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:18.550 --> 04:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
14 A1 it says a customer generator may
 
04:09:20.670 --> 04:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
elect to become a group host for the
 
04:09:22.189 --> 04:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
purpose of reducing or otherwise
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
controlling the energy costs of a group
 
04:09:24.000 --> 04:09:24.750 align:start position:0%
controlling the energy costs of a group
of

04:09:24.750 --> 04:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:09:27.109 --> 04:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
customers and then there's language in
 
04:09:29.149 --> 04:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
there now that says who are not customer
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
generators so what we're trying to do is
 
04:09:35.710 --> 04:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
not have that be there um except U and
 
04:09:36.910 --> 04:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
then it goes on to say except that a
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
political subdivision as divined in
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
another uh aspect of
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
362 uh or the OWN owner of a facility
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
described in 362
 
04:09:49.870 --> 04:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
a920 that is a customer generator May
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
participate as a group member um so I
 
04:09:56.309 --> 04:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
think I think all they're trying to do
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
you right now there's an exclusion for
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
people who are generating individually
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
and they want to remove that exclusion
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
so they can participate in the group
 
04:10:12.269 --> 04:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
there isn't any language here that
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
explicitly says you can only count the
 
04:10:17.349 --> 04:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
benefits of net metering once but it
 
04:10:19.870 --> 04:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make sense to allow someone to
 
04:10:21.630 --> 04:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
count them twice I I don't think that's
 
04:10:23.229 --> 04:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
the objective of the bill but again
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else can shed more light
 
04:10:25.680 --> 04:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else can shed more light
on

04:10:27.030 --> 04:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:10:31.109 --> 04:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
it do do you have any idea what the
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
rationale behind
 
04:10:36.510 --> 04:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
allowing customer generators to also be
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
in a group what is the rationale behind
 
04:10:42.870 --> 04:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
that well I think groups are generally
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
trying to pull resources and um they
 
04:10:49.790 --> 04:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
they have maybe more power together than
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
separately I I don't know I mean I think
 
04:10:53.550 --> 04:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh many of the groups that are doing
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
that metering now they're they're very
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
different from each other so I I I'm
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
really don't have any expertise on
 
04:11:04.109 --> 04:11:04.119 align:start position:0%
that additional questions U for
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative um McGee representative
 
04:11:10.030 --> 04:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
rals well Mr chair I I don't have a
 
04:11:13.030 --> 04:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
question for representative McGee but I
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
was wanted to ask you the chair if you
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
might allow me to try and help her
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
explain he knows more if I might try to
 
04:11:23.229 --> 04:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
shed a little light for the for the
 
04:11:26.030 --> 04:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
whole committee about group are you a
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill I am not no
 
04:11:32.429 --> 04:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
okay you do have some expertise here
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
though so I will allow you to uh attempt
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
to explain this for us thank you Mr
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and I'll I'll try to be
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
effective OB I try to be brief um
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
metering the reason group net metering
 
04:11:56.429 --> 04:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
exists the requirement
 
04:12:02.189 --> 04:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
to for a single uh let's let's an
 
04:12:04.830 --> 04:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
example one business located in an
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
industrial park okay right one business
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
located in an industrial park has a big
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
building they want to put solar on their
 
04:12:12.960 --> 04:12:14.550 align:start position:0%
building they want to put solar on their
business

04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:12:18.309 --> 04:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
building um they want to put you
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
know uh 500 kilowatts of solar capacity
 
04:12:26.429 --> 04:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
on their
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
building and they're going to net meter
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.510 --> 04:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
grid the the current net the the net
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
metering statute requires that that uh
 
04:12:42.910 --> 04:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
right they're going to send more energy
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
back to the Grid in a year than they
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
than they
 
04:12:50.189 --> 04:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
use the net metering statute requires
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
that the the company that wants to net
 
04:12:56.910 --> 04:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:00.750 --> 04:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
load electric load essentially that
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
would take their electrons in theory
 
04:13:05.710 --> 04:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
right you you can't control where the
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
electrons go
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
but those electrons are going to go onto
 
04:13:13.670 --> 04:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
the grid so the company that wants to
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
net meter has to identify other
 
04:13:18.910 --> 04:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
businesses and they can be anywhere in
 
04:13:20.670 --> 04:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
that Utility Services territory they
 
04:13:23.590 --> 04:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to be adjacent but they often
 
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
are and this might be the same for a
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
town that has multiple buildings that
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
wants to net meter so they they have to
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
basically sign up load to account for
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
the energy that they're going to put
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
so their neighbors neighboring
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
businesses might say okay you can put my
 
04:13:54.670 --> 04:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
business down and here's my load and
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
submit that documentation to the Pu that
 
04:14:01.950 --> 04:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
says now you have enough load signed up
 
04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to take your net metered
 
04:14:06.910 --> 04:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
electricity and that's just the
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
requirement of net metering it's sort of
 
04:14:11.830 --> 04:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
this requirement that in theory we we're
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:18.149 --> 04:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
the businesses who agree to subscribe
 
04:14:21.149 --> 04:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
their load to that group group N meeting
 
04:14:23.149 --> 04:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
project don't necessarily get
 
04:14:26.109 --> 04:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
compensated they might they might get
 
04:14:28.750 --> 04:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
compensated like the the host business
 
04:14:31.590 --> 04:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
might say I'll I'll write you of of my
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
net metering Revenue I'll write you a
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
check each year to sort of pay you for
 
04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
the favor of of being in my group but
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
they might not and in the instance of a
 
04:14:45.149 --> 04:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
town with multiple buildings that are
 
04:14:46.590 --> 04:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
net meeting it wouldn't make any sense
 
04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
the town's not going to pay
 
04:14:52.750 --> 04:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
itself so I I believe that the group the
 
04:14:55.149 --> 04:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
requirement for a group for for net
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
metering is is sort of an accounting
 
04:15:01.510 --> 04:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
exercise where
 
04:15:03.990 --> 04:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
the the the the group members are not
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily being compensated they might
 
04:15:07.870 --> 04:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
like I said if they're separate
 
04:15:11.550 --> 04:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
businesses but they might not um and at
 
04:15:13.710 --> 04:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
any rate the comp compensation that's
 
04:15:15.109 --> 04:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
going to the group
 
04:15:17.870 --> 04:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
members is
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
not additional rayer money it's it's
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
money that the host net
 
04:15:28.469 --> 04:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
meter received for their exported
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
electricity so if he shares that Revenue
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
with his group members it's not
 
04:15:35.950 --> 04:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
additional money so I I
 
04:15:38.469 --> 04:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
believe this sit this bill is attempting
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
to address so you've got five buildings
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
in the industrial park the one puts his
 
04:15:46.309 --> 04:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
big array on he signs up his neighbors
 
04:15:49.229 --> 04:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
for group net metering and it happens
 
04:15:50.750 --> 04:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
the way I
 
04:15:53.550 --> 04:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
said but then a few years later another
 
04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
business wants to put his own solar
 
04:15:58.910 --> 04:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
array on and now he wants to net
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
meter so it it it would U allow that
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
person to do that while still being in
 
04:16:06.870 --> 04:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
the group his load is
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
still part of the
 
04:16:11.109 --> 04:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
load that was subscribed for the
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
original project but but I don't believe
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
there's any double dipping so I hope
 
04:16:19.149 --> 04:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
that was helpful and thank
 
04:16:22.389 --> 04:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
you and the other thing the other ex
 
04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
sorry as I I just want to clarify what
 
04:16:27.870 --> 04:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative rolds was trying to
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
explain so you think that
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation might primarily apply
 
04:16:34.800 --> 04:16:36.510 align:start position:0%
this legislation might primarily apply
to

04:16:36.510 --> 04:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:16:39.710 --> 04:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
situations whereby
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
a a municipal host
 
04:16:43.600 --> 04:16:45.550 align:start position:0%
a a municipal host
was

04:16:45.550 --> 04:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:16:45.560 --> 04:16:47.070 align:start position:0%
was
adding

04:16:47.070 --> 04:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
adding
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
members to its group to satisfy its load
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
obligation in a situation where to to
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
use your example let's say there's a
 
04:17:00.910 --> 04:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
solar array on the town hall and there's
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
library right now the library couldn't
 
04:17:10.109 --> 04:17:10.119 align:start position:0%
be part of the
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
group according to statute but if this
 
04:17:15.269 --> 04:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
law if we were to adopt this legislation
 
04:17:17.229 --> 04:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
the library could be part of the group
 
04:17:18.790 --> 04:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
is that what you're
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
saying yes okay that's clarification
 
04:17:24.670 --> 04:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
that's good and I just give a little bit
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
more on that as well the bill itself
 
04:17:29.990 --> 04:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
does Define small customer generators as
 
04:17:31.710 --> 04:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
a generator whose maximum total
 
04:17:33.630 --> 04:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
generating capacity is not more than 100
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
kilowatts so it you know it it it's very
 
04:17:40.109 --> 04:17:40.119 align:start position:0%
constrained in terms of those very small
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
generators can also be part of groups
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
and um I think you can derive a lot of
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
benefit if you have a lot of people who
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
are doing rooftop solar and putting them
 
04:17:50.590 --> 04:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
together I know we had seen
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
presentations on Virtual power plants
 
04:17:54.229 --> 04:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing of being able to
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
pull it together and then say what is
 
04:17:58.030 --> 04:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
the load here that can be deployed and
 
04:18:01.109 --> 04:18:01.119 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing um and I think often
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
times this type of thing where you're
 
04:18:04.990 --> 04:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
taking the sort of the many and trying
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
to make it into something larger that
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
can be deployed or used um there's a
 
04:18:14.189 --> 04:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
benefit as well to resil
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
um so they may maybe they'll invest in
 
04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
batteries and that kind of thing so that
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
they can deploy a certain amount of
 
04:18:20.590 --> 04:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
energy onto the system if it's needed
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so it's it's just a
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
tool really um representative Swanson
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
has a question yes thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:18:33.189 --> 04:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
representative McGee what I'll do is
 
04:18:36.510 --> 04:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'll frame this as this question in a
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
context okay and that may be U easier to
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
understand and maybe somebody who might
 
04:18:46.229 --> 04:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
step up to field this might be better be
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
able to do this but I'll put this out
 
04:18:50.590 --> 04:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
there because it's in the realm of my
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
experience to uh when when you install a
 
04:18:56.670 --> 04:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh solar system and you want net
 
04:19:00.109 --> 04:19:00.119 align:start position:0%
metering you pay the utility company to
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
come in and remove your existing meter
 
04:19:05.710 --> 04:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
and replace it with a net meter so there
 
04:19:10.590 --> 04:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
is a cost with doing that and uh so in
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
my experience I had to you know pay them
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
to come in put in a net meter for my
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
house to accommodate the solar
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
generation so uh there I've and for this
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
example I see a scenario that this would
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
apply to because I think many of us have
 
04:19:28.269 --> 04:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
seen condos in which there is a separate
 
04:19:30.510 --> 04:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
meter for each unit in the condo say a
 
04:19:34.149 --> 04:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
four condo house or something like that
 
04:19:36.550 --> 04:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
so there are four separate meters now
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm living in that house or building and
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
I think it' be good to switch to solar
 
04:19:44.349 --> 04:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
but you know I'm looking at maybe just
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
1/4 of all the rooftops to put solar
 
04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
panels on uh but if I get together with
 
04:19:53.710 --> 04:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
the other people in there uh who each
 
04:19:56.429 --> 04:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
have their own meter uh collectively we
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
might say hey let's go to the power
 
04:20:01.149 --> 04:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
company and say let's just get you know
 
04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
because every solar installation has a a
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental built-in cost and it's
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
better if you do it all at once on a
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
given building rather than coming back
 
04:20:12.429 --> 04:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
multiple times we might get together and
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
say well let's collaborate and uh we'll
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
replace our meters with a single net
 
04:20:21.389 --> 04:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
meter and we'll all get solar panels and
 
04:20:24.189 --> 04:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
is that kind of the scenario that this
 
04:20:24.199 --> 04:20:25.710 align:start position:0%
is that kind of the scenario that this
would

04:20:25.710 --> 04:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
support I don't know okay no I mean I
 
04:20:32.469 --> 04:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
think I think I think it could the
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
definition of of a small generator
 
04:20:37.149 --> 04:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
though is below the 100 kilowatt so it
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
certainly could but um but yeah okay
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
well thank you and maybe somebody else
 
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
can it's good scenario come up a bad
 
04:20:47.630 --> 04:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
scenario thank you representative MC
 
04:20:51.149 --> 04:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative Matson just for
 
04:20:55.630 --> 04:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you just for
 
04:20:57.750 --> 04:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
clarification so if all these little
 
04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
small customers join together then I'm
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
sure they're going to be over 100
 
04:21:05.550 --> 04:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours doesn't that change their
 
04:21:07.149 --> 04:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
where they fall in the grid I mean in
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
the no because that would be the group
 
04:21:12.750 --> 04:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so they're they're being being
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to join a group as a member if
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
they are under 100 kilowatt so they can
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
throw their 100 kilow towards a larger
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
um group that then can you know wield
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
additional power
 
04:21:30.510 --> 04:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that's the whole point is
 
04:21:30.520 --> 04:21:32.670 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that's the whole point is
that

04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
um they they can maximize the power yeah
 
04:21:38.109 --> 04:21:38.119 align:start position:0%
you answered the question yep okay any
 
04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none let's call
 
04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
up next Matt Young from the Department
 
04:21:45.910 --> 04:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
of energy to give us the Department's uh
 
04:21:54.830 --> 04:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
legislation good afternoon Mr Young and
 
04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
welcome good afternoon Mr
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
04:22:04.269 --> 04:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Matt Young and
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
I'm attorney at the New Hampshire
 
04:22:06.429 --> 04:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:22:10.429 --> 04:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
energy um the department is neutral on
 
04:22:13.710 --> 04:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
HB 654 as introduced but the department
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
does have some
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
concerns um so first uh I think I'll
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
start uh with sort of the 30,000 foot um
 
04:22:25.229 --> 04:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
consideration for this committee I think
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh the the proposed changes in HB 654 uh
 
04:22:31.269 --> 04:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
do seem to violate I guess the uh what
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
I'll call the original intent of the
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
group host
 
04:22:37.710 --> 04:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
designation the group host designation
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
was intended to permit the group host to
 
04:22:43.309 --> 04:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
share any surplus power um with other
 
04:22:45.149 --> 04:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
utility account holders who were not
 
04:22:48.550 --> 04:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
customer generators so that so that
 
04:22:50.550 --> 04:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
those customers uh could benefit from
 
04:22:53.429 --> 04:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
the proceeds of renewable energy um the
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
group host rather than a member uh was
 
04:22:57.269 --> 04:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
intended to be the owner of that
 
04:22:59.309 --> 04:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
renewable energy facility so the
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
language included in this bill is
 
04:23:04.389 --> 04:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
obviously um kind of in in conflict with
 
04:23:05.950 --> 04:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
that uh perceived
 
04:23:08.189 --> 04:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
intent and
 
04:23:11.830 --> 04:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
then next moving on to I guess more the
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
more um
 
04:23:16.109 --> 04:23:16.119 align:start position:0%
maybe practical uh implementation
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
concerns which the committee may want to
 
04:23:21.550 --> 04:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
consider um so having customer
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
generators as group members would uh in
 
04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
the Department's uh opinion greatly
 
04:23:30.189 --> 04:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
complicate utility and Department
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
registration and administration of these
 
04:23:35.550 --> 04:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
groups um so for example um this
 
04:23:37.630 --> 04:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
language does permit a group host uh who
 
04:23:39.510 --> 04:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
is a customer generator to be a host
 
04:23:42.750 --> 04:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
themselves um which would complicate the
 
04:23:44.910 --> 04:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
financial and energy usage accounting
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
which we sort of briefly just discussed
 
04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and similar to what the chairman uh
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
had raised and which we just discussed
 
04:23:59.070 --> 04:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
um the department was concerned with the
 
04:24:02.229 --> 04:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
double dipping issue um and I guess I
 
04:24:04.229 --> 04:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
will note uh for the chairman that I did
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
on my outline use the technical term
 
04:24:10.189 --> 04:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
double dipping as well um and what
 
04:24:13.469 --> 04:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
we we we do see a scario
 
04:24:16.710 --> 04:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
where customer generators could get paid
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
as they normally would under that
 
04:24:21.389 --> 04:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
alternative tariff and also receive
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
benefits as a member um as
 
04:24:25.870 --> 04:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds said it is um at
 
04:24:29.070 --> 04:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
the group host discretion um so there
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
there really could be a scenario where
 
04:24:33.550 --> 04:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
the member customer generator is
 
04:24:36.420 --> 04:24:36.430 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits from both both
 
04:24:36.430 --> 04:24:37.630 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits from both both
[Music]

04:24:37.630 --> 04:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.760 --> 04:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:50.149 --> 04:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
and I I believe it was discussed that it
 
04:24:53.149 --> 04:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
was um it it it may not end up falling
 
04:24:55.950 --> 04:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
on rate payers um I I I think that based
 
04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
on conversations with the utilities and
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
other net metering um issues that uh
 
04:25:07.389 --> 04:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
this um this bill may have implications
 
04:25:12.590 --> 04:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
for uh um billing and um other
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
accounting practices of the utilities
 
04:25:17.790 --> 04:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
that would maybe require an upgrade to a
 
04:25:19.790 --> 04:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
um to their to their billing systems
 
04:25:21.389 --> 04:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
which which cost would ultimately get P
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the rate
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
payers and then finally uh which I think
 
04:25:28.510 --> 04:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
I'll note you know maybe is more of a
 
04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
technical fix um if this was not the
 
04:25:34.830 --> 04:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislation line 17 does
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
state that the uh Public Utilities
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
Commission shall adopt rules to ensure
 
04:25:41.109 --> 04:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
that small customer generators are
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate as members of
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
group net metering
 
04:25:49.950 --> 04:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
and since the um sort of the the split
 
04:25:51.309 --> 04:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
of the and the creation of the
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the department of
 
04:25:54.429 --> 04:25:54.439 align:start position:0%
energy is responsible for developing net
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
metering rules pursuant to
 
04:26:01.109 --> 04:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
362a n and we are actually in the middle
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
of developing those rules um so I would
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
just note that for the committee as
 
04:26:10.870 --> 04:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
well so um in a nutshell I guess um it
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't entirely clear to the Department
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
what the intended benefits of this bill
 
04:26:18.670 --> 04:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
are financially or otherwise and whether
 
04:26:21.870 --> 04:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
they do outweigh um any of these
 
04:26:25.229 --> 04:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
aforementioned concerns um but that
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
being said if the committee does decide
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
to move forward uh with this bill the
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
department would be happy to work with
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature on that and with that
 
04:26:37.030 --> 04:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
I will be happy to try and answer any
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much
 
04:26:41.590 --> 04:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
excellent information appreciate you
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
sharing that with us questions
 
04:26:43.680 --> 04:26:44.830 align:start position:0%
sharing that with us questions
representative

04:26:44.830 --> 04:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:26:46.670 --> 04:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:26:48.269 --> 04:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking a question I'm just
 
04:26:49.710 --> 04:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
trying to walk through the scenario a
 
04:26:51.109 --> 04:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
little bit so I can see if what what
 
04:26:55.149 --> 04:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
this bill would do so we have um someone
 
04:26:57.070 --> 04:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
who's already a group so there's
 
04:26:58.870 --> 04:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
presumably there's a host there that's
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
producing renewable energy on a larger
 
04:27:04.990 --> 04:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
scale than the 100 kilowatts or what is
 
04:27:07.469 --> 04:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
100 kilowatts so they're maybe they're
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
producing you know 800 Kow or larger and
 
04:27:14.229 --> 04:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
they s that back to the utility the
 
04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
excess but they have agreements with
 
04:27:20.030 --> 04:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
load other load entities that say I want
 
04:27:22.030 --> 04:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
I'll take credit for so much of this
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
power and someone else take credit for
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
so much of this power and presumably
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
they may or may not enter into a
 
04:27:29.389 --> 04:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
financial relationship on that
 
04:27:31.229 --> 04:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
so I would assume they're doing it
 
04:27:32.590 --> 04:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
because they're going to save money but
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
that would only make common sense so now
 
04:27:37.070 --> 04:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a new entity come in
 
04:27:38.990 --> 04:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
which would be a small customer
 
04:27:41.550 --> 04:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
generator producing less than 100
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
kilowatt and then they would become part
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
of that group so with what they net
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
meter would that go back to the host and
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
go out through his accounting uh stuff
 
04:27:58.710 --> 04:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
and be credited to the load uh entities
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
that he's got a contract with or would
 
04:28:02.710 --> 04:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
they continue to net meter as they had
 
04:28:05.550 --> 04:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
been in the past and just net meter it
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
out but then when they bought power like
 
04:28:11.070 --> 04:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
at night they or whenever um they would
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
buy it from as part of the group that's
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to figure out that's a
 
04:28:17.070 --> 04:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
great question um representative and
 
04:28:18.750 --> 04:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
it's not really clear how that would
 
04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
work out one of our one of the other
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
considerations um was whether these new
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
um customer generator members how their
 
04:28:30.750 --> 04:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
load would be attributed to the group is
 
04:28:33.670 --> 04:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
it if if they're net metering is it is
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
it the net from that and is it the net
 
04:28:38.429 --> 04:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
after they're netted through the Tariff
 
04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
U the alternative tariff in that or is
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
it just their their total usage um it's
 
04:28:48.030 --> 04:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
not clear followup followup because my
 
04:28:49.229 --> 04:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
my issue there is with just kind of what
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
you're saying it seems as if you could
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
start out with the group being let's say
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
800 kilowatt generator and then you
 
04:28:59.070 --> 04:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
could add I don't know 10 15 100
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
kilowatt uh net meter to that and so
 
04:29:03.870 --> 04:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
actually the net metering total would
 
04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
become more than the total for the for
 
04:29:08.830 --> 04:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
the original group so I don't know
 
04:29:10.630 --> 04:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
whether they would be able if they would
 
04:29:12.309 --> 04:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
but put some of that back through the
 
04:29:15.269 --> 04:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
for the group and and have load entities
 
04:29:16.870 --> 04:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
to buy it and some would be just net
 
04:29:19.710 --> 04:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
metered to the utility it's just doesn't
 
04:29:21.149 --> 04:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
seem to be any definition of that am I
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
missing something no I um I would agree
 
04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's probably some clarification that
 
04:29:27.109 --> 04:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
need to be done and and I think I would
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
add to that if
 
04:29:32.189 --> 04:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
um there doesn't seem to be any limiting
 
04:29:34.349 --> 04:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
language in this in terms of if there's
 
04:29:37.630 --> 04:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
a customer generator member who's in a
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
group theoretically there could then be
 
04:29:42.590 --> 04:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
another that customer generator member
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
could be a host for other members and
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
then does it kind of where does that end
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
to and the complexity is
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
just so just to clarify what you just
 
04:29:56.990 --> 04:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
said so you're talking about overlapping
 
04:30:00.670 --> 04:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
groups correct okay thank you uh
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:30:03.359 --> 04:30:06.229 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
question

04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:30:09.630 --> 04:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a a clarifica a
 
04:30:11.469 --> 04:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
clarification question would you want
 
04:30:14.030 --> 04:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
like to take that one
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
first yes let's take the clarification
 
04:30:19.590 --> 04:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
question first representative McGee
 
04:30:22.429 --> 04:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I have notes here
 
04:30:25.309 --> 04:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
um that rep representative Corman placed
 
04:30:30.109 --> 04:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
um for some clarification that under pu
 
04:30:32.830 --> 04:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
90220 large customer generator means a
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
customer generator whose facility has a
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
total maximum generation capacity
 
04:30:39.950 --> 04:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
greater than 100 KW um alternating
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
current up to and including one megawatt
 
04:30:44.429 --> 04:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
specified what a large generator would
 
04:30:49.950 --> 04:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
be like it can't be add infin item I
 
04:30:52.990 --> 04:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
guess um and it also specifies currently
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
what a sort of what a member is in those
 
04:30:56.990 --> 04:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
rules pu
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
90222 a member means a customer of the
 
04:31:02.910 --> 04:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
same distribution utility as the host
 
04:31:04.990 --> 04:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
who signs an agreement to be a member of
 
04:31:09.149 --> 04:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
the group under RSA 362 A9 and who
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
remains a customer of the same
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
distribution utility as the host during
 
04:31:16.229 --> 04:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
its membership to the group and accept
 
04:31:18.630 --> 04:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh as provided in pu
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
90216 who is not a customer generator so
 
04:31:23.830 --> 04:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
there's the there's the exemption that
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
they would like to have
 
04:31:25.760 --> 04:31:27.269 align:start position:0%
they would like to have
Rewritten

04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
Rewritten
 
04:31:30.870 --> 04:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
um so they'd like to change the last
 
04:31:36.149 --> 04:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
Clause to uh pu 90222 reading who is not
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
a large customer generator yeah
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
so those are his notes that you you know
 
04:31:45.309 --> 04:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
he did the research I don't just reading
 
04:31:48.670 --> 04:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
them Wendy Thomas has a question thank
 
04:31:51.429 --> 04:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
you um thank you for being here um one
 
04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
of your points in your testimony is you
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
said that there are implications for the
 
04:31:57.309 --> 04:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
utilities for billing and other
 
04:31:59.590 --> 04:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
accounting systems indicating that that
 
04:32:02.349 --> 04:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
might be an obstacle um can you tell me
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
in your discussions have you figured out
 
04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
is this because they don't have the
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
current capability to do this or is this
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:14.159 --> 04:32:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:19.630 --> 04:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
um I was in my testimony I was trying to
 
04:32:22.830 --> 04:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
speculate that um you know since this is
 
04:32:24.710 --> 04:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
this would require probably new changes
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
to their billing systems just based on
 
04:32:27.870 --> 04:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
the accounting that would be required
 
04:32:30.590 --> 04:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
for it so it's sort of speculation that
 
04:32:32.670 --> 04:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
it would probably require
 
04:32:37.149 --> 04:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
new upgrades to those systems um that
 
04:32:40.149 --> 04:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
would I would I would assume cost have a
 
04:32:43.469 --> 04:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
cost to them so we could defer that
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
question to Mr Lata who probably can
 
04:32:53.070 --> 04:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.710 --> 04:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
followup okay further questions
 
04:32:57.790 --> 04:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
representative Summers thank you Mr
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
chairman just a quick question just to
 
04:33:00.510 --> 04:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
clarify you might have St at the
 
04:33:03.109 --> 04:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
beginning but um what is the position
 
04:33:07.029 --> 04:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
the doe has has um where do you stand on
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 654 we're neutral on this bill
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we want
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
to thank you for being here to give us
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
the Department's take on this
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
legislation final pink guard is for
 
04:33:29.789 --> 04:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.750 --> 04:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
back good afternoon uh Michael lado
 
04:33:43.869 --> 04:33:43.879 align:start position:0%
representing ever energy again uh
 
04:33:45.949 --> 04:33:45.959 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
before you uh we do have uh concerns
 
04:33:55.470 --> 04:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
with the bill as written um in the sort
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
of the first issue is uh we we do agree
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
with the Department of energy that the
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
proposed language as written um is
 
04:34:09.310 --> 04:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat counter to the original purpose
 
04:34:12.310 --> 04:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
of group net metering so uh as has been
 
04:34:14.349 --> 04:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
discussed the idea behind group net
 
04:34:16.109 --> 04:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
metering is that you would have
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
customers who are unable to participate
 
04:34:21.070 --> 04:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
in the net metering program whether
 
04:34:24.390 --> 04:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's a residential customer whose roof
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
is shaded or facing the wrong way or uh
 
04:34:29.789 --> 04:34:29.799 align:start position:0%
someone who lives in an apartment
 
04:34:31.910 --> 04:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
building or we talked a lot about
 
04:34:34.029 --> 04:34:34.039 align:start position:0%
Condominiums this morning but for
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they could not site a
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
distributed generation resource at their
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh at their home or business uh and so
 
04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
could not participate in group net
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
metering therefore sorry could not
 
04:34:48.429 --> 04:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
participate in metering therefore group
 
04:34:51.629 --> 04:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
net metering was created to allow uh a
 
04:34:55.109 --> 04:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
large uh net metering installation large
 
04:34:58.590 --> 04:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
solar installation to share the benefits
 
04:35:01.629 --> 04:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
of that uh net metering with those
 
04:35:03.990 --> 04:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
customers who again for whatever reason
 
04:35:05.789 --> 04:35:05.799 align:start position:0%
their property would not allow them to
 
04:35:09.310 --> 04:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
participate in net metering um we do
 
04:35:12.029 --> 04:35:12.039 align:start position:0%
read the bill uh in a similar way that I
 
04:35:13.709 --> 04:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
think representative Vose and and
 
04:35:15.070 --> 04:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGee had a back and
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
forth on that it would allow customers
 
04:35:20.470 --> 04:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
small customer generators who
 
04:35:23.629 --> 04:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
participate in net metering on their own
 
04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
to also participate in group net
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
metering uh so again this is a customer
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
who has solar on their we'll just say
 
04:35:36.269 --> 04:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
house they are participating in net
 
04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
metering they are receiving credits uh
 
04:35:40.470 --> 04:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
for their exports through the net
 
04:35:42.189 --> 04:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
metering program
 
04:35:46.349 --> 04:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
and they would also now under this uh be
 
04:35:48.429 --> 04:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate in group net
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
metering and receive presumably uh
 
04:35:55.470 --> 04:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
compensation or or exports uh
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
compensation from the exports of the
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
group from the group host um we do have
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
concerns with that both administratively
 
04:36:07.390 --> 04:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
as well as uh in terms of the accounting
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
um I understand just based upon the
 
04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
testimony today that PO that wasn't the
 
04:36:15.189 --> 04:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
intent of of the bill sponsor of the
 
04:36:18.551 --> 04:36:18.561 align:start position:0%
bill uh but from a utility imple
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
implementation standpoint uh that would
 
04:36:24.070 --> 04:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
be very hard for us to administer and
 
04:36:29.310 --> 04:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
provide those credits back to uh uh the
 
04:36:31.830 --> 04:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
customer generator who is net metered
 
04:36:35.429 --> 04:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
but also a member of the group uh and so
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh I did uh have conversations with our
 
04:36:40.629 --> 04:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
team about uh you know billing systems
 
04:36:43.310 --> 04:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
and administration and um they did
 
04:36:45.390 --> 04:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
confirm that our billing systems would
 
04:36:47.709 --> 04:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
not be able to accommodate that as they
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
are currently structured uh and quite
 
04:36:52.510 --> 04:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
frankly they're not sure utility billing
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
systems by and large uh could do it it
 
04:36:59.189 --> 04:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
would require uh essentially complete
 
04:37:01.830 --> 04:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
manual intervention for us to do it so
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
someone would physically be working off
 
04:37:08.070 --> 04:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
of a spreadsheet taking um uh data out
 
04:37:09.910 --> 04:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
of our Billing System applying it
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
through a spreadsheet and then manually
 
04:37:14.590 --> 04:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
applying it to uh to customer bills
 
04:37:17.551 --> 04:37:17.561 align:start position:0%
which obviously increases our costs
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
which would be passed along to customers
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
but also um you know we always have a
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
concern that the more manual
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
intervention that we have the
 
04:37:27.789 --> 04:37:27.799 align:start position:0%
possibility for for human error uh
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
exists so th those are the concerns uh
 
04:37:33.629 --> 04:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
with the bill and happy to answer
 
04:37:36.830 --> 04:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
have okay thank you questions for
 
04:37:43.230 --> 04:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
eversource repres resentative Harrington
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:37:46.349 --> 04:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
question I'm just trying to figure how
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
this thing would play out and it seems
 
04:37:49.070 --> 04:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
like there's there's two types of
 
04:37:51.990 --> 04:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
scenarios the group net metering is
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
allowed up to a megawatt so say if we
 
04:37:55.949 --> 04:37:55.959 align:start position:0%
had a group net metering that was close
 
04:37:59.470 --> 04:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
to a megawatt the small generator uh net
 
04:38:02.830 --> 04:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
metering is less than 100 megawatts if
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
kilowatts I'm sorry sorry thank you that
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
would be a heal big small generator but
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
um so but this would allow multiple
 
04:38:12.750 --> 04:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
small generators to join that group so
 
04:38:15.629 --> 04:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
in effect the net output of that group
 
04:38:17.789 --> 04:38:17.799 align:start position:0%
when you considered it just as all the
 
04:38:20.429 --> 04:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
entities put together could be 14 could
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
be well over a megawatt could be one and
 
04:38:25.029 --> 04:38:25.039 align:start position:0%
a half megawatts 1.6 megawatts which
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
sort of would seem to violate the whole
 
04:38:30.070 --> 04:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
concept of keeping it capit at megawatt
 
04:38:34.349 --> 04:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
either that or the some of the small
 
04:38:37.070 --> 04:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
generators that join once they hit the
 
04:38:39.709 --> 04:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
one megawatt level would then revert
 
04:38:42.869 --> 04:38:42.879 align:start position:0%
back to becoming individual net meters
 
04:38:44.910 --> 04:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
and so they wouldn't affect double dip I
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
don't see I think this's I don't see
 
04:38:49.551 --> 04:38:49.561 align:start position:0%
another option so I I I would interpret
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
it differently which is um the group
 
04:38:59.470 --> 04:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
host uh and and you know everyone who is
 
04:39:03.429 --> 04:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
not uh a municipal host is allowed to
 
04:39:05.830 --> 04:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
net meter up to one megawatt the
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
differential between the small customer
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
generator under 100kw and the large
 
04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
customer generator is financial uh it's
 
04:39:17.709 --> 04:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
it's what um uh compensation they get
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
from the utility uh so the large
 
04:39:22.109 --> 04:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
customer generator only gets the supply
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
rate versus the small customer generator
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
gets um portions of uh transmission and
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
distribution so
 
04:39:36.551 --> 04:39:36.561 align:start position:0%
as I think we would look at it um it the
 
04:39:38.550 --> 04:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
small customer generator who was
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
participating in a group would not be
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
additive to the group host you have a
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
group host they have a facility that
 
04:39:51.150 --> 04:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
operates up to a certain um kilowatt or
 
04:39:55.230 --> 04:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
or megawatt level uh and they are
 
04:39:58.590 --> 04:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
sharing the benefits of their exports
 
04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
with the members of their group this
 
04:40:04.270 --> 04:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
would add to it that the members of
 
04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
their group could have their own
 
04:40:11.350 --> 04:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
solar uh and be participating as a and
 
04:40:14.190 --> 04:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
separately be um part of the net
 
04:40:18.390 --> 04:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
metering program but I I don't think
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
what it would be additive to the group
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
host because that's uh facility specific
 
04:40:26.000 --> 04:40:27.830 align:start position:0%
host because that's uh facility specific
so

04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:31.470 --> 04:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
yeah followup rep followup before you do
 
04:40:33.550 --> 04:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
that though representative McGee I'd
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
remind you that um you need to get my
 
04:40:39.628 --> 04:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
attention and permission before you
 
04:40:39.638 --> 04:40:42.070 align:start position:0%
attention and permission before you
speak

04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:40:43.628 --> 04:40:43.638 align:start position:0%
so it's just so I get this clear what
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that once that one
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap was reached whether it was
 
04:40:50.590 --> 04:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
by the group host by itself or with the
 
04:40:52.830 --> 04:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
group host with the addition of some new
 
04:40:54.788 --> 04:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
small generators that would be the
 
04:40:57.628 --> 04:40:57.638 align:start position:0%
maximum any further small generators
 
04:40:59.550 --> 04:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
that were in the in that added to that
 
04:41:02.190 --> 04:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
group would basically they wouldn't be
 
04:41:04.590 --> 04:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
there I mean they would act as regular
 
04:41:06.150 --> 04:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
net meter as because they couldn't
 
04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
exceed the one megawatt Gap
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
so my reading of it is is that the small
 
04:41:15.868 --> 04:41:15.878 align:start position:0%
G Customer generators are participating
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
as members not as a component of the
 
04:41:23.470 --> 04:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
host and so therefore their uh the size
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
of their solar would not be added to the
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
host size so it wouldn't be you have a
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
host it's a um you know a a a certain
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
number and then you you would add stack
 
04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
on top of that the small customer
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
generators they would only be the small
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
customer generators under the bill would
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
only be participating as takers not um
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
producers they would still get um
 
04:41:55.150 --> 04:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
compensation under net metering for
 
04:41:57.430 --> 04:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
their experts but that would be separate
 
04:42:00.750 --> 04:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
and distinct from uh for the purposes of
 
04:42:06.350 --> 04:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
Arrangement and is it also not true that
 
04:42:13.948 --> 04:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
the way group net metering is structured
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
the the total load for the host the
 
04:42:22.510 --> 04:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
group net host has to match the load
 
04:42:24.350 --> 04:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's accepted by the members of the
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
group at the end of the year otherwise
 
04:42:32.510 --> 04:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
the group host uh has to Forfeit some of
 
04:42:34.830 --> 04:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
his net metering benefits is that
 
04:42:37.150 --> 04:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
correct so so that's that is correct
 
04:42:40.390 --> 04:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
that the the host Arrangement has to
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
account for all of the their exports and
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
again if you think about having small
 
04:42:49.788 --> 04:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
customers small customer generators
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me being part of that group host
 
04:42:55.470 --> 04:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
Arrangement their load is going to be
 
04:42:58.110 --> 04:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
variable and that's where the challenges
 
04:43:00.910 --> 04:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
with the accounting come in you know can
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
we account for um and right now the onus
 
04:43:08.350 --> 04:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
is on the group host to account for all
 
04:43:10.110 --> 04:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
of their export and they make that
 
04:43:12.510 --> 04:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
certification to to the Department of
 
04:43:15.150 --> 04:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
energy now we have customer generators
 
04:43:16.628 --> 04:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
who would be part small customer
 
04:43:18.310 --> 04:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
generators who would be participating
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
and obviously there's variability in
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
their load and Export that could impact
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
those host
 
04:43:28.948 --> 04:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
arrangements so if I understood you
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
correctly in addition to this being a
 
04:43:34.750 --> 04:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
billing challenge for a utility this
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
would also be a an accounting challenge
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
for the Department of energy trying to
 
04:43:42.030 --> 04:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
manage these
 
04:43:46.350 --> 04:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
groups and account for
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
their uh imports and exports to their
 
04:43:51.708 --> 04:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
group members yeah which have to be Tred
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
up at the end of the year right yeah I I
 
04:43:55.628 --> 04:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
believe the I heard the department of
 
04:43:57.670 --> 04:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
energy testify concerns about the
 
04:44:01.948 --> 04:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
accounting okay thank you further
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative reels thank you
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I um I I genuinely want to
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
ask you if I
 
04:44:16.510 --> 04:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
was correct earlier when
 
04:44:21.070 --> 04:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
I told everyone here that the in a group
 
04:44:21.080 --> 04:44:21.830 align:start position:0%
I told everyone here that the in a group
net

04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
net
 
04:44:21.840 --> 04:44:23.708 align:start position:0%
net
metering

04:44:23.708 --> 04:44:23.718 align:start position:0%
metering
 
04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
situation the compensation that the
 
04:44:26.798 --> 04:44:28.510 align:start position:0%
situation the compensation that the
group

04:44:28.510 --> 04:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
group
 
04:44:30.430 --> 04:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
members may
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
get uh comes
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
from the group
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
host and is
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
is not not
 
04:44:46.910 --> 04:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
provided by the utility is that correct
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
so a group host is compensated by the
 
04:44:56.070 --> 04:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
utility for their exports yes uh they
 
04:44:59.230 --> 04:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
can either we can either write them a
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
check uh or we can do on bill crediting
 
04:45:06.788 --> 04:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
for the members of their group so I I
 
04:45:09.868 --> 04:45:09.878 align:start position:0%
think the point that you're making that
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
if I may large larger generator um and I
 
04:45:17.430 --> 04:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
elect to participate in net metering I'm
 
04:45:20.430 --> 04:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
going to receive compensation if I'm a
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
the same generator and I elect to uh be
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
a group host and now we're assigning the
 
04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
values to um to the members of that
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
group it doesn't really change the
 
04:45:35.670 --> 04:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
initial level of compensation you're
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
still would have been compensated for
 
04:45:41.788 --> 04:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
your exports that I I agree with
 
04:45:43.948 --> 04:45:43.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:45:47.070 --> 04:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I want
 
04:45:49.470 --> 04:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
to thank you for testifying here and I
 
04:45:51.628 --> 04:45:51.638 align:start position:0%
want to uh because I have no more pink
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
cards I want to close the public hearing
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 654
 
04:45:59.470 --> 04:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
FN and immediately turn
 
04:46:01.948 --> 04:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
to uh House Bill
 
04:46:04.590 --> 04:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
541 establishing a committee to study
 
04:46:06.590 --> 04:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
energy and Telecommunications
 
04:46:08.430 --> 04:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Sur
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
survivability and resiliency
 
04:46:13.628 --> 04:46:13.638 align:start position:0%
so I am going to open that public
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
hearing and I have no pink cards at the
 
04:46:18.868 --> 04:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
moment but I
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the bill sponsor who is
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh standing right before the table is
 
04:46:29.548 --> 04:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
going to be available to introduce this
 
04:46:32.548 --> 04:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
legislation so I'm going to call
 
04:46:36.670 --> 04:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
on representative McFarland to introduce
 
04:46:38.350 --> 04:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
541 that's a good guess Michael in the
 
04:46:42.350 --> 04:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
pink should be working its way around to
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
you uh good morning Mr chairman
 
04:46:45.150 --> 04:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
honorable members of committee I'm
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative Donald McFarland from
 
04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
Orange I thank you for the opportunity
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 541 this
 
04:46:54.390 --> 04:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
testimony represents My Views and the
 
04:46:56.190 --> 04:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
views and interests of my constituents
 
04:46:59.150 --> 04:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
in graft and 18 my testimony is not made
 
04:47:00.788 --> 04:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
on behalf of any private employer nor
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
should it be construed to represent the
 
04:47:04.590 --> 04:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
views of any of my
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
employers House Bill 541 before you uh
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
proposes the establishment of a
 
04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
committee to study the
 
04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
survivability and the resiliency of New
 
04:47:16.548 --> 04:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energy and
 
04:47:16.558 --> 04:47:18.110 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energy and
Telecommunications

04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications
 
04:47:20.190 --> 04:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and I I'm not going to
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
insult your intelligence by reading out
 
04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
the bill I know you can can read what's
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
in there so let me tell you a little bit
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
about why I'm putting this before the
 
04:47:30.670 --> 04:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh recent disclosures have
 
04:47:33.190 --> 04:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
highlighted significant nation state
 
04:47:34.990 --> 04:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
physical and cyber threats targeting our
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
critical infrastructure Nationwide New
 
04:47:41.708 --> 04:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not immune to those risks
 
04:47:45.070 --> 04:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
and I I'll make a few comments about the
 
04:47:46.590 --> 04:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
the bill itself and the committee that
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
it seeks to establish in a second but
 
04:47:51.590 --> 04:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
let me give you some context around that
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's been a raft of commentary in the
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
media uh such as this quote I was I was
 
04:47:58.030 --> 04:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a number of quotes and a
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
number of Articles earlier today in
 
04:48:02.510 --> 04:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
preparation for this and one guy said we
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
are in a new Cold War the PRC as the
 
04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
enemy and we must treat them as such Why
 
04:48:10.548 --> 04:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
are we seeing those quotes made if we
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
look to the opinion of some experts who
 
04:48:15.788 --> 04:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
are in a position to know I would cite
 
04:48:19.390 --> 04:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
an newberger and I don't regard this by
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
the way as a partisan bill I hope that
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
none of you does uh an if you're not
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with who she is served as the
 
04:48:28.910 --> 04:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
deputy National Security adviser for
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
cyber and emerging Technologies in the
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration uh and assumed that
 
04:48:36.990 --> 04:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
role in 2021 having a distinguished
 
04:48:40.030 --> 04:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
career in some of our security agencies
 
04:48:41.830 --> 04:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
and she resigned from that position in
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
the last month nevertheless in December
 
04:48:47.708 --> 04:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
she explained that once Chinese hackers
 
04:48:49.868 --> 04:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
had infiltrated our telecommunications
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
network uh networks in in a recent
 
04:48:54.590 --> 04:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
breach which I'll come back to uh they
 
04:48:57.548 --> 04:48:57.558 align:start position:0%
had achieved Broad and full access to
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
our citizens data allowing them to
 
04:49:02.670 --> 04:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
geolocate millions of individuals and
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
record phone calls at will I'm referring
 
04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
to a breach that has been well
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
publicized since September
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the Wall Street Journal and in
 
04:49:16.270 --> 04:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
other media uh referred to as salt
 
04:49:18.590 --> 04:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
typhoon uh this breach was publicly
 
04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledged by the FBI in November and
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at the September article in
 
04:49:26.910 --> 04:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
the Wall Street Journal uh I will quote
 
04:49:29.470 --> 04:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
from that very briefly if I may last
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
week us officials said they had
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
disrupted a network of more than 200,000
 
04:49:36.548 --> 04:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
routers cameras and other Internet
 
04:49:38.948 --> 04:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
connected consumer devices that served
 
04:49:40.830 --> 04:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
as an entry point into US Network works
 
04:49:42.510 --> 04:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
for a china-based hacking group called
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
flax typhoon and in January Federal
 
04:49:47.470 --> 04:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
officials disrupted Vault typhoon yet
 
04:49:49.548 --> 04:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
another China link campaign that has
 
04:49:52.350 --> 04:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
sought to quietly infiltrate a swath of
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
us critical infrastructure the Cyber
 
04:49:56.830 --> 04:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
threat posed by the Chinese government
 
04:49:59.110 --> 04:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
is massive said Christopher Ray the
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
FBI's director speaking earlier this
 
04:50:03.548 --> 04:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
year at a security conference in Germany
 
04:50:05.948 --> 04:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
China's hacking program is larger than
 
04:50:07.750 --> 04:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
that of every other major Nation
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
combined US security officials allege
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
that Beijing has tried and at times
 
04:50:15.310 --> 04:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
succeeded in borrowing deep into US
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
critical infrastructure networks ranging
 
04:50:20.190 --> 04:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
from water treatment systems to airports
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
and oil and gas pipelines now what I
 
04:50:23.230 --> 04:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
just read to you from that September
 
04:50:25.590 --> 04:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
article was not about the salt typhoon
 
04:50:27.788 --> 04:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
breach it was about the history that we
 
04:50:31.708 --> 04:50:31.718 align:start position:0%
have seen in recent months uh of other
 
04:50:34.750 --> 04:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
activity certainly we've seen activity
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
from other state actors uh and we've
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
seen activity from uh criminals for the
 
04:50:42.910 --> 04:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
usual purposes that they pursue things
 
04:50:45.628 --> 04:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
but what we're seeing here uh does in
 
04:50:48.670 --> 04:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
fact represent a sea change at the end
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
of last year the executive director of
 
04:50:53.628 --> 04:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
us cyber command had this to say let's
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
not hide he said the simple fact that we
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
have uncovered and exposed multiple
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
People's Republic of China Global cyber
 
04:51:03.270 --> 04:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
operations and he went on to explain
 
04:51:05.948 --> 04:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
that we've seen a shift from PRC cyber
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
operations targeting our defense
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
industrial base and conducting large
 
04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
scale intellect ual property theft to a
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
new modus operandi about which he
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
concluded the PRC is executing a global
 
04:51:21.390 --> 04:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
cyber campaign targeting
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
telecommunications Cloud critical
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and our defense industry
 
04:51:27.868 --> 04:51:27.878 align:start position:0%
to gain a military and technological
 
04:51:30.270 --> 04:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
advantage in preparation for times of
 
04:51:32.990 --> 04:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
Crisis or conflict with the us and our
 
04:51:35.868 --> 04:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
allies it's important to step back from
 
04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
Individual incidents and understand the
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
gravity of the combined events and so I
 
04:51:43.110 --> 04:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
I think I've uh given you some
 
04:51:45.110 --> 04:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
indications as to why I consider this to
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
be an important bill I'm happy to follow
 
04:51:49.390 --> 04:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
up with the committee and share articles
 
04:51:51.548 --> 04:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
and other information with you but back
 
04:51:54.990 --> 04:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
to the the commit the bill itself uh I
 
04:51:57.990 --> 04:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that you understand the
 
04:52:00.788 --> 04:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
economic and Public Safety implications
 
04:52:03.548 --> 04:52:03.558 align:start position:0%
of disruptions to our energy and
 
04:52:05.310 --> 04:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications infrastructure and I
 
04:52:07.150 --> 04:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
submit to you that there are also
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
significant National Defense
 
04:52:11.230 --> 04:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
implications and when you take that uh
 
04:52:14.788 --> 04:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
into consideration uh with the the other
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
Uh current events that we have observed
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh I believe you will understand why
 
04:52:21.670 --> 04:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
this committee is warranted as to the
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
structure of the committee I could
 
04:52:25.470 --> 04:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
readily be persuaded that this should in
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
fact be a study commission not a study
 
04:52:29.910 --> 04:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
committee as many of you will appreciate
 
04:52:31.750 --> 04:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh with the back and forth with OS over
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
the holidays and and their uh volume of
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
work I was not able to achieve precisely
 
04:52:38.110 --> 04:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
the draft that I might have sought I
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
defer to the committee as to the best
 
04:52:42.510 --> 04:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
way to move forward with the bill uh but
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
I would say that by supporting this we
 
04:52:46.590 --> 04:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
take a significant step towards securing
 
04:52:48.670 --> 04:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
our state's critical infrastructure and
 
04:52:50.708 --> 04:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee to favorably
 
04:52:52.230 --> 04:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
consider this bill and recommend its
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
passage thank you for your time and
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you for introducing
 
04:53:04.590 --> 04:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation could you uh just give
 
04:53:07.750 --> 04:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
us a quick uh idea of your background I
 
04:53:09.510 --> 04:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe you have a cyber security
 
04:53:12.270 --> 04:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
background that is true Mr chairman I
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
have uh spent a great many years of my
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
life focused on telecommunications and
 
04:53:19.548 --> 04:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
cyber security and information
 
04:53:22.510 --> 04:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
technology in one way or another I I uh
 
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I just turned 50 recently and I can
 
04:53:27.390 --> 04:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
tell you that I have over 40 years
 
04:53:29.910 --> 04:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
playing around with uh uh telecoms and
 
04:53:32.990 --> 04:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
cyber um some of which were on my own
 
04:53:35.470 --> 04:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
dime as a kid operating a bulletin board
 
04:53:37.470 --> 04:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
and many of which have been more
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
recently uh being paid to do that work
 
04:53:42.510 --> 04:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh how however as I said at the start uh
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not here on behalf of any of my
 
04:53:47.868 --> 04:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
employers I'm here uh representing my my
 
04:53:50.350 --> 04:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
passion and my interest in securing our
 
04:53:53.590 --> 04:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
nation and making sure that uh we are
 
04:53:55.868 --> 04:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
giving proper attention to what I think
 
04:53:57.470 --> 04:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
is an important concern I know it's a
 
04:54:00.548 --> 04:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
concern that is something that we expect
 
04:54:03.788 --> 04:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
to see addressed in Washington DC um but
 
04:54:06.670 --> 04:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
I do also think that it is a concern
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
that appropriately should be the subject
 
04:54:12.990 --> 04:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:15.150 --> 04:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
I guess what I was trying to establish
 
04:54:18.030 --> 04:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
is that since this is
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
a a
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
vocational uh you have the vocational
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
background to understand the seriousness
 
04:54:29.708 --> 04:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:33.150 --> 04:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
threats is that what prompted you to
 
04:54:35.230 --> 04:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
submit this leg legislation you think
 
04:54:38.750 --> 04:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
there is some some significant threat
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
out there that we should be looking at
 
04:54:43.708 --> 04:54:43.718 align:start position:0%
I I'll answer that in two ways Mr
 
04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
chairman I think first of all that um
 
04:54:50.750 --> 04:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
the words that I quoted from uh an no
 
04:54:53.670 --> 04:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
Berger and from uh the the executive
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
director of us cyber command who's
 
04:54:57.510 --> 04:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually a guy called Morgan adamsky are
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
two of many that I could have quoted
 
04:55:02.788 --> 04:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
from who are far better placed than I am
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
to aine on the immediacy of the threat
 
04:55:09.548 --> 04:55:09.558 align:start position:0%
and the Strategic importance of the
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
threat what what I can comment on is
 
04:55:16.948 --> 04:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
that this is something that we should be
 
04:55:20.590 --> 04:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
prepared for and when I think about our
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
technology policy and our energy policy
 
04:55:26.030 --> 04:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I am as you've
 
04:55:28.750 --> 04:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
heard me testify on other bills I am
 
04:55:32.030 --> 04:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
keenly interested in achieving cheap and
 
04:55:35.070 --> 04:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
reliable energy but as I present this
 
04:55:37.708 --> 04:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
bill to you I suggest to you that
 
04:55:40.548 --> 04:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
reliability is not the only concern and
 
04:55:42.510 --> 04:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
we should be keenly interested in
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not we are creating a grid
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
and creating uh the the utility
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that is needed for it to
 
04:55:54.510 --> 04:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
be survivable and resilient in the event
 
04:55:54.520 --> 04:55:58.590 align:start position:0%
be survivable and resilient in the event
of

04:55:58.590 --> 04:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
conflict okay let's uh have some
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
questions from representative Harrington
 
04:56:06.750 --> 04:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
first um you know reading your bill I
 
04:56:08.510 --> 04:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
understand that you've uh concisely put
 
04:56:09.948 --> 04:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
out that there a huge problem we're
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
dealing with I just I wonder what is
 
04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
that a group of uh New Hampshire State
 
04:56:17.548 --> 04:56:17.558 align:start position:0%
reps and a couple of other people going
 
04:56:21.030 --> 04:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
to do to address this hugely complicated
 
04:56:23.670 --> 04:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
and you know phenomena that's well well
 
04:56:25.230 --> 04:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of New Hampshire I
 
04:56:27.190 --> 04:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
mean I don't see that we're going to be
 
04:56:29.628 --> 04:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
able to produce anything
 
04:56:31.548 --> 04:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
usable it's a great question
 
04:56:34.110 --> 04:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
representative and I think that uh
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason I was alluding
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
to maybe this should be a commission not
 
04:56:40.708 --> 04:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
a committee I think that this is a topic
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
that we should be monitoring on an
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis and uh we should be
 
04:56:49.230 --> 04:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
staying AB breast of uh developments in
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
Washington as well as uh in the Press um
 
04:56:55.868 --> 04:56:55.878 align:start position:0%
I do believe that state and local
 
04:56:57.548 --> 04:56:57.558 align:start position:0%
government has a role to play in the
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
response and to that extent I think it's
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
warranted for um this legislature to be
 
04:57:06.030 --> 04:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
aware of these issues and to monitor
 
04:57:08.548 --> 04:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
them and to consider uh what what policy
 
04:57:11.310 --> 04:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
actions or other um actions we may want
 
04:57:14.910 --> 04:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
to recommend um I don't however think to
 
04:57:17.150 --> 04:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
your point that this is something that
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to uh do like a
 
04:57:22.548 --> 04:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
oneandone look at later in the year and
 
04:57:23.990 --> 04:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
then close the committee and be done
 
04:57:26.548 --> 04:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
with it for the foreseeable
 
04:57:30.030 --> 04:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
future representative McGee thank you Mr
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
04:57:34.750 --> 04:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
mcfallen for being here again um my
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
question is along the same lines as
 
04:57:37.948 --> 04:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's because as I
 
04:57:40.830 --> 04:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
look at how the bill is actually written
 
04:57:45.270 --> 04:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
um I think the makeup is fairly narrow
 
04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
for such a broad topic but I also see
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
the turnaround time oftentimes these
 
04:57:52.548 --> 04:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
bills are not signed into law until June
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
and then if you have 45 minutes to have
 
04:57:57.628 --> 04:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
your first meeting you're talking July
 
04:57:59.590 --> 04:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
and the report is due not even four
 
04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
months later on a huge topic so I was
 
04:58:01.680 --> 04:58:02.590 align:start position:0%
months later on a huge topic so I was
just

04:58:02.590 --> 04:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:58:05.590 --> 04:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you would consider
 
04:58:08.390 --> 04:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
modifying this because um if it does
 
04:58:10.310 --> 04:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
need serious consideration and potential
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
even ongoing
 
04:58:15.230 --> 04:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
consideration um it needs a begin date
 
04:58:18.750 --> 04:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe even an end date and also uh
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
some real thought around how long it
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
would take for us to get anything that's
 
04:58:22.948 --> 04:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
really worthwhile or
 
04:58:27.430 --> 04:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:29.868 --> 04:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
right representative Summers has a
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:58:34.150 --> 04:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
you representative McFarland for taking
 
04:58:36.510 --> 04:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
my question I appreciate that you or
 
04:58:38.788 --> 04:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
have a background in in cyber security
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm very interested in have
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
background as well um this bill this
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
commission or committee excuse me would
 
04:58:48.270 --> 04:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
something would take effect as I know
 
04:58:50.830 --> 04:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
that uh there's an issue with Huawei
 
04:58:53.190 --> 04:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
wireless access points for example B all
 
04:58:55.470 --> 04:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
the way down I25 right by our Minuteman
 
04:58:58.948 --> 04:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
silos Southwest um would this study is
 
04:59:02.110 --> 04:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
something like as if a the government
 
04:59:04.510 --> 04:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
purchasing it on the cheap WWE let's say
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
for example Huawei Wi-Fi devices by sebr
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
something like that would that would
 
04:59:12.670 --> 04:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
that be covered with this committee so I
 
04:59:14.350 --> 04:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
think the short answer to your question
 
04:59:17.430 --> 04:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative is yes uh it certainly
 
04:59:18.708 --> 04:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
could fall within the purview of the
 
04:59:20.948 --> 04:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
committee I will say to you by way of
 
04:59:24.190 --> 04:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
example um and I I assure you I don't
 
04:59:25.430 --> 04:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
have any shares in the Wall Street
 
04:59:27.628 --> 04:59:27.638 align:start position:0%
Journal but but I will cite them again
 
04:59:28.990 --> 04:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
for no better reason than that's what I
 
04:59:31.830 --> 04:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
was looking at earlier uh in December uh
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
in a Wall Street Journal article um it
 
04:59:37.350 --> 04:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
was talking about a a slightly different
 
04:59:39.070 --> 04:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
problem than the Huawei uh problem it
 
04:59:41.110 --> 04:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
was talking about some consumer routers
 
04:59:42.670 --> 04:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
it was talking about Soho routers in in
 
04:59:45.310 --> 04:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
your uh houses and and and you know your
 
04:59:47.548 --> 04:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
homes and offices uh and it said the
 
04:59:49.030 --> 04:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
defense department earlier this year
 
04:59:50.750 --> 04:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
opened an investigation into National
 
04:59:52.750 --> 04:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
Security vulnerabilities in Chinese
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
routers according to people familiar
 
04:59:56.030 --> 04:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
with the matter uh the house select
 
04:59:57.548 --> 04:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
committee on the Chinese Communist party
 
04:59:59.708 --> 04:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
in August urged the Commerce Secretary
 
05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
to investigate TP Link because it
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
presents an unusual degree of
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities um and I could go on but
 
05:00:09.628 --> 05:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
I I the point that I'm making there is I
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
think we know that there is a supply
 
05:00:16.430 --> 05:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
chain concern that is Broad and um I
 
05:00:18.670 --> 05:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
I've seen commentary around for example
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
the attempt by uh HP and and Juniper
 
05:00:24.548 --> 05:00:24.558 align:start position:0%
emerge and some commentary around that
 
05:00:27.070 --> 05:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
and and uh Huawei and look I I don't
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
want to um give you my thoughts on that
 
05:00:32.350 --> 05:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's tangential to the issue at
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
hand but what isn't tangential to the
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
issue at hand is that the more that we
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
create this supply chain risk uh into
 
05:00:45.150 --> 05:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
are not just uh generating uh plant and
 
05:00:47.830 --> 05:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
and grid but even right into people's
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
houses uh and meters and and all these
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
end points um and I know we' have an
 
05:00:56.110 --> 05:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
interest in this committee on you know
 
05:00:57.548 --> 05:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
things like solar that are heavily
 
05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
distributed and there's a lot of
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
technology in that you know there's all
 
05:01:03.788 --> 05:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh I I don't want to use the
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
word unforeseen because I think there
 
05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
are some of us who who certainly have
 
05:01:09.070 --> 05:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
talked about these risks for a long time
 
05:01:11.230 --> 05:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
but there are there are ramifications
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
that uh need to be thought about
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:21.510 --> 05:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
elements next um representative Swanson
 
05:01:22.470 --> 05:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
has a
 
05:01:25.070 --> 05:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
you for your time representative
 
05:01:31.708 --> 05:01:31.718 align:start position:0%
McFarland uh I do not follow nearly as
 
05:01:34.750 --> 05:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
closely uh probably the media that you
 
05:01:38.430 --> 05:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
have and but I am aware I believe that
 
05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
not only China but other nation state
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
actors are interested in getting into
 
05:01:46.750 --> 05:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
these places so I I share your concerns
 
05:01:49.948 --> 05:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
as in be afraid be very afraid kind of a
 
05:01:54.510 --> 05:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
thing and so but my question is it this
 
05:01:56.910 --> 05:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
U maybe a two-prong question the scope
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
seems very large and there seems to be a
 
05:02:02.788 --> 05:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
need to accomplish this that you would
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
have to have some very knowledgeable
 
05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
people investigate the installation of
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
the equipment in each of these centers
 
05:02:13.788 --> 05:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
or you know these these nodes in this
 
05:02:16.190 --> 05:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
Communications Network as well as what's
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
provided and I'm glad that you did not
 
05:02:20.830 --> 05:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
include all residential installations
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh but uh I'm I'm trying to
 
05:02:28.510 --> 05:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
gather is was it in your intent that is
 
05:02:30.628 --> 05:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
that this is what a commission would do
 
05:02:32.670 --> 05:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
is just contact
 
05:02:37.390 --> 05:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
every uh facility or installation or a
 
05:02:40.548 --> 05:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
business as far as how they their it
 
05:02:44.190 --> 05:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is set up and then advise
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
the state about the vulnerabilities they
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
have I should think that for example
 
05:02:49.470 --> 05:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
there's uh I think the federal
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
government has something called sisa
 
05:02:56.270 --> 05:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
that provides advisories to uh anyone
 
05:02:58.110 --> 05:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
with an IT infrastructure and anybody
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's a large organization is going to
 
05:03:02.750 --> 05:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
have its own it department just as you
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
know as the state does so uh what added
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
value would you provide in addition to
 
05:03:11.708 --> 05:03:11.718 align:start position:0%
what kind of invas or um I I wouldn't
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
say Invasion but uh information that you
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
would be gathering for from these
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
organizations to report
 
05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
on thank you so I I think there's quite
 
05:03:23.868 --> 05:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
a few questions wrapped up in there so
 
05:03:26.150 --> 05:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
apologies if I don't get all of them and
 
05:03:28.430 --> 05:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
feel free to tell me I missed something
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
um what I would say first of all is I I
 
05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
don't want anyone to come away from this
 
05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
thinking that um I I am uh trying to
 
05:03:39.788 --> 05:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
paint a a picture of of uh this being
 
05:03:42.910 --> 05:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
being a a terrible circumstance um what
 
05:03:46.070 --> 05:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
I am trying to do is focus on
 
05:03:48.150 --> 05:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
preparedness right I have great
 
05:03:50.788 --> 05:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
confidence in our current Administration
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
and its ability to uh not um end up with
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
you know bringing us into to war and and
 
05:04:00.670 --> 05:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
creating other uh adverse circumstances
 
05:04:02.510 --> 05:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the near future and I think that
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
gives us a period of time in which we
 
05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
can focus sensibly on whether there is
 
05:04:10.628 --> 05:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
something to to be done here and what
 
05:04:12.868 --> 05:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
that is to be done to your point about
 
05:04:14.788 --> 05:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
the different threat actors you're
 
05:04:17.110 --> 05:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely right we see a number of
 
05:04:19.070 --> 05:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
different uh actors including a number
 
05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
of different nation states such as Iran
 
05:04:24.910 --> 05:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
such as Russia um such as North Korea
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
who continue to act uh in in ways that
 
05:04:32.430 --> 05:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
are detrimental to our interests um I
 
05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
think we could have an interesting
 
05:04:36.708 --> 05:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
debate around whether we've seen the
 
05:04:39.788 --> 05:04:39.798 align:start position:0%
same sea change from any of those uh
 
05:04:42.150 --> 05:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
actors that we have seen in the case of
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
china that I was just citing um but
 
05:04:47.230 --> 05:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not that is true if we do the
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
work for one it should be adequate unto
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
all um and so I think to your question
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know I think you asked me what I
 
05:04:58.070 --> 05:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
plan on doing uh in this committee look
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
I this is not about me this is not about
 
05:05:02.910 --> 05:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
any one person um this is about whether
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
we as a state as we're in other bills
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
before this committee setting our energy
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
policy and
 
05:05:13.230 --> 05:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
influencing the private sector that you
 
05:05:16.470 --> 05:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
talk about in how they plan on working
 
05:05:19.030 --> 05:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
within the state uh it's about making
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we are giving due
 
05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
consideration not only to the absolute
 
05:05:27.868 --> 05:05:27.878 align:start position:0%
economic efficiency of Our Generation uh
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
and grid infrastructure and
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications infrastructure but
 
05:05:33.708 --> 05:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
whether we are also contemplating
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
whether what what is being achieved
 
05:05:39.750 --> 05:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
there uh is focusing adequately on all
 
05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
of the the elements that you spoke about
 
05:05:44.990 --> 05:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
that end up creating a survivable and
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
resilient infrastructure and so when I
 
05:05:49.830 --> 05:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
look at the amount of of money that is
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
spent by some of the the companies in
 
05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
the energy sector and in the
 
05:05:58.708 --> 05:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
telecommunication sector on it security
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
and I compare that to other Industries
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not prepared with specific
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
numbers before this committee but I can
 
05:06:07.350 --> 05:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
tell you that I I I understand there to
 
05:06:12.628 --> 05:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:14.830 --> 05:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
discrepancy representative Howard you
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:06:20.670 --> 05:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so I
 
05:06:22.430 --> 05:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
was just curious because I know that
 
05:06:25.150 --> 05:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about foreign actors
 
05:06:27.470 --> 05:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
but would this committee or commission
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
look at the weatherization uh of this
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
type of infrastructure weatherization
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
you said yes I I mean I I can't off the
 
05:06:37.708 --> 05:06:37.718 align:start position:0%
top of my head see how that would be
 
05:06:41.390 --> 05:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
Jermaine okay all right thank you
 
05:06:43.190 --> 05:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas has a question thank
 
05:06:45.070 --> 05:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:06:47.548 --> 05:06:47.558 align:start position:0%
question so um I'm not sure I'm asking
 
05:06:50.708 --> 05:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
the question um obviously this is an
 
05:06:50.718 --> 05:06:52.270 align:start position:0%
the question um obviously this is an
important

05:06:52.270 --> 05:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
concern Nationwide and I do mean
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
Nationwide so is your bill um supposing
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
or or proposing that right now the state
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
is not looking into any potential
 
05:07:10.470 --> 05:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
threats of cyber secur whatsoever and
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
there's nobody out there that's looking
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
into it and secondly uh does not the
 
05:07:18.150 --> 05:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
state uh would not the state be
 
05:07:20.510 --> 05:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
coordinating with the Department of uh
 
05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security on because these
 
05:07:24.910 --> 05:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
issues are widespread right wouldn't
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
they be receiving warnings on these
 
05:07:28.470 --> 05:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
things yeah great questions I I think
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
first of all of course I'm not saying
 
05:07:32.190 --> 05:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
that we are not already doing a great
 
05:07:34.628 --> 05:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
deal in this direction um what I am
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
saying is that uh we have seen uh in
 
05:07:40.990 --> 05:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
some of those events that I was alluding
 
05:07:42.990 --> 05:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
to uh we have
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
seen a change in behavior of some of
 
05:07:49.868 --> 05:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
these thread actors that
 
05:07:53.230 --> 05:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
uh plenty of folks consider meaningful
 
05:07:56.270 --> 05:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
in the ways that I outlined and
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
therefore I think in addition to the
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
status quo uh which includes as you say
 
05:08:06.548 --> 05:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh activity by the DHS and activity by
 
05:08:08.430 --> 05:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
our state cyber security committee and
 
05:08:11.628 --> 05:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
so forth um I think that it is incumbent
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
upon this committee to take account of
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh these factors in as I was alluding to
 
05:08:22.628 --> 05:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
in my answer to representative Swanson
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh in how we attend to uh for example
 
05:08:29.070 --> 05:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
energy policy and uh policy with the the
 
05:08:30.590 --> 05:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
telecommunications companies in the
 
05:08:33.708 --> 05:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
state and what I see is I see that we
 
05:08:37.390 --> 05:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
have uh some companies represented in
 
05:08:40.030 --> 05:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
our state serving our citizens who are
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
large entities who are going to be well
 
05:08:46.910 --> 05:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
tied in to um the the activities at the
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
national level and then we have some
 
05:08:52.548 --> 05:08:52.558 align:start position:0%
smaller uh entities that uh are likely
 
05:08:54.590 --> 05:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
able to be you know deriving benefit
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
from uh what we might do at the state
 
05:08:59.788 --> 05:08:59.798 align:start position:0%
level to support them uh and and I think
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
in either case I come back to my my
 
05:09:06.990 --> 05:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
answer of are we in any legislation that
 
05:09:07.000 --> 05:09:07.868 align:start position:0%
answer of are we in any legislation that
we

05:09:07.868 --> 05:09:07.878 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
contemplate are we making making sure to
 
05:09:15.150 --> 05:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
preference survivability and and
 
05:09:19.150 --> 05:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:22.430 --> 05:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
reliability followup thank you for for
 
05:09:26.750 --> 05:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
the followup so there so um are you
 
05:09:28.910 --> 05:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
implying that this committee or
 
05:09:28.920 --> 05:09:30.470 align:start position:0%
implying that this committee or
commission

05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:09:33.270 --> 05:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
would say for instance be calling in the
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security and the
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
state cyber security people to have them
 
05:09:40.628 --> 05:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
come down and tell you tell the
 
05:09:42.510 --> 05:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
committee what's going on and and to be
 
05:09:45.070 --> 05:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
advised of of any new threats coming so
 
05:09:47.708 --> 05:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
that you could uh have seminars or or
 
05:09:49.390 --> 05:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
something like that is is that what
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're implying with this I I think let
 
05:09:56.190 --> 05:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
me answer that question broadly if I may
 
05:09:58.628 --> 05:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
um because I I I'll interpret that
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
question as what do you think that the
 
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
Practical work of the committee would
 
05:10:06.310 --> 05:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
be um and and I don't presume to answer
 
05:10:08.590 --> 05:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
that wholly but I will say that I think
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
it is appropr rate to see whether or not
 
05:10:15.470 --> 05:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
the utility companies that are the the
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
key utility companies serving our state
 
05:10:23.190 --> 05:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh are themselves well prepared uh and
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
what their point of view is around these
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
issues and depending upon the responses
 
05:10:31.390 --> 05:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
that we might receive from each of them
 
05:10:32.948 --> 05:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
it would then inform I think in a
 
05:10:35.670 --> 05:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
meaningful way the committee as to what
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
else and from whom else it sought to
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
take testimony but I certainly agree
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
that there are um experts that it would
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
be useful to seek testimony from in
 
05:10:50.628 --> 05:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:53.190 --> 05:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative Wendy
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um I actually
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
have two questions but I'll do it one at
 
05:11:01.190 --> 05:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
a time um we're currently seeing a large
 
05:11:04.190 --> 05:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
cyber security breach in DC so would
 
05:11:06.150 --> 05:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
this committee you keep talking about
 
05:11:08.548 --> 05:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
Chinese and other states would this
 
05:11:14.628 --> 05:11:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
domestic so I I think your question
 
05:11:20.390 --> 05:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
again is is in some ways similar to
 
05:11:22.390 --> 05:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative Swanson's question about
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
are there multiple thread actors I think
 
05:11:25.948 --> 05:11:25.958 align:start position:0%
we all understand that there are
 
05:11:27.590 --> 05:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
different people doing different things
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
and some of them may be um you know a
 
05:11:33.310 --> 05:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
kid in in the the basement of their
 
05:11:36.830 --> 05:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
parents' house and others may be uh
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
10,000 um well funded uh agents in a
 
05:11:46.030 --> 05:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
building in Beijing um But whichever of
 
05:11:48.310 --> 05:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
those you are or anywhere in between
 
05:11:51.030 --> 05:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
what I would hope is that we give due
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
consideration to is there anything that
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
that we ought to consider and that we
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
ought to do in order to protect uh and
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
prepare our state and the answer to that
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
by the way might be no right we may very
 
05:12:09.788 --> 05:12:09.798 align:start position:0%
well find to representative Thomas's
 
05:12:12.270 --> 05:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
question that we believe that this is
 
05:12:14.110 --> 05:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
already well attended to in other ways
 
05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
in other places I do think however that
 
05:12:19.910 --> 05:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
if we decide uh as an output of this
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee that there is specific policy
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations to be made that those
 
05:12:26.230 --> 05:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations should be
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations that help us defend
 
05:12:33.788 --> 05:12:33.798 align:start position:0%
against all enemies and uh do so you
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
know all all serious enemies that we
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
consider to be a serious threat and that
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
do so without regard to any one um uh
 
05:12:45.390 --> 05:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
particular uh source and the reason I
 
05:12:47.350 --> 05:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
say that is not simply what we just laid
 
05:12:48.750 --> 05:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
out that there are multiple threat
 
05:12:51.628 --> 05:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
actors out there it's also that it's not
 
05:12:56.230 --> 05:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
adequate to say we are defending
 
05:12:59.548 --> 05:12:59.558 align:start position:0%
against uh a threat that is is from one
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
known location we we have you know
 
05:13:03.270 --> 05:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
you're broadening the question and
 
05:13:04.590 --> 05:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
talking about what's going on in DC I'll
 
05:13:06.350 --> 05:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
talk about what's going on in the nation
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
we have a bunch of uh immigrants
 
05:13:12.270 --> 05:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh in this nation who are here legally
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
and who we are very happy to see here
 
05:13:17.470 --> 05:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
and I I am one of those who's proud and
 
05:13:20.230 --> 05:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
and delighted to be a US citizen now we
 
05:13:22.910 --> 05:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
also have seen a bunch of illegal
 
05:13:26.430 --> 05:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
immigration coming across the border and
 
05:13:29.350 --> 05:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
there are those who would assert that
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
there's pre-staging of individuals in
 
05:13:34.548 --> 05:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
this country who can take action in the
 
05:13:36.990 --> 05:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
Physical Realm so I I think when you ask
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
me how should we be cont lating this and
 
05:13:42.548 --> 05:13:42.558 align:start position:0%
what should the output be yes it should
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
be something that is not focused on any
 
05:13:47.310 --> 05:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
one geographical region followup follow
 
05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
up um so thank you for that answer um
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
bills are always put forward with an
 
05:13:56.670 --> 05:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
intention of some kind of an
 
05:13:59.350 --> 05:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
outcome where is this committee heading
 
05:14:01.390 --> 05:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
and can you give me some specific
 
05:14:04.470 --> 05:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
examples of legislation that may come
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
out of this
 
05:14:08.750 --> 05:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee I I would prefer not to only
 
05:14:10.548 --> 05:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
because because I think that I don't
 
05:14:12.430 --> 05:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
want to prejudge I think the whole point
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
of having a committee is to hear
 
05:14:16.390 --> 05:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and form an objective
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint and I would hate to color that
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
with my personal opinion I think the
 
05:14:23.310 --> 05:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
most important thing this committee
 
05:14:26.070 --> 05:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
could do is solicit uh testimony from
 
05:14:29.548 --> 05:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
experts as I mentioned earlier thank you
 
05:14:29.558 --> 05:14:31.708 align:start position:0%
experts as I mentioned earlier thank you
representative

05:14:31.708 --> 05:14:31.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:14:36.510 --> 05:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you chair uh so you've uh
 
05:14:39.868 --> 05:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
articulated many cyber security threats
 
05:14:42.788 --> 05:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
but as I read the bill it's much broader
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
and potentially uh uh investigation of
 
05:14:50.030 --> 05:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
threats to the grid and its need for
 
05:14:52.350 --> 05:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
hardening could be con considered by
 
05:14:55.390 --> 05:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
this committee do I have that right or
 
05:14:58.270 --> 05:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
have I misgauged the scope no I I think
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
you're exactly right representative and
 
05:15:03.030 --> 05:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
what was going through my mind when I
 
05:15:05.708 --> 05:15:05.718 align:start position:0%
wrote that language uh was that there is
 
05:15:07.390 --> 05:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
a physical element as I was alluding to
 
05:15:08.948 --> 05:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
with representative Thomas there is a pH
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
physical element to these threats we
 
05:15:13.310 --> 05:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
have seen I think um I may get this
 
05:15:15.190 --> 05:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
wrong I think it was North Carolina we
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
saw in the last year or two where there
 
05:15:19.868 --> 05:15:19.878 align:start position:0%
was attacks on uh some of the
 
05:15:22.430 --> 05:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
substations uh we've seen the same in
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
California um and we know that the lead
 
05:15:30.190 --> 05:15:30.200 align:start position:0%
time for for example a new Transformer
 
05:15:31.628 --> 05:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
uh if it's one of these complicated
 
05:15:31.638 --> 05:15:32.868 align:start position:0%
uh if it's one of these complicated
distribution

05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
05:15:34.868 --> 05:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
Transformers at one point I was seeing
 
05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
it advertised as two three maybe 5 years
 
05:15:39.070 --> 05:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
I believe it to be more in the order of
 
05:15:41.708 --> 05:15:41.718 align:start position:0%
decade or more uh for the lead time for
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
some of these big transformers when you
 
05:15:46.350 --> 05:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
look at that when you look at the uh the
 
05:15:48.190 --> 05:15:48.200 align:start position:0%
physical protection of of a few chain
 
05:15:50.548 --> 05:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
link fences that we have around some of
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
those important facilities and you look
 
05:15:55.590 --> 05:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
at the the ways in which a threat actor
 
05:15:58.190 --> 05:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
would think about taking action uh I
 
05:16:00.190 --> 05:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
think you know as I I alluded to earlier
 
05:16:02.670 --> 05:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
the question of are we spending the
 
05:16:05.948 --> 05:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
right proportion of revenues on physical
 
05:16:08.190 --> 05:16:08.200 align:start position:0%
and cyber security and and yes I'm
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
putting physical in the front there uh
 
05:16:14.310 --> 05:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:17.430 --> 05:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
sir representative schneller has a
 
05:16:19.910 --> 05:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman Vos and
 
05:16:21.270 --> 05:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland uh I've heard
 
05:16:27.070 --> 05:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
some things a little bit specific like
 
05:16:29.350 --> 05:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
you you did mention H Packard Enterprise
 
05:16:31.548 --> 05:16:31.558 align:start position:0%
Juniper and then sort of begged off of
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
that as a subject um and then this
 
05:16:38.030 --> 05:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislation appears to be more broadly
 
05:16:38.040 --> 05:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
legislation appears to be more broadly
oriented

05:16:39.910 --> 05:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
oriented
 
05:16:41.948 --> 05:16:41.958 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering is this something
 
05:16:44.270 --> 05:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
that requires
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
leadership uh and a role more from the
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
executive branch than it should and uh
 
05:16:51.750 --> 05:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
should be from the
 
05:16:54.430 --> 05:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
legislature I would just say to you as I
 
05:16:56.470 --> 05:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned to the committee upfront that
 
05:17:00.110 --> 05:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
the particular form if there is you know
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
a recommendation for passage here the
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
particular form of of what it is that we
 
05:17:06.548 --> 05:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
put into place is something that I defer
 
05:17:09.910 --> 05:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
to your joint expertise as to what makes
 
05:17:10.868 --> 05:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
the most
 
05:17:14.070 --> 05:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
sense thank
 
05:17:16.590 --> 05:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions I
 
05:17:18.230 --> 05:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for introducing this
 
05:17:19.868 --> 05:17:19.878 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'll call up Michael
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
Lana from ever Source thank you Mr
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:39.708 --> 05:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
perspective afternoon uh thank you again
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
Michael Lata representing eversource
 
05:17:45.350 --> 05:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
energy um I just want to start off by
 
05:17:48.150 --> 05:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
saying I I very much appreciate uh the
 
05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor's goal and his eloquent
 
05:17:54.628 --> 05:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
testimony uh introducing uh the bill I
 
05:17:56.470 --> 05:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
obviously eversource could not agree
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
more uh about the critical nature of
 
05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
securing uh the transmission and
 
05:18:04.590 --> 05:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
Distribution Systems that we operate uh
 
05:18:09.470 --> 05:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
it is a um uh significant issue it is is
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know the sponsor is correct to
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
point out the significant and consistent
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
threats that that infrastructure faces
 
05:18:21.110 --> 05:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
on a daily hourly minute by minute basis
 
05:18:24.910 --> 05:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
um I did want to just testify uh because
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want the committee um or or the
 
05:18:30.510 --> 05:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor quite frankly to be left with
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
the impression that there is a
 
05:18:35.868 --> 05:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
regulatory Gap uh that the utility and I
 
05:18:37.750 --> 05:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
can only speak for uh eversource
 
05:18:39.788 --> 05:18:39.798 align:start position:0%
obviously but uh that electric
 
05:18:42.190 --> 05:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
distribution and transmission uh
 
05:18:44.548 --> 05:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
utilities um there isn't adequate
 
05:18:47.708 --> 05:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
oversight or coordination with state and
 
05:18:49.830 --> 05:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
federal uh agencies and so I just
 
05:18:51.910 --> 05:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
thought it might be helpful just to take
 
05:18:54.390 --> 05:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
off a few of the agencies that have
 
05:18:57.788 --> 05:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight uh in this area and
 
05:18:59.830 --> 05:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
that we have to coordinate uh this is
 
05:19:02.788 --> 05:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
not a comprehensive list um but they do
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
include the Federal Energy Regulatory
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
Commission the cyber security or FK the
 
05:19:10.510 --> 05:19:10.520 align:start position:0%

05:19:13.030 --> 05:19:13.040 align:start position:0%

05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%

05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
ISO New England which I know this
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
committee is very well familiar with the
 
05:19:22.590 --> 05:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
National Association of regulatory
 
05:19:26.070 --> 05:19:26.080 align:start position:0%

05:19:40.350 --> 05:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
well as state and federal law
 
05:19:43.708 --> 05:19:43.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh agencies uh these are all
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
different state federal agencies that uh
 
05:19:50.350 --> 05:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
either promate rules set guidelines or
 
05:19:52.190 --> 05:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
we have to share confidential
 
05:19:54.750 --> 05:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
information with them regarding our
 
05:19:57.070 --> 05:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
cyber security or physical security
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
planning uh and that's both for the
 
05:20:02.190 --> 05:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
transmission and the distribution
 
05:20:05.788 --> 05:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh I will say um we look
 
05:20:08.910 --> 05:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
at this from a number of different uh
 
05:20:12.390 --> 05:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
perspectives not just the operational
 
05:20:16.350 --> 05:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
perspective of the security at during uh
 
05:20:18.548 --> 05:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
communic grid communication and grid
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
operations but also we look very
 
05:20:23.628 --> 05:20:23.638 align:start position:0%
carefully at our supply chains and the
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
equipment and the origin of that
 
05:20:28.590 --> 05:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
equipment uh that actually gets put into
 
05:20:31.708 --> 05:20:31.718 align:start position:0%
uh our systems um the the
 
05:20:35.230 --> 05:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
only note uh of concern I would point
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
out is just um you know just trying to
 
05:20:43.510 --> 05:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
think through the um operations of this
 
05:20:48.390 --> 05:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and um what we can
 
05:20:51.150 --> 05:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
share uh with the public and what we can
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
share with uh a legislative committee uh
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
I obviously mentioned a lot of different
 
05:21:00.150 --> 05:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
state and federal agencies uh a lot of
 
05:21:01.750 --> 05:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
that planning a lot of that work is
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
provided on a confidential basis and is
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
obviously um a matter of of state and
 
05:21:10.670 --> 05:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
federal security so uh with that I'd be
 
05:21:13.110 --> 05:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer uh whatever questions I
 
05:21:15.948 --> 05:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
can but again I I just do want to point
 
05:21:18.788 --> 05:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
out that um very much in agreement with
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
the SP sponsor's goal and intent and I
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
think he uh did a very good job
 
05:21:26.708 --> 05:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.830 --> 05:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
face Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:21:31.150 --> 05:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking me a
 
05:21:36.350 --> 05:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
question um I I agree with both parties
 
05:21:41.670 --> 05:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
um my question is you named off a lot of
 
05:21:43.390 --> 05:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
agencies just then and I'm sure that
 
05:21:46.990 --> 05:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't all of them do you believe that
 
05:21:47.000 --> 05:21:48.548 align:start position:0%
wasn't all of them do you believe that
this

05:21:48.548 --> 05:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:21:51.750 --> 05:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
legislation would be able
 
05:21:51.760 --> 05:21:53.548 align:start position:0%
legislation would be able
to

05:21:53.548 --> 05:21:53.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
determine or
 
05:21:59.070 --> 05:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
evaluate um if these agencies are
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
all accurately talking to each other for
 
05:22:04.910 --> 05:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
a common me in other words are they all
 
05:22:07.948 --> 05:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
working together for a common message so
 
05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
this that committee would be able to
 
05:22:13.230 --> 05:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
understand if anything else needs to be
 
05:22:16.670 --> 05:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
done or not or would we be mired in a
 
05:22:18.390 --> 05:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
lot of different agencies with a lot of
 
05:22:21.030 --> 05:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
different rules that may not may or may
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
not talk to each other as we've seen
 
05:22:23.868 --> 05:22:23.878 align:start position:0%
happen in the
 
05:22:26.270 --> 05:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
past I think that's an excellent
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
question um you know obviously we look
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
at it through the lens of electric uh
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the uh the legislation is
 
05:22:36.868 --> 05:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
written more broadly than that uh
 
05:22:38.868 --> 05:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
there's natural gas infrastructure
 
05:22:40.670 --> 05:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's telecommunications
 
05:22:44.110 --> 05:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um there's generation uh
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
electric generation infrastructure that
 
05:22:48.190 --> 05:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
again eversource doesn't have have a
 
05:22:51.270 --> 05:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
window into um I think it would be very
 
05:22:54.070 --> 05:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
difficult for any agency or any
 
05:22:57.390 --> 05:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
commission or committee um
 
05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to do an evaluation of each
 
05:23:03.390 --> 05:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
different state and federal agency's
 
05:23:08.190 --> 05:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
role and determine if there were gaps in
 
05:23:08.200 --> 05:23:09.150 align:start position:0%
role and determine if there were gaps in
the

05:23:09.150 --> 05:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I I think you
 
05:23:14.910 --> 05:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
would need these agencies to participate
 
05:23:18.150 --> 05:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh and I don't know what the likelihood
 
05:23:20.670 --> 05:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
of that is again we you know we would be
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
certainly uh responsive to um uh If This
 
05:23:28.510 --> 05:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
Were to pass uh but it's it's a
 
05:23:31.070 --> 05:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
significant undertaking as you might
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
imagine representative Summers has a
 
05:23:36.030 --> 05:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question going off off
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
would you would you think would you have
 
05:23:43.948 --> 05:23:43.958 align:start position:0%
to believe that the uh bill would this
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
be able to create a form of security for
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
at least Le legislators of since this is
 
05:23:52.590 --> 05:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
the science tech technology and energy
 
05:23:55.948 --> 05:23:55.958 align:start position:0%
committee to be able to grasp understand
 
05:23:58.230 --> 05:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
where our electrical grids security
 
05:24:01.708 --> 05:24:01.718 align:start position:0%
stance is where our our state's um
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
Information Technology stance security
 
05:24:05.350 --> 05:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
stance is would we be able to collect
 
05:24:06.868 --> 05:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
that do you believe this bill would
 
05:24:09.708 --> 05:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
allow us to maybe a secure in a secure
 
05:24:11.788 --> 05:24:11.798 align:start position:0%
setting be able to understand and grasp
 
05:24:15.470 --> 05:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
what the security is of our
 
05:24:15.480 --> 05:24:18.150 align:start position:0%
what the security is of our
infrastructure

05:24:18.150 --> 05:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:24:21.628 --> 05:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
um I I think this if passed this
 
05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
commission would allow an opportunity
 
05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
for members of the legislature to ask
 
05:24:31.030 --> 05:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
um different state agencies and
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
different uh private entities like
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
utilities or Telecommunications
 
05:24:40.750 --> 05:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
companies uh
 
05:24:44.868 --> 05:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
to uh provide information in a more
 
05:24:47.948 --> 05:24:47.958 align:start position:0%
General sense around planning and
 
05:24:52.510 --> 05:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
oversight um but I I think it would be I
 
05:24:54.350 --> 05:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think we could
 
05:24:58.350 --> 05:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
provide um sensitive materials on what
 
05:25:01.110 --> 05:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
the substance of those plans are in a
 
05:25:01.120 --> 05:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
the substance of those plans are in a
meaningful

05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
way representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I have similar concerns
 
05:25:12.390 --> 05:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
that have been already raised um you
 
05:25:16.990 --> 05:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
specifically said um that that you have
 
05:25:19.948 --> 05:25:19.958 align:start position:0%
confidential plans um committee meetings
 
05:25:22.350 --> 05:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
are open to the public and they're taped
 
05:25:26.030 --> 05:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
so so that would we couldn't discuss any
 
05:25:29.310 --> 05:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
confidential plans but my my question is
 
05:25:32.310 --> 05:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
does unitel have a dedicated person or
 
05:25:35.670 --> 05:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
Department uh I'm sorry eversource um
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
that sorry um that regularly meets to
 
05:25:41.948 --> 05:25:41.958 align:start position:0%
address um these issues and do all of
 
05:25:43.510 --> 05:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
the utilities to the best of your
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge have a similar Counterpoint
 
05:25:48.548 --> 05:25:48.558 align:start position:0%
person or Department yes we we uh at
 
05:25:48.558 --> 05:25:50.030 align:start position:0%
person or Department yes we we uh at
eversource

05:25:50.030 --> 05:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
eversource
 
05:25:54.070 --> 05:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
have departments plural that are
 
05:25:57.548 --> 05:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
responsible for cyber security uh
 
05:26:00.390 --> 05:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
Information Technology physical security
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
and those extend to you know the
 
05:26:05.788 --> 05:26:05.798 align:start position:0%
security of our meters uh the compliance
 
05:26:07.590 --> 05:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
of those the communications of those
 
05:26:10.910 --> 05:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
meters um uh all the way through our
 
05:26:13.470 --> 05:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
operations Department if you think you
 
05:26:14.990 --> 05:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
this committee has heard presentations
 
05:26:17.310 --> 05:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
from me and other Utilities in the past
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
about grid Automation and our SK systems
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the communications that we have um
 
05:26:26.590 --> 05:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
throughout our electric and trans
 
05:26:29.190 --> 05:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
distribution and transmission systems so
 
05:26:31.628 --> 05:26:31.638 align:start position:0%
there are multiple departments that are
 
05:26:34.310 --> 05:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
engaged in reviewing all of uh the
 
05:26:36.030 --> 05:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
security of all of those and making sure
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
that it is compliant with our cyber
 
05:26:40.590 --> 05:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
security plans as well as all the
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
various agencies that I had mentioned
 
05:26:44.788 --> 05:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
again all the way down through our
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
supply chain and where we are sourcing
 
05:26:51.070 --> 05:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
materials from so um it is an extremely
 
05:26:54.390 --> 05:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
rigorous program n not program but
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
programs uh and I feel fairly confident
 
05:26:58.670 --> 05:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
not that I can speak for any other
 
05:27:02.390 --> 05:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
utility that uh they have similar uh
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%

05:28:04.830 --> 05:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%

C Pacer um you're on thank you Mr Vice
 
05:28:22.030 --> 05:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
chair good afternoon members of the
 
05:28:24.310 --> 05:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
committee for the record representative
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
Michael Vose representing Rockingham
 
05:28:26.958 --> 05:28:28.110 align:start position:0%
Michael Vose representing Rockingham
District

05:28:28.110 --> 05:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
Five so I'm here to introduce on behalf
 
05:28:34.230 --> 05:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
of the senate senate Bill four this is
 
05:28:37.590 --> 05:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
identical to the C Pacer bill that we
 
05:28:40.390 --> 05:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
heard in this committee last Tuesday a
 
05:28:41.310 --> 05:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
week from
 
05:28:45.430 --> 05:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
today there are two changes to this bill
 
05:28:48.868 --> 05:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
compared to the one we heard last week
 
05:28:51.470 --> 05:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
and Mr key Wallace from the business
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority will refresh our
 
05:28:56.590 --> 05:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
memory as to what those two changes are
 
05:28:59.868 --> 05:28:59.878 align:start position:0%
I didn't write them down so I'm not 100%
 
05:29:03.230 --> 05:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
certain but um when we heard a
 
05:29:04.788 --> 05:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
description of what those changes would
 
05:29:07.390 --> 05:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
be last week we both we all agreed I
 
05:29:09.990 --> 05:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
think that those changes were good ones
 
05:29:13.110 --> 05:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
and made the bill even
 
05:29:17.868 --> 05:29:17.878 align:start position:0%
better so what the Senate did with this
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill is they passed it out of committee
 
05:29:21.628 --> 05:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
then they passed it through the entire
 
05:29:24.788 --> 05:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
Senate sent it over here to us and what
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
the house leadership has asked us to do
 
05:29:31.788 --> 05:29:31.798 align:start position:0%
is to pass this Senate Bill hold on to
 
05:29:34.990 --> 05:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
our house bill until this Senate Bill
 
05:29:38.150 --> 05:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
comes before the full house if it pass
 
05:29:42.868 --> 05:29:42.878 align:start position:0%
is the Full House then we can um it'll
 
05:29:45.070 --> 05:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
go to the governor's desk and we can
 
05:29:49.030 --> 05:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
dispose of the house bill as this bill
 
05:29:51.030 --> 05:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
will take its
 
05:29:54.070 --> 05:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
place so with that bill introduction I'm
 
05:29:56.670 --> 05:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
going to step aside and let Mr key
 
05:29:58.590 --> 05:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
Wallace answer any questions that you
 
05:30:00.830 --> 05:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
might have about the Bill thank you
 
05:30:02.470 --> 05:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vs there be no
 
05:30:05.628 --> 05:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
questions I'll call on Mr James key
 
05:30:05.638 --> 05:30:08.110 align:start position:0%
questions I'll call on Mr James key
Wallace

05:30:08.110 --> 05:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
Wallace
 
05:30:12.510 --> 05:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
welcome Mr James K walles thank you very
 
05:30:17.628 --> 05:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
much Mr uh Vice chair um um for the
 
05:30:19.470 --> 05:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
record James key Wallace executive
 
05:30:21.150 --> 05:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire business
 
05:30:24.150 --> 05:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority I'm a little bit more
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh stuffy in my nose than I was here
 
05:30:30.868 --> 05:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
last week I apologize um so um if I
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
sound a little stuffy that's just the
 
05:30:34.910 --> 05:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
way it is but I hope we didn't give you
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
something I don't think so I think was
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
courtesy of my uh cute and cuddly
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
5-year-old kindergarten son so um so uh
 
05:30:47.470 --> 05:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
this bill as chairman Vose correctly
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out differs in two small ways
 
05:30:53.628 --> 05:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
from the bill we heard testimony on last
 
05:30:55.628 --> 05:30:55.638 align:start position:0%
week perhaps I'd like to start just by
 
05:30:57.390 --> 05:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
identifying what those are to refresh
 
05:30:59.548 --> 05:30:59.558 align:start position:0%
the committee and then after that I'm
 
05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
happy to repeat my testimony or as the
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
committee prefers just take questions
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
that you may have had since now and then
 
05:31:11.548 --> 05:31:11.558 align:start position:0%
so so the first change from the house
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
sponsored bill is at the top of page
 
05:31:19.230 --> 05:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
five the sentence starting on line
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
one you can see here the sentence in s
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
sp4 reads enter into agreements with
 
05:31:28.990 --> 05:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
owners of eligible property in which the
 
05:31:32.910 --> 05:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
owners have consented there was an extra
 
05:31:35.390 --> 05:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
apostrophe that was confusing in the
 
05:31:39.430 --> 05:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
previous bill um sounds minor but it it
 
05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
actually confuses how many of the owners
 
05:31:45.430 --> 05:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
are needed to provide consent to
 
05:31:47.510 --> 05:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
encumber the property this says well
 
05:31:50.750 --> 05:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
they all do which makes sense so that's
 
05:31:50.760 --> 05:31:52.230 align:start position:0%
they all do which makes sense so that's
change

05:31:52.230 --> 05:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:31:55.708 --> 05:31:55.718 align:start position:0%
one change two is on the next page on
 
05:31:55.718 --> 05:31:56.750 align:start position:0%
one change two is on the next page on
page

05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:32:00.830 --> 05:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
six it's the sentences beginning at the
 
05:32:03.868 --> 05:32:03.878 align:start position:0%
very end of line 26 and finishing on
 
05:32:03.878 --> 05:32:05.150 align:start position:0%
very end of line 26 and finishing on
line

05:32:05.150 --> 05:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:32:08.470 --> 05:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
28 the existing language in the house
 
05:32:11.708 --> 05:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
bill didn't explicitly refer to the
 
05:32:13.390 --> 05:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
statute in
 
05:32:16.110 --> 05:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
91a about confidential commercial and
 
05:32:19.070 --> 05:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
financial information which existing BFA
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
loan applications are defined as so this
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the language to
 
05:32:27.470 --> 05:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
protect applicants personal financial
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
statements the business's Trade Secrets
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
their budgets all of those things that
 
05:32:35.830 --> 05:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
people don't want to just have all out
 
05:32:37.868 --> 05:32:37.878 align:start position:0%
there for anyone to see when they apply
 
05:32:41.868 --> 05:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
for a loan so that clarifies exactly
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
what that's pointing to in
 
05:32:47.830 --> 05:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
91a those are the two changes Mr
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you this is a weird
 
05:32:51.628 --> 05:32:51.638 align:start position:0%
question I know but if you look at the
 
05:32:56.110 --> 05:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
very bottom of page 6 line
 
05:33:01.070 --> 05:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
37 what is that bracket
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
semicolon there do you know what that is
 
05:33:06.990 --> 05:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
that a mistake or does that have some
 
05:33:07.000 --> 05:33:08.590 align:start position:0%
that a mistake or does that have some
meeting

05:33:08.590 --> 05:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:33:11.470 --> 05:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
it appears to me to be the first
 
05:33:13.628 --> 05:33:13.638 align:start position:0%
character of The Struck Provisions which
 
05:33:16.628 --> 05:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
continue on the next page page seven
 
05:33:19.390 --> 05:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
okay y yep okay thank you that is a
 
05:33:22.590 --> 05:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
weird yeah yeah absolutely that's called
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
a hanging something yeah okay thank you
 
05:33:29.910 --> 05:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions representative
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair um I
 
05:33:36.830 --> 05:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
took this current bill and I compared it
 
05:33:40.150 --> 05:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
Page by page with the previous one and I
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
just want to confirm that it is exactly
 
05:33:45.990 --> 05:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
the same bill save those two edits would
 
05:33:48.430 --> 05:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
you not would you agree is that a
 
05:33:50.990 --> 05:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
correct assessment yes that's my
 
05:33:53.350 --> 05:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
assessment thank
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah let me first by saying I
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't here last week I couldn't make
 
05:34:01.750 --> 05:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing so I'm a little I've been
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
trying to read this bill and make sense
 
05:34:04.750 --> 05:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
of it and as you can imagine it is
 
05:34:06.910 --> 05:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly complicated but I'm trying to
 
05:34:08.270 --> 05:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
find out
 
05:34:10.190 --> 05:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
if a couple of basic things about it is
 
05:34:13.150 --> 05:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
this then going to allow towns to
 
05:34:16.750 --> 05:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
finance uh qualified projects for
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
renewable energy whatever for private
 
05:34:22.430 --> 05:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
houses so great question representative
 
05:34:25.830 --> 05:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
so um so by way of background New
 
05:34:28.030 --> 05:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has an existing
 
05:34:32.310 --> 05:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
cace legislation in place already and I
 
05:34:34.150 --> 05:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
think work started in the legislature
 
05:34:36.310 --> 05:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
almost 15 years ago um with the first
 
05:34:38.948 --> 05:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
version of that bill no cpce loans have
 
05:34:42.310 --> 05:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
been made um so this bill is an attempt
 
05:34:46.510 --> 05:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
to remedy the deficits in the various
 
05:34:49.150 --> 05:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
statutory versions over the
 
05:34:54.030 --> 05:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
years so cace is a private loan from a
 
05:34:57.628 --> 05:34:57.638 align:start position:0%
private lender to a privately owned
 
05:35:00.868 --> 05:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
commercial property for the purposes of
 
05:35:02.590 --> 05:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
primarily energy
 
05:35:05.948 --> 05:35:05.958 align:start position:0%
improvements and what is unique about a
 
05:35:09.270 --> 05:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
cace loan is that instead of writing
 
05:35:11.030 --> 05:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
your check to your bank which they
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
probably also will have a bank um each
 
05:35:15.670 --> 05:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
month for your loan payment you pay the
 
05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
cpce loan through a special assessment
 
05:35:22.070 --> 05:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
on your Municipal tax bill it's not in
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
lie of the existing taxes that get paid
 
05:35:28.470 --> 05:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't uh jump ahead of the town's
 
05:35:31.990 --> 05:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
taxes or the bank's existing loan um
 
05:35:34.510 --> 05:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
it's just the way the billing is done
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
and that actually creates some you
 
05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
unique mechanisms for the cace lenders
 
05:35:41.948 --> 05:35:41.958 align:start position:0%
which are all private lenders including
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
Banks and other other folks where the
 
05:35:48.910 --> 05:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
loan because it's a tax assessment we we
 
05:35:51.310 --> 05:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
say it sticks with the property so if
 
05:35:53.590 --> 05:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
you owned a building and you were like I
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
want to make some energy improvements
 
05:35:57.510 --> 05:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
save some money you sell the building
 
05:36:00.030 --> 05:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
you pay off your bank but the cace loan
 
05:36:01.788 --> 05:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
is inherited by whoever buys your
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
building you know full disclosure it's
 
05:36:07.350 --> 05:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
consent like they all everyone knows um
 
05:36:09.310 --> 05:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
and and that way you can make those
 
05:36:11.470 --> 05:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
improvements without having to be like
 
05:36:12.990 --> 05:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
ah geez if I don't own this building for
 
05:36:14.670 --> 05:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
a decade I'm not going to
 
05:36:17.670 --> 05:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
see the ROI on this investment so I'm
 
05:36:20.830 --> 05:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
just not going to do it this lets the
 
05:36:23.708 --> 05:36:23.718 align:start position:0%
debt related to the energy Improvement
 
05:36:25.670 --> 05:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
just get paid over time regardless of
 
05:36:28.948 --> 05:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
whoever owns the building follow up
 
05:36:31.628 --> 05:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
follow up but there's no liability on
 
05:36:34.110 --> 05:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
the part of the municipality whatsoever
 
05:36:36.350 --> 05:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
and in fact if I read this correctly
 
05:36:38.350 --> 05:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
whatever administrative cost they have
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
from collecting this money they get to
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
charge whatever this Authority is and
 
05:36:45.590 --> 05:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
get paid their money get reimbursed yes
 
05:36:47.430 --> 05:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative both of those are correct
 
05:36:50.548 --> 05:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
no liability for the state or any town
 
05:36:52.868 --> 05:36:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh this is an opt-in program so towns
 
05:36:54.510 --> 05:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
can choose to adopt it if they want it's
 
05:36:58.750 --> 05:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
still private loans um most towns elect
 
05:37:00.830 --> 05:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
if so we looked at states that do cpce
 
05:37:02.750 --> 05:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
around the country there's about 20
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
something of
 
05:37:07.628 --> 05:37:07.638 align:start position:0%
them the town has the option to do the
 
05:37:09.670 --> 05:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
billing themselves if they want to incur
 
05:37:12.910 --> 05:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
the cost and get reimbursed or the costs
 
05:37:15.070 --> 05:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
can be done via like your your loan like
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
when you make your mortgage payment on
 
05:37:17.990 --> 05:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
your house there's an escrow line for
 
05:37:21.030 --> 05:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
your property taxes and insurance same
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
thing with cpay they you just you just
 
05:37:25.990 --> 05:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
make your payment the lender is the one
 
05:37:27.270 --> 05:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
putting all the checks in the right
 
05:37:32.470 --> 05:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:36.430 --> 05:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
me okay representative Swanson has a
 
05:37:38.788 --> 05:37:38.798 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:37:42.548 --> 05:37:42.558 align:start position:0%
you very much uh I uh attended the cpce
 
05:37:44.948 --> 05:37:44.958 align:start position:0%
discussion on the other Bill last week
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
and uh this very intriguing Financial
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
instrument just a couple of uh of
 
05:37:54.230 --> 05:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
curiosity uh related questions one is uh
 
05:37:56.990 --> 05:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I get my tax bill twice a year but if
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
I get a loan on the house I pay once a
 
05:38:02.948 --> 05:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
month so uh is it I mean are these
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
structured so that they can accept the
 
05:38:08.910 --> 05:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
payments twice a year or Sammy
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
anel so because it's a private loan from
 
05:38:15.708 --> 05:38:15.718 align:start position:0%
the cace provider really the payment
 
05:38:17.750 --> 05:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
schedule can be structured however they
 
05:38:21.670 --> 05:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the borrower want it to be um you
 
05:38:23.868 --> 05:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
know typically you see monthly because
 
05:38:26.830 --> 05:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
these are viewed really as I don't want
 
05:38:29.750 --> 05:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
to say conventional loans but mostly
 
05:38:31.590 --> 05:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
conventional loans that just happen to
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
be build through the tax system because
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the benefits the Lend enjoys from a
 
05:38:41.708 --> 05:38:41.718 align:start position:0%
security perspective so cpce borrowers
 
05:38:43.788 --> 05:38:43.798 align:start position:0%
are they're paying their loan every
 
05:38:47.468 --> 05:38:47.478 align:start position:0%
month um even if the assessment isn't
 
05:38:49.788 --> 05:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
due till every six months but usually
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
it's due every month they pay every
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
month well thank you for your answer
 
05:38:59.190 --> 05:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
followup followup uh just
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh similar to that uh what is the
 
05:39:04.788 --> 05:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
typical duration how many years are
 
05:39:07.708 --> 05:39:07.718 align:start position:0%
these loans made for that's a great
 
05:39:12.468 --> 05:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
question so cpce is designed to try and
 
05:39:15.150 --> 05:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
stretch the repayment of the financing
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
out enough that whatever Improvement
 
05:39:19.548 --> 05:39:19.558 align:start position:0%
you're doing to your property is cash
 
05:39:21.230 --> 05:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
flow positive right that's the whole
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
idea make the property more profitable
 
05:39:27.270 --> 05:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
and save energy so the length of these
 
05:39:29.670 --> 05:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
loans is defined by the the lender
 
05:39:32.628 --> 05:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
providing the loan and they
 
05:39:35.670 --> 05:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
generally make that definition based on
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
the nature of the Improvement
 
05:39:42.310 --> 05:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
so if it's a easy really high Roi
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
project you might see a shorter loan
 
05:39:46.590 --> 05:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
because the savings are great and you
 
05:39:48.468 --> 05:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
know you can have a fiveyear loan for
 
05:39:51.070 --> 05:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
example some loans are 20-year loans
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
right some are even longer um so it
 
05:39:56.910 --> 05:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
really just matches whatever the
 
05:39:58.548 --> 05:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
Improvement is thank you for your answer
 
05:40:00.190 --> 05:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:40:03.310 --> 05:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
Chair by chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:40:04.910 --> 05:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
05:40:07.310 --> 05:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
question and uh if I was going to
 
05:40:09.310 --> 05:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
explain this back to my town I need to
 
05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
ask this question for one U at least
 
05:40:15.990 --> 05:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
from my point of view many uh property
 
05:40:19.270 --> 05:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
taxes are combined with your mortgage
 
05:40:22.390 --> 05:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
payments through your mortgage e so you
 
05:40:26.310 --> 05:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
know they uh they the person holding
 
05:40:29.708 --> 05:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
your mortgage pays monthly into the
 
05:40:33.670 --> 05:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
taxes and the mortgages as well or puts
 
05:40:36.708 --> 05:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
it into a scroll how how is that handled
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
if the the lender wants to be paid
 
05:40:42.430 --> 05:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
monthly does the mortgage Holder have to
 
05:40:45.270 --> 05:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
make those individual payments to the
 
05:40:45.280 --> 05:40:46.708 align:start position:0%
make those individual payments to the
cace

05:40:46.708 --> 05:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
cace
 
05:40:49.230 --> 05:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
lender thank you representative uh
 
05:40:51.310 --> 05:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
typically that's the way it's done um
 
05:40:53.390 --> 05:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's designed to try and be as kind of
 
05:40:56.670 --> 05:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
easy on people as possible um so the
 
05:40:58.990 --> 05:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
money has to get to the cpce lender
 
05:41:00.788 --> 05:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
right not the town because it's not the
 
05:41:02.750 --> 05:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
town who's owed the money it's the the
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
person providing the loan um some cpce
 
05:41:08.150 --> 05:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
lenders just say you can write me a
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
check you know most folks say do it
 
05:41:13.230 --> 05:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
exactly as you described pay your
 
05:41:17.070 --> 05:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
mortgage your escrow amount is this and
 
05:41:19.230 --> 05:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
then that amount gets divied out to the
 
05:41:22.190 --> 05:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
cpce lender to your Municipal tax
 
05:41:24.628 --> 05:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
obligations your insurance company all
 
05:41:24.638 --> 05:41:28.910 align:start position:0%
obligations your insurance company all
that

05:41:28.910 --> 05:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:31.390 --> 05:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
stuff uh representative Harrington has
 
05:41:31.400 --> 05:41:32.510 align:start position:0%
stuff uh representative Harrington has
another

05:41:32.510 --> 05:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:41:35.310 --> 05:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'm looking at this uh I
 
05:41:37.628 --> 05:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
guess it's kind of two-part so I'll ask
 
05:41:40.350 --> 05:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
both of them uh the authority that this
 
05:41:42.390 --> 05:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
creates has that already been created
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
you said there was no loans but and it
 
05:41:47.350 --> 05:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be anticipated expenses for the
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
administration of the program should be
 
05:41:50.230 --> 05:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
borne by the owners of eligible
 
05:41:52.910 --> 05:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
properties participating so whatever
 
05:41:54.788 --> 05:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
cost are associated with this Authority
 
05:41:57.670 --> 05:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
are going to be included in part of the
 
05:42:00.670 --> 05:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
loan repayments is that correct uh yes
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
representative so the authority is
 
05:42:05.150 --> 05:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
referencing us at the business Finance
 
05:42:07.830 --> 05:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
Authority and the statute requires that
 
05:42:10.750 --> 05:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
the users of the program The Borrowers
 
05:42:12.868 --> 05:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
and the lenders pay for the cost of
 
05:42:15.708 --> 05:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
administering the program okay followup
 
05:42:19.070 --> 05:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
follow up well you can go out and get a
 
05:42:21.310 --> 05:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
loan for something if it's a worthwhile
 
05:42:23.230 --> 05:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
project you want to put solar panels on
 
05:42:26.548 --> 05:42:26.558 align:start position:0%
your house uh if you what is the perp
 
05:42:28.430 --> 05:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
why do we need this extra Authority that
 
05:42:30.590 --> 05:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
obviously brings in more bureaucracy
 
05:42:32.468 --> 05:42:32.478 align:start position:0%
more cost administrative all sorts of
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
administrative costs why why do we have
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
to do this for alone we don't we don't
 
05:42:40.590 --> 05:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
don't say oh you can go get a loan to
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
get a higher mileage car so you can pay
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
for it through your uh property taxes or
 
05:42:48.150 --> 05:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
your or your tax assessment on your car
 
05:42:49.868 --> 05:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
I just don't understand why do we need
 
05:42:51.670 --> 05:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
this what is it what's what's the
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
benefit yeah that's a great a great
 
05:42:57.150 --> 05:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
question so uh two parts to that so
 
05:43:00.430 --> 05:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
there's no new Authority being creative
 
05:43:03.030 --> 05:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
like the BF the BFA already exists we
 
05:43:05.310 --> 05:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
would run this program with no
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses or any EXP
 
05:43:09.070 --> 05:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
expenses out of pocket expenses we would
 
05:43:11.390 --> 05:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
have get passed on to the the users of
 
05:43:13.110 --> 05:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
the program that's the BFA is a
 
05:43:16.350 --> 05:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
self-funded entity that doesn't use any
 
05:43:17.310 --> 05:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
uh State
 
05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
funds um so but you're right so like
 
05:43:22.590 --> 05:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
what's the point of cace can't you just
 
05:43:24.788 --> 05:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
get a loan you know when you when you
 
05:43:27.948 --> 05:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
need it um as it turns out the answer is
 
05:43:32.590 --> 05:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
only sometimes um a lot of energy
 
05:43:37.390 --> 05:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
improvements don't really add physical
 
05:43:40.270 --> 05:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
kind of value that you can liquidate
 
05:43:41.948 --> 05:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
right like you know Banks want hard
 
05:43:44.310 --> 05:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
collateral to say if I lend you this
 
05:43:45.868 --> 05:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
money it doesn't work out I'm going to
 
05:43:49.150 --> 05:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
sell this asset and get paid back you
 
05:43:50.670 --> 05:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
can't really do that when you're adding
 
05:43:53.948 --> 05:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
insulation in the walls or you know more
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
efficient Windows because you really
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
can't separate the improvements to the
 
05:44:01.868 --> 05:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
building from the the building and so
 
05:44:03.708 --> 05:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
banks are constrained and what they can
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
do they might say well this makes sense
 
05:44:08.670 --> 05:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
from a cash flow perspective but it
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense from a collateral
 
05:44:13.230 --> 05:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
perspective so I can't make the
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
loan cace
 
05:44:18.390 --> 05:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
lenders address that problem by using
 
05:44:22.948 --> 05:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
this tax repayment mechanism because the
 
05:44:25.230 --> 05:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
existence of this assessment the special
 
05:44:27.548 --> 05:44:27.558 align:start position:0%
tax assessment means as long as
 
05:44:29.628 --> 05:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
someone's in the building could be the
 
05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
next owner or the owner after that those
 
05:44:36.548 --> 05:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
that person will pick up and make the
 
05:44:39.910 --> 05:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
monthly cace loans so they know they'll
 
05:44:43.230 --> 05:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
get paid eventually um so it's just a
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
way to secure their cash
 
05:44:47.510 --> 05:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
flow lending separate from the
 
05:44:49.628 --> 05:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
collateral it's a niche product I mean
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
in my personal opinion like this isn't
 
05:44:53.350 --> 05:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know you're not going to see
 
05:44:55.948 --> 05:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
thousands of these this is something
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:04.830 --> 05:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
time uh representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:45:08.788 --> 05:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:45:09.948 --> 05:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
you you were just talking about
 
05:45:11.390 --> 05:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
different kinds of loans and everything
 
05:45:14.590 --> 05:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
does does the cpce loan um have a set
 
05:45:16.910 --> 05:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
interest rate or is there a cap on on
 
05:45:18.390 --> 05:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
the interest or anything like that is
 
05:45:20.788 --> 05:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
there an advantage to this loan over
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
other loans other than it goes on the
 
05:45:25.030 --> 05:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
taxes thank you representative um
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're private loans so the rates are
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
set by the private Market um mean there
 
05:45:33.390 --> 05:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
are definite advantages to the borrower
 
05:45:37.110 --> 05:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
for using a cpce program um you know one
 
05:45:39.190 --> 05:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
of it one of which is you can get
 
05:45:40.670 --> 05:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
something financed that's going to make
 
05:45:40.680 --> 05:45:41.390 align:start position:0%
something financed that's going to make
your

05:45:41.390 --> 05:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:45:44.670 --> 05:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
building more stable and profitable in a
 
05:45:47.788 --> 05:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
way that you can't do sometimes from a
 
05:45:50.670 --> 05:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
conventional debt um so there's
 
05:45:54.590 --> 05:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
definitely a borrower benefit um a lot
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
of times those energy improvements are
 
05:46:00.788 --> 05:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
are made with owner equity which means
 
05:46:02.750 --> 05:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
if you talk to the developers you know
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
who really first raised this issue um
 
05:46:07.628 --> 05:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
here in the state
 
05:46:09.510 --> 05:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
that means that Equity is not available
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
to do the next say housing project or
 
05:46:13.430 --> 05:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
commercial Redevelopment because it's
 
05:46:17.628 --> 05:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
all kind of absorbed into one project um
 
05:46:21.468 --> 05:46:21.478 align:start position:0%
so those are the those are the big ones
 
05:46:24.910 --> 05:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
followup followup um and is this
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
anything that can be claimed on taxes or
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:33.230 --> 05:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
all as a deduction is that sorry is that
 
05:46:35.070 --> 05:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
the question representative cor yeah
 
05:46:38.788 --> 05:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
yeah um I would that is a great question
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
I am not a tax attorney I would imagine
 
05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
it is because cpce loans have principal
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
and interest like any other loan and
 
05:46:50.788 --> 05:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
interest is generally deductible but
 
05:46:53.030 --> 05:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that's I don't know that's a
 
05:46:57.788 --> 05:46:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:00.830 --> 05:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
assume okay seeing no more questions
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
oops one more question representative
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
Harrington okay so this is all put out
 
05:47:08.670 --> 05:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
there for Mak loans easier to get
 
05:47:10.788 --> 05:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
obviously sometimes in loans there's a
 
05:47:13.230 --> 05:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
default so the person owning the
 
05:47:14.948 --> 05:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
property I don't know they die they move
 
05:47:17.350 --> 05:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
away whatever they they lose their job
 
05:47:19.590 --> 05:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
they stop making any payments the house
 
05:47:21.990 --> 05:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
is up for sale it's not moving very good
 
05:47:24.510 --> 05:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
at all who eats the
 
05:47:26.990 --> 05:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
cost um in that case it would be the
 
05:47:29.110 --> 05:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
lender because they've lent the money
 
05:47:32.110 --> 05:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
and they're at risk um I I would point
 
05:47:34.230 --> 05:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
out though representative that this is
 
05:47:36.150 --> 05:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
not eligible for single family homes
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is for commercial properties only I
 
05:47:41.548 --> 05:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
but your question still stands if
 
05:47:43.948 --> 05:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
somebody fails and they can't repay
 
05:47:47.150 --> 05:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
their loans the lenders who lent them

05:47:51.430 --> 05:47:51.440 align:start position:0%

05:56:43.310 --> 05:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:56:46.910 --> 05:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
166 representative Harrington is
 
05:56:48.910 --> 05:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
recognized well I think in the testimony
 
05:56:50.590 --> 05:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
we heard on this it's clear that this is
 
05:56:53.310 --> 05:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
already going on that all the providers
 
05:56:54.990 --> 05:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
are making their best effort right now
 
05:56:56.548 --> 05:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
they're already moving from copper to
 
05:56:58.708 --> 05:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
fiber and we really don't need a
 
05:57:00.868 --> 05:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
committee to to look at what's already
 
05:57:02.990 --> 05:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
occurring uh there's also some technical
 
05:57:04.510 --> 05:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
mistakes in the bill where it talks
 
05:57:07.230 --> 05:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
about bringing the Public Utilities
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
Commission in which has no jurisdiction
 
05:57:12.350 --> 05:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
over internet and then also Union
 
05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives which I have no idea why
 
05:57:15.468 --> 05:57:15.478 align:start position:0%
they would be want to be brought in as
 
05:57:17.430 --> 05:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
well but I I just think this bill is
 
05:57:19.548 --> 05:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
totally unnecessary because the problem
 
05:57:22.430 --> 05:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist it's taking care of
 
05:57:26.350 --> 05:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
itself additional comment discussion on
 
05:57:26.360 --> 05:57:29.468 align:start position:0%
itself additional comment discussion on
this

05:57:29.468 --> 05:57:29.478 align:start position:0%

any further discussion
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
needed seeing none I'd ask the clerk to
 
05:57:44.670 --> 05:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
call the role on the question of itl on
 
05:57:48.030 --> 05:57:48.040 align:start position:0%

05:59:37.750 --> 05:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
recognize Rec uh Vice chair Thomas
 
05:59:41.948 --> 05:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh basically uh we
 
05:59:44.350 --> 05:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that the Pu holds many
 
05:59:46.948 --> 05:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
hearings without commissions and that
 
05:59:49.510 --> 05:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
current Commissioners oppose this change
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
and it really attempts to fix a problem
 
05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
that really doesn't exist so it's not
 
05:59:56.310 --> 05:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
needed and for that reason we should itl
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
it further discussion representative
 
06:00:02.990 --> 06:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
mgee thank you Mr chairman um I think
 
06:00:05.150 --> 06:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
the exception that we have I brought you
 
06:00:07.150 --> 06:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment that representative Corman
 
06:00:09.868 --> 06:00:09.878 align:start position:0%
had sent through uh you know digitally
 
06:00:11.910 --> 06:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
over here to have printed and we brought
 
06:00:14.350 --> 06:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
it to you for consideration because I
 
06:00:16.190 --> 06:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
think the only thing he was trying to
 
06:00:18.990 --> 06:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
clarify in statute is that a majority
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
means at least two Commissioners and the
 
06:00:24.468 --> 06:00:24.478 align:start position:0%
point was that uh commission decisions
 
06:00:26.190 --> 06:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
should be made by more than one
 
06:00:29.548 --> 06:00:29.558 align:start position:0%
individual and so I think that was the
 
06:00:33.030 --> 06:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
point of the bill and the amendment
 
06:00:37.310 --> 06:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
which is uh 2025 2
 
06:00:41.350 --> 06:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
49h um I handed to you for consideration
 
06:00:43.270 --> 06:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
anyway for this bill because I think it
 
06:00:45.830 --> 06:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies a point that we had been stuck
 
06:00:48.868 --> 06:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
on when we were in the
 
06:00:52.110 --> 06:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for that um
 
06:00:54.830 --> 06:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
explanation so during testimony on that
 
06:00:54.840 --> 06:00:58.070 align:start position:0%
explanation so during testimony on that
bill

06:00:58.070 --> 06:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:02.150 --> 06:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
nobody except the bill sponsor and
 
06:01:06.788 --> 06:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
the um consumer Advocate asked for these
 
06:01:09.110 --> 06:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
changes the utilities didn't ask for
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
these changes U no state agency asked
 
06:01:13.468 --> 06:01:13.478 align:start position:0%
for these
 
06:01:16.910 --> 06:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
changes and the Commissioners themselves
 
06:01:19.548 --> 06:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
and members of their staff indicated
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
that these changes were not necessary so
 
06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
given that it doesn't seem to me that
 
06:01:27.948 --> 06:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
anybody wants these changes except
 
06:01:30.030 --> 06:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
possibly the consumer Advocate and the
 
06:01:34.030 --> 06:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor so I think uh this bill
 
06:01:36.350 --> 06:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
really doesn't have that much support
 
06:01:38.750 --> 06:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I think uh the bill is
 
06:01:43.350 --> 06:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because if you read what it
 
06:01:45.708 --> 06:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
says what it says now before the changes
 
06:01:47.230 --> 06:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
it says the majority of the commission
 
06:01:49.708 --> 06:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
shall constitute a quorum well majority
 
06:01:52.110 --> 06:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
of three is is it two I mean we don't
 
06:01:54.910 --> 06:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
need to Define that as 2/3 a quorum to
 
06:01:57.350 --> 06:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
issue orders in any hearing may be held
 
06:01:59.390 --> 06:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
or conducted by two Commissioners or by
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
a single commissioner what this means is
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
that you can have a hearing by with with
 
06:02:05.990 --> 06:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
either three two or one commissioners
 
06:02:07.868 --> 06:02:07.878 align:start position:0%
does not mean you can issue orders the
 
06:02:10.430 --> 06:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
orders must require a quorum and many
 
06:02:12.468 --> 06:02:12.478 align:start position:0%
times the commission is very busy
 
06:02:13.910 --> 06:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
someone could be on vacation someone
 
06:02:15.910 --> 06:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
could be out sick and it's very
 
06:02:17.868 --> 06:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
difficult to schedule hearings so you
 
06:02:19.548 --> 06:02:19.558 align:start position:0%
can have a single commissioner there but
 
06:02:21.868 --> 06:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
be advised every word during that
 
06:02:24.270 --> 06:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
hearing is transcribed think of uh an
 
06:02:26.270 --> 06:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
old Perry Mason show for those who old
 
06:02:28.270 --> 06:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
enough the guy sits there like this and
 
06:02:30.030 --> 06:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
he does his little thing on the box and
 
06:02:31.990 --> 06:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
records every word that's uh done and
 
06:02:34.628 --> 06:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
it's written out and the other train uh
 
06:02:35.910 --> 06:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who might not be there
 
06:02:37.990 --> 06:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
there have access to that transcription
 
06:02:40.350 --> 06:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
so they hear everything that was said at
 
06:02:43.110 --> 06:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
the hearing and to limit it to two
 
06:02:44.830 --> 06:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to even constitute a
 
06:02:48.948 --> 06:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
hearing would bog down the Pu
 
06:02:51.590 --> 06:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
drastically additional discussion Mr
 
06:02:53.788 --> 06:02:53.798 align:start position:0%
chair representative McGee yeah I I
 
06:02:55.590 --> 06:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't think it says to constitute a
 
06:02:57.990 --> 06:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
hearing it says to constitute a quorum
 
06:02:59.310 --> 06:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
right that's what we're doing is just
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
defining that a
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
quorum means majority and a majority of
 
06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners is two so it's just
 
06:03:06.080 --> 06:03:07.948 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners is two so it's just
defining

06:03:07.948 --> 06:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
defining
 
06:03:14.590 --> 06:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:17.788 --> 06:03:17.798 align:start position:0%
says further discussion just I wanted to
 
06:03:21.390 --> 06:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
respond representative Harrington well
 
06:03:22.990 --> 06:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specifically but what it
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
removes is it as the law states now
 
06:03:27.230 --> 06:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
majority of the commission shall
 
06:03:29.590 --> 06:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
constitute a quum to issue orders and
 
06:03:31.430 --> 06:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
any hearing may be held or conducted by
 
06:03:33.070 --> 06:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners or by a single
 
06:03:34.868 --> 06:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner now the new version would
 
06:03:36.788 --> 06:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
say majority of shall constitute a
 
06:03:38.750 --> 06:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
quorum and in this chapter majority
 
06:03:41.310 --> 06:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
means 2/3 of the
 
06:03:44.670 --> 06:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
commission so it's it's no we didn't
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment we didn't look at
 
06:03:47.788 --> 06:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment but as proposed it it
 
06:03:51.110 --> 06:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
takes out conducting a hearing by a two
 
06:03:53.070 --> 06:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
or one or single commissioner which
 
06:03:54.270 --> 06:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
would imply to me that it's saying you
 
06:03:55.990 --> 06:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
can no longer do that because otherwise
 
06:03:58.548 --> 06:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
why take it out so yeah but this we
 
06:04:00.628 --> 06:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything with this so but
 
06:04:02.830 --> 06:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to kill it before you even
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
 
06:04:05.280 --> 06:04:06.468 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
PL

06:04:06.468 --> 06:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
PL
 
06:04:09.390 --> 06:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair this is to repres
 
06:04:11.830 --> 06:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington had mentioned
 
06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
I believe in testimony or back and forth
 
06:04:18.390 --> 06:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
that others like lawyers also hold
 
06:04:22.750 --> 06:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
hearings and just this bill limit limits
 
06:04:24.990 --> 06:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
it to Commissioners only that would
 
06:04:27.830 --> 06:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
probably tie up hearings if he would
 
06:04:29.708 --> 06:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
like to elaborate on that
 
06:04:33.070 --> 06:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
part hearing examiners conduct a lot of
 
06:04:34.948 --> 06:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
hearings within the Public Utilities
 
06:04:36.510 --> 06:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
Commission that don't involve
 
06:04:38.390 --> 06:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners at all you're
 
06:04:40.350 --> 06:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
correct further discussion
 
06:04:42.868 --> 06:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah thank you Mr
 
06:04:46.990 --> 06:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
chair um I would just like to uh suggest
 
06:04:50.548 --> 06:04:50.558 align:start position:0%
Which Way um I don't know probably this
 
06:04:54.070 --> 06:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
way but thank you um i' just like to
 
06:04:56.548 --> 06:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
suggest that we
 
06:04:56.558 --> 06:04:58.310 align:start position:0%
suggest that we
maybe

06:04:58.310 --> 06:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
06:05:02.230 --> 06:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh vote the itl down so we can hear the
 
06:05:04.510 --> 06:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
amendment which is designed to address
 
06:05:06.310 --> 06:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
06:05:08.468 --> 06:05:08.478 align:start position:0%
I think that we're you know we we
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the amendment but the
 
06:05:11.430 --> 06:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
amendment was really an attempt to save
 
06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
the bill so that it actually did what
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
they were looking to
 
06:05:20.670 --> 06:05:20.680 align:start position:0%

06:10:21.190 --> 06:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
06:10:24.190 --> 06:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
yes I should moved and seconded that we
 
06:10:26.590 --> 06:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
adopt the amendment
 
06:10:30.150 --> 06:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
0215 H so let me explain what this
 
06:10:33.350 --> 06:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
amendment does this amendment modifies
 
06:10:36.510 --> 06:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
the language in the original bill in the
 
06:10:40.830 --> 06:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
following ways on line six it adds the
 
06:10:44.430 --> 06:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
word diverse to the sentence that talks
 
06:10:47.468 --> 06:10:47.478 align:start position:0%
about affordable reliable and secure
 
06:10:50.190 --> 06:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
energy resources so that it now reads
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
affordable reliable diverse and secure
 
06:10:52.558 --> 06:10:54.270 align:start position:0%
affordable reliable diverse and secure
energy

06:10:54.270 --> 06:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:10:58.830 --> 06:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
resources on line nine it adds the word
 
06:11:01.670 --> 06:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
fostering after the word chapter so that
 
06:11:04.468 --> 06:11:04.478 align:start position:0%
the sentence reads the purpose of this
 
06:11:08.990 --> 06:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
chapter fostering a range of technology
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
types on line 10 it adds the following
 
06:11:18.270 --> 06:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:22.510 --> 06:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
Choice the next change is on line 14
 
06:11:25.350 --> 06:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
after the word resources it adds the
 
06:11:31.590 --> 06:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:36.670 --> 06:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
F which is the states RPS
 
06:11:38.310 --> 06:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
on line
 
06:11:40.430 --> 06:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
15 after the
 
06:11:44.190 --> 06:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
word well it changes the U that sentence
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
to read New Hampshire shall allow Market
 
06:11:48.590 --> 06:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
forces and and the new text is
 
06:11:48.600 --> 06:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
forces and and the new text is
market-based

06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
market-based
 
06:11:52.350 --> 06:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to drive prudent use of
 
06:11:52.360 --> 06:11:54.788 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to drive prudent use of
energy

06:11:54.788 --> 06:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
resources the next change is on line 20
 
06:11:59.670 --> 06:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
after the word
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
principles the phrase focusing on Market
 
06:12:07.070 --> 06:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
transformation is added to the sentence
 
06:12:08.468 --> 06:12:08.478 align:start position:0%
and on line
 
06:12:11.948 --> 06:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
21 the end of the sentence is has a new
 
06:12:15.590 --> 06:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
phrase and consistent with RSA
 
06:12:19.510 --> 06:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
374f which is the
 
06:12:19.520 --> 06:12:21.110 align:start position:0%
374f which is the
uh

06:12:21.110 --> 06:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:23.830 --> 06:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
restructuring statute for the the
 
06:12:26.750 --> 06:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
electricity market and then the final
 
06:12:29.750 --> 06:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
change starts on line 23 and ends on
 
06:12:33.468 --> 06:12:33.478 align:start position:0%
line 24 it adds the phrase public health
 
06:12:38.510 --> 06:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
and safety to the U sentence that is
 
06:12:41.390 --> 06:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
essentially paragraph five so those are
 
06:12:45.030 --> 06:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
the changes that this amendment adds to
 
06:12:49.708 --> 06:12:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:52.788 --> 06:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
changes significantly enhance the
 
06:12:55.830 --> 06:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
language of the statute or of the
 
06:12:58.788 --> 06:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
legislation make it clearer and more
 
06:13:02.990 --> 06:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
understandable and precise with regard
 
06:13:07.390 --> 06:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
to um what New Hampshire energy policy
 
06:13:10.910 --> 06:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
should contain by the way this amendment
 
06:13:12.670 --> 06:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
complet completely
 
06:13:16.230 --> 06:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
replaces uh section one of the
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
bill so that is the explanation of the
 
06:13:25.270 --> 06:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:28.390 --> 06:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
amendment representative McGee thank you
 
06:13:31.350 --> 06:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I very much appreciate your
 
06:13:33.788 --> 06:13:33.798 align:start position:0%
attempts at um modifying language here
 
06:13:37.708 --> 06:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
based on the input um in the hearing I
 
06:13:41.670 --> 06:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
think while diverse is um it's it's nice
 
06:13:44.190 --> 06:13:44.200 align:start position:0%
that that's added on line six the I
 
06:13:47.150 --> 06:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
think the fuel diversity um efforts made
 
06:13:48.070 --> 06:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
by the
 
06:13:48.080 --> 06:13:49.670 align:start position:0%
by the
state

06:13:49.670 --> 06:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:13:54.468 --> 06:13:54.478 align:start position:0%
um were more inclusive of energy types
 
06:13:57.548 --> 06:13:57.558 align:start position:0%
that are not necessarily only reliable
 
06:14:00.788 --> 06:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
on demand and firm resources there's no
 
06:14:02.830 --> 06:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
inclusion here of renewable energy
 
06:14:05.948 --> 06:14:05.958 align:start position:0%
sources which are you know intermittent
 
06:14:09.030 --> 06:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
but are still adding uh lowering our
 
06:14:11.548 --> 06:14:11.558 align:start position:0%
demand so they still have a value and
 
06:14:14.468 --> 06:14:14.478 align:start position:0%
they're no longer listed here as part of
 
06:14:16.548 --> 06:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
what is intended to be a broad statement
 
06:14:18.788 --> 06:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire energy policy so it's
 
06:14:21.708 --> 06:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
quite a departure and the other issue
 
06:14:23.910 --> 06:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
that I have although I think the other
 
06:14:27.070 --> 06:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
word smithing has been you know helpful
 
06:14:30.750 --> 06:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and responsive as well it does
 
06:14:36.190 --> 06:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
right over um 378 37
 
06:14:38.270 --> 06:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
as a definition of energy policy that I
 
06:14:41.070 --> 06:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
still believe is is
 
06:14:44.270 --> 06:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh well it's more historically accurate
 
06:14:46.350 --> 06:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
to how the state was pursuing its energy
 
06:14:48.910 --> 06:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
policy and it's more uh inclusive of
 
06:14:51.310 --> 06:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
these ideas that you've got words in
 
06:14:53.708 --> 06:14:53.718 align:start position:0%
here to allude to um in terms of the way
 
06:14:56.628 --> 06:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
it's presented uh for public
 
06:14:58.990 --> 06:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
edification to to state what the state
 
06:15:01.468 --> 06:15:01.478 align:start position:0%
is actually doing and pursuing this I
 
06:15:03.670 --> 06:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
think narrows it quite a bit and I think
 
06:15:05.670 --> 06:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
that may be the intention
 
06:15:08.948 --> 06:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh to narrow what the state's policy is
 
06:15:12.430 --> 06:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
and its Pursuits are but um fuel
 
06:15:14.750 --> 06:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
diversity is really the opposite of that
 
06:15:16.510 --> 06:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
right fuel diversity means that we're
 
06:15:19.628 --> 06:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
not narrowcasting for particular winners
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
and losers but that we're allowing fuel
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
diversity as a way to hedge against cost
 
06:15:28.670 --> 06:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
spikes and that's I think we share that
 
06:15:30.270 --> 06:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
goal we're trying to make sure that
 
06:15:33.230 --> 06:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
people are not
 
06:15:36.750 --> 06:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
um subject to price spikes because of
 
06:15:38.708 --> 06:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
the all all the eggs in one basket
 
06:15:40.990 --> 06:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
scenario that we've been banding about
 
06:15:44.070 --> 06:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
recently so I will not be voting for
 
06:15:46.030 --> 06:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
this in its current Incarnation because
 
06:15:50.350 --> 06:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
I I prefer 378 37 and we've had many
 
06:15:52.230 --> 06:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
conversations about that section so I'm
 
06:15:54.190 --> 06:15:54.200 align:start position:0%
still in the camp that wants to preserve
 
06:15:55.590 --> 06:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
that definition of the New Hampshire
 
06:16:00.708 --> 06:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:03.030 --> 06:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
06:16:05.468 --> 06:16:05.478 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman
 
06:16:11.230 --> 06:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
um uh like representative mige I truly
 
06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh sincerely do appreciate your efforts
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
your willingness to amend and to offer
 
06:16:20.990 --> 06:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
um this this amendment in place of your
 
06:16:24.510 --> 06:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
original bill I think that the changes
 
06:16:26.830 --> 06:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
you've outlined are definite
 
06:16:29.190 --> 06:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
improvements however
 
06:16:33.628 --> 06:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
I uh still will oppose the bill uh for
 
06:16:35.948 --> 06:16:35.958 align:start position:0%
two major reasons
 
06:16:41.788 --> 06:16:41.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:41.798 --> 06:16:46.708 align:start position:0%
 
just

06:16:46.708 --> 06:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:50.990 --> 06:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
um not it doesn't belong in New
 
06:16:55.190 --> 06:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's uh energy policy to to claim
 
06:16:58.110 --> 06:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
a goal of ensuring the state's energy
 
06:17:01.310 --> 06:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
Independence because New Hampshire is
 
06:17:01.320 --> 06:17:02.350 align:start position:0%
Independence because New Hampshire is
the

06:17:02.350 --> 06:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:17:06.150 --> 06:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
farthest from an potential presently or
 
06:17:08.430 --> 06:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
potentially energy independent state
 
06:17:12.310 --> 06:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
that you could have I mean we have no
 
06:17:15.468 --> 06:17:15.478 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels within our borders and yet
 
06:17:18.548 --> 06:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
we currently and for a very long time
 
06:17:22.510 --> 06:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
will uh be substantially reliant on
 
06:17:24.788 --> 06:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
imported fossil
 
06:17:28.548 --> 06:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
fuels um and everybody you know accepts
 
06:17:28.558 --> 06:17:30.430 align:start position:0%
fuels um and everybody you know accepts
that

06:17:30.430 --> 06:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:17:35.670 --> 06:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
um so we we yeah so enough said on that
 
06:17:38.868 --> 06:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh but it leads to my second point which
 
06:17:41.910 --> 06:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
while you did add the the term diverse
 
06:17:44.350 --> 06:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
in in the you know line
 
06:17:44.360 --> 06:17:47.230 align:start position:0%
in in the you know line
six

06:17:47.230 --> 06:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
six
 
06:17:50.430 --> 06:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
um the other terms you know reliable and
 
06:17:54.110 --> 06:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
secure uh discount the value they make
 
06:17:57.708 --> 06:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
no acknowledgment of the value of
 
06:18:00.350 --> 06:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
intermittent resources which you know as
 
06:18:01.708 --> 06:18:01.718 align:start position:0%
we've seen from the information
 
06:18:04.830 --> 06:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
presented to us by the iso New England
 
06:18:08.670 --> 06:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
the utilities um intermittent resources
 
06:18:11.548 --> 06:18:11.558 align:start position:0%
provide substantial value yes they're
 
06:18:14.948 --> 06:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
intermittent but when they are available
 
06:18:18.230 --> 06:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
and contributing energy to the grid they
 
06:18:21.990 --> 06:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
enable us to avoid
 
06:18:25.590 --> 06:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
using uh the the fossil resources we
 
06:18:27.310 --> 06:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
must import and so they allow those
 
06:18:29.750 --> 06:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
resources to be preserved for another
 
06:18:33.548 --> 06:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
time at another day and so I I just
 
06:18:35.350 --> 06:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
06:18:38.990 --> 06:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
incomplete to discount them completely
 
06:18:40.548 --> 06:18:40.558 align:start position:0%
to leave them out so I feel like the
 
06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
current energy policy is is a good one
 
06:18:46.868 --> 06:18:46.878 align:start position:0%
and that that's my that's my take on it
 
06:18:49.788 --> 06:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
06:18:49.798 --> 06:18:51.230 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion

representative
 
06:18:55.830 --> 06:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
Barne thank you chairman um so reading
 
06:18:59.628 --> 06:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
the existing policy the the part that
 
06:19:02.270 --> 06:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
I've heard so far uh others talking
 
06:19:05.070 --> 06:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
about is the section of uhow lowest
 
06:19:07.230 --> 06:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost while providing for the
 
06:19:10.750 --> 06:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
reliability and diversity of energy
 
06:19:13.830 --> 06:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
sources I'm I'm having difficulty
 
06:19:16.070 --> 06:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
reading all of the things that have been
 
06:19:19.910 --> 06:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned just from that uh part of the
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
sentence whereas in the in the new
 
06:19:26.030 --> 06:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
updated version um I mean it's it's
 
06:19:27.708 --> 06:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
talking about diversity and it and it
 
06:19:29.230 --> 06:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
spells out a more
 
06:19:32.230 --> 06:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
prescriptive uh policy for for the same
 
06:19:34.030 --> 06:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
thing so I guess I'm not really seeing
 
06:19:37.190 --> 06:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
where the old policy was more inclusive
 
06:19:40.868 --> 06:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:43.788 --> 06:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
different further discussion
 
06:19:43.798 --> 06:19:45.990 align:start position:0%
different further discussion
representative

06:19:45.990 --> 06:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:19:49.110 --> 06:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair I I think
 
06:19:50.948 --> 06:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of improvements in
 
06:19:54.788 --> 06:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
this amendment and uh I'm wondering if
 
06:19:57.310 --> 06:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if it's within the scope
 
06:19:59.468 --> 06:19:59.478 align:start position:0%
I have less experience here but if we
 
06:20:02.750 --> 06:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
had uh in line nine including but not
 
06:20:05.430 --> 06:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
limited to On Demand
 
06:20:08.350 --> 06:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
and Fir resources if we just inserted a
 
06:20:12.190 --> 06:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
clause but not limited to would that be
 
06:20:13.948 --> 06:20:13.958 align:start position:0%
more acceptable
 
06:20:20.270 --> 06:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:23.990 --> 06:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:25.788 --> 06:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
discussion all right seeing none I'm
 
06:20:27.350 --> 06:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
going to ask the clerk to call the role
 
06:20:29.270 --> 06:20:29.280 align:start position:0%

504 recognized representative not I
 
06:22:11.708 --> 06:22:11.718 align:start position:0%
second the motion moved and seconded
 
06:22:13.468 --> 06:22:13.478 align:start position:0%
that we adopt the motion of ought to
 
06:22:18.110 --> 06:22:18.120 align:start position:0%

15h any discussion representative
 
06:22:30.070 --> 06:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
bney pretty much what I said uh while we
 
06:22:31.708 --> 06:22:31.718 align:start position:0%
talked about the amendment that the the
 
06:22:35.030 --> 06:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
two the old policy and the I think the
 
06:22:37.110 --> 06:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
new one is just prescriptive for the for
 
06:22:39.708 --> 06:22:39.718 align:start position:0%
the old policy But it includes
 
06:22:43.390 --> 06:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
everything um that was in the old one
 
06:22:44.750 --> 06:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
just spells it out
 
06:22:46.868 --> 06:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
more further
 
06:22:49.788 --> 06:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
06:22:52.590 --> 06:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um actually it I don't
 
06:22:54.948 --> 06:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
think it does and that's the reason I I
 
06:22:57.030 --> 06:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
like the very small paragraph that we
 
06:22:59.270 --> 06:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
have now which I went and looked up it
 
06:23:01.030 --> 06:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
says the general court declares that it
 
06:23:03.310 --> 06:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
shall be the energy policy of the state
 
06:23:05.190 --> 06:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
to meet the energy needs of the citizens
 
06:23:07.030 --> 06:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
and businesses of the state at the
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
lowest reasonable cost while providing
 
06:23:11.548 --> 06:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
for reliability and diversity of energy
 
06:23:13.910 --> 06:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
resources to maximize the use of
 
06:23:15.750 --> 06:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
cost-effective Energy Efficiency and
 
06:23:17.868 --> 06:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
other demand side resources and to
 
06:23:19.310 --> 06:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
protect the safety and health of the
 
06:23:21.510 --> 06:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
citizens the physical environment of the
 
06:23:23.990 --> 06:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
state and the future supplies of
 
06:23:25.948 --> 06:23:25.958 align:start position:0%
resources with consideration of the
 
06:23:27.590 --> 06:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
financial stability of the state's
 
06:23:30.708 --> 06:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
utilities it is a fullsome statement of
 
06:23:32.750 --> 06:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
all of the stakeholders and all of the
 
06:23:34.948 --> 06:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
aspects of the energy Market Market
 
06:23:39.990 --> 06:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:42.910 --> 06:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
not further further
 
06:23:46.670 --> 06:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
discussion I recall that the consumer
 
06:23:50.990 --> 06:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
Advocate once described the existing 378
 
06:23:56.350 --> 06:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
colon 37 as a contradictory mishmash of
 
06:23:59.468 --> 06:23:59.478 align:start position:0%
ideas about State energy policy and he
 
06:24:04.510 --> 06:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
was right and that's why this
 
06:24:07.990 --> 06:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
amended version of State energy policy
 
06:24:12.708 --> 06:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
is much clearer and lays out exactly the
 
06:24:15.750 --> 06:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
principles that state government should
 
06:24:15.760 --> 06:24:16.670 align:start position:0%
principles that state government should
be

06:24:16.670 --> 06:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:24:19.310 --> 06:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
following as it tries to secure energy
 
06:24:20.910 --> 06:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
resources for its
 
06:24:23.910 --> 06:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
citizens the department of energy
 
06:24:27.430 --> 06:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill that this
 
06:24:31.628 --> 06:24:31.638 align:start position:0%
recitation of principles is much easier
 
06:24:34.548 --> 06:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
to understand and much more implement
 
06:24:36.590 --> 06:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
able for state government than the
 
06:24:39.708 --> 06:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
existing state energy
 
06:24:42.990 --> 06:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
policy so with that I would ask the
 
06:24:44.670 --> 06:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the question
 
06:24:47.590 --> 06:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass as amended on House

8 chair recognizes representative
 
06:26:54.548 --> 06:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
Harrington this is simply a matter of
 
06:26:57.628 --> 06:26:57.638 align:start position:0%
fairness we've had for for years now the
 
06:27:00.030 --> 06:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh Legacy telephone companies the sort
 
06:27:02.070 --> 06:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
of if you will left over from Bill uh
 
06:27:03.708 --> 06:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
from Mount Bell and then independent
 
06:27:05.948 --> 06:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
companies have been charged a very high
 
06:27:08.670 --> 06:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
assessment to be regulated by the Pu
 
06:27:10.670 --> 06:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
except the Pu doesn't regulate them
 
06:27:13.230 --> 06:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
neither does the department of energy um
 
06:27:15.310 --> 06:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
they have very little amount of
 
06:27:16.548 --> 06:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
Regulation that applies to them
 
06:27:18.110 --> 06:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
practically at all it's almost all gone
 
06:27:19.708 --> 06:27:19.718 align:start position:0%
away and this would drop their
 
06:27:24.750 --> 06:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
10% further discussion on House Bill
 
06:27:28.440 --> 06:27:31.708 align:start position:0%
10% further discussion on House Bill
58-

06:27:31.708 --> 06:27:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:34.830 --> 06:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
FN one question uh Mr chairman
 
06:27:36.910 --> 06:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead representative Harrington
 
06:27:40.230 --> 06:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:43.830 --> 06:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
the this is not as amended right so that
 
06:27:46.110 --> 06:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
was an issue that sounds like my fault I
 
06:27:48.270 --> 06:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
was supposed to get an amendment to you
 
06:27:50.190 --> 06:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
which I filed but I haven't gotten a
 
06:27:54.548 --> 06:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
copy of yet uh on which so yeah it's on
 
06:27:57.590 --> 06:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
line four where it says 33% is the
 
06:27:58.910 --> 06:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
chairman pointed out that should have
 
06:28:01.548 --> 06:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
been dropped down to 10% now I filed
 
06:28:03.468 --> 06:28:03.478 align:start position:0%
that one with OS but I haven't received
 
06:28:05.270 --> 06:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
anything so I we forgot about it I
 
06:28:06.830 --> 06:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
apologize to the committee I
 
06:28:08.310 --> 06:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
respectfully asked that we put this on
 
06:28:11.070 --> 06:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
hold until that can be
 
06:28:13.110 --> 06:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
fixed well thank you for pointing that
 
06:28:15.430 --> 06:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
out I recommend that we pass this bill
 
06:28:18.310 --> 06:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
and then ask the Senate to address that
 
06:28:21.390 --> 06:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
correction that be satisfactory to the
 
06:28:24.510 --> 06:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee normally I don't don't like to
 
06:28:26.430 --> 06:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
do that I don't like to ask the Senate
 
06:28:29.788 --> 06:28:29.798 align:start position:0%
to do our work for us but in this
 
06:28:33.270 --> 06:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
particular case because this kind of got
 
06:28:35.948 --> 06:28:35.958 align:start position:0%
fell through the TR s and we have a
 
06:28:38.590 --> 06:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
fairly significant schedule of bills
 
06:28:41.350 --> 06:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
still waiting our attention I'm going to
 
06:28:44.788 --> 06:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
suggest that we go ahead and uh adopt
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
this bill now and point out that error
 
06:28:50.270 --> 06:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and and ask them to
 
06:28:52.788 --> 06:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
address it representative
 
06:28:56.270 --> 06:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
bernardy and ALS another alternative is
 
06:28:58.830 --> 06:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
for the house to have a floor Amendment
 
06:29:01.150 --> 06:29:01.160 align:start position:0%
and address it so the house turns over a
 
06:29:04.270 --> 06:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
good bill to the Senate yeah I like
 
06:29:06.510 --> 06:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion i' forgot about that option I
 
06:29:07.830 --> 06:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
think that we'll do that so
 
06:29:10.270 --> 06:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington could we
 
06:29:11.910 --> 06:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
charge you with the responsibility of
 
06:29:14.830 --> 06:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that this turns into a house
 
06:29:18.230 --> 06:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
floor amendment by February 13 right
 
06:29:21.030 --> 06:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
away thank you okay thank
 
06:29:24.590 --> 06:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion
 
06:29:27.110 --> 06:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
needed seeing none I'll ask the clerk to
 
06:29:29.788 --> 06:29:29.798 align:start position:0%
call the role on the question of the
 
06:29:31.990 --> 06:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass on House Bill
 
06:29:35.788 --> 06:29:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:38.670 --> 06:29:38.680 align:start position:0%

8 and
 
06:30:36.110 --> 06:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
no I think we will not put this on
 
06:30:37.708 --> 06:30:37.718 align:start position:0%
consent because
 
06:30:41.270 --> 06:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
we we want to want to do a floor
 
06:30:44.990 --> 06:30:45.000 align:start position:0%

06:30:47.948 --> 06:30:47.958 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has who will
 
06:30:50.388 --> 06:30:50.398 align:start position:0%

06:30:55.830 --> 06:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility of crafting and
 
06:30:58.230 --> 06:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
introducing the floor
 
06:31:00.590 --> 06:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
amendment when when the time comes Mr
 
06:31:03.628 --> 06:31:03.638 align:start position:0%
chairman is a question in some advice um
 
06:31:03.638 --> 06:31:04.430 align:start position:0%
chairman is a question in some advice um
the

06:31:04.430 --> 06:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:31:07.110 --> 06:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
um committee report is is fairly simple
 
06:31:08.948 --> 06:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
to write but should I put in there that
 
06:31:11.310 --> 06:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
a mistake was made in the Drafting and a
 
06:31:12.788 --> 06:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment will be coming so that
 
06:31:14.670 --> 06:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's right in there and people see it up
 
06:31:17.430 --> 06:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
front yes I think that's acceptable by
 
06:31:23.030 --> 06:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:26.310 --> 06:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
yes all right so that concludes our work
 
06:31:30.190 --> 06:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 508 I close that executive
 
06:31:32.628 --> 06:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
session and now we'll open the executive
 
06:31:36.708 --> 06:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 4 and I recog I
 
06:31:40.310 --> 06:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
will make the um motion of ought to pass
 
06:31:42.670 --> 06:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill four and recognize
 
06:31:42.680 --> 06:31:44.510 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill four and recognize
representative

06:31:44.510 --> 06:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:31:47.670 --> 06:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
McGee yes I'd second that motion moved
 
06:31:49.510 --> 06:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
and seconded that we adopt the motion of
 
06:31:52.310 --> 06:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on Senate Bill
 
06:31:57.788 --> 06:31:57.798 align:start position:0%
four I will say that this
 
06:32:00.948 --> 06:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
legislation we think will finally make
 
06:32:05.388 --> 06:32:05.398 align:start position:0%
the cpay program actually work work and
 
06:32:06.788 --> 06:32:06.798 align:start position:0%
give people the
 
06:32:10.868 --> 06:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to finance for commercial
 
06:32:15.430 --> 06:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
buildings long range Energy Efficiency
 
06:32:18.190 --> 06:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
improvements which
 
06:32:20.830 --> 06:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
will not only improve the value of the
 
06:32:23.430 --> 06:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
building long range but also save energy
 
06:32:26.110 --> 06:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:28.750 --> 06:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
process the other possibility is that
 
06:32:32.150 --> 06:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
this bill will actually Aid the effort
 
06:32:34.548 --> 06:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
to provide more housing
 
06:32:37.230 --> 06:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
in the state affordable and
 
06:32:39.830 --> 06:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise by
 
06:32:44.310 --> 06:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
allowing buildings to be renovated not
 
06:32:46.948 --> 06:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
only for cosmetic purposes but also for
 
06:32:48.910 --> 06:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
 
06:32:51.510 --> 06:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
purposes will potentially allow more
 
06:32:53.830 --> 06:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
housing stock to be
 
06:32:56.670 --> 06:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
developed and provided in our state to
 
06:33:00.388 --> 06:33:00.398 align:start position:0%
ease our housing shortage so I think
 
06:33:02.708 --> 06:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
this is a valuable piece of legislation
 
06:33:05.230 --> 06:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
and I urge the rest of the committee to
 
06:33:07.868 --> 06:33:07.878 align:start position:0%
adopt it further
 
06:33:10.510 --> 06:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
06:33:13.548 --> 06:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I I'm I thought that we
 
06:33:16.070 --> 06:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
were told that it was uh commercial only
 
06:33:18.150 --> 06:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't know it would app to Residents
 
06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
and apartments but I thought that's what
 
06:33:22.750 --> 06:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
the administrator had said but anyways
 
06:33:24.548 --> 06:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against this bill because
 
06:33:26.388 --> 06:33:26.398 align:start position:0%
we haven't had it for it's been sitting
 
06:33:27.548 --> 06:33:27.558 align:start position:0%
around now for I don't know how many
 
06:33:29.948 --> 06:33:29.958 align:start position:0%
years 15 years we've done fine without
 
06:33:32.190 --> 06:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
it it's a new government program that
 
06:33:34.628 --> 06:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
basically says people aren't willing to
 
06:33:36.708 --> 06:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
loan this money unless we give them some
 
06:33:38.430 --> 06:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a deal from the government to do
 
06:33:39.910 --> 06:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
it and they say well there's no
 
06:33:41.310 --> 06:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
financing by the government there's no
 
06:33:42.788 --> 06:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
liability them what what is the
 
06:33:44.590 --> 06:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
government providing I don't see that
 
06:33:46.510 --> 06:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
they're providing anything and I just
 
06:33:48.590 --> 06:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't trust programs like this I think
 
06:33:50.388 --> 06:33:50.398 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's going to end up costing
 
06:33:52.830 --> 06:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
the the taxpayers with the local estate
 
06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
money or the rate payers money but if
 
06:33:57.548 --> 06:33:57.558 align:start position:0%
there was if there's a project out there
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
that's economically viable someone's
 
06:34:01.510 --> 06:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
willing to lend the money if they only
 
06:34:02.910 --> 06:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
lend the money when there's some kind of
 
06:34:05.190 --> 06:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
a trick way of Co collecting the
 
06:34:08.548 --> 06:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
finances when the state gets involved I
 
06:34:12.230 --> 06:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
I back off went in doubt voted
 
06:34:16.150 --> 06:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
out okay representative McGee thank you
 
06:34:18.190 --> 06:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um my understanding of the
 
06:34:20.670 --> 06:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
bill is that we're
 
06:34:23.510 --> 06:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
assisting with capital so that people
 
06:34:26.270 --> 06:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
can secure financing that makes sense in
 
06:34:27.948 --> 06:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
terms of the Investments that they're
 
06:34:30.670 --> 06:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
making and so it's been an idea that's
 
06:34:32.948 --> 06:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
been around the legislature for a long
 
06:34:34.948 --> 06:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
time we are the government so we don't
 
06:34:35.948 --> 06:34:35.958 align:start position:0%
have to talk about them like they're
 
06:34:38.910 --> 06:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else but there's no financing
 
06:34:40.190 --> 06:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
coming from the government there's no
 
06:34:41.910 --> 06:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
financing coming from the municipalities
 
06:34:44.548 --> 06:34:44.558 align:start position:0%
this is private dollars and so we heard
 
06:34:46.670 --> 06:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
all the testimony which I thought was
 
06:34:50.510 --> 06:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
excellent about um how opening up this
 
06:34:52.030 --> 06:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
access to Capital is really going to
 
06:34:54.270 --> 06:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
help people who want to finance these
 
06:34:56.430 --> 06:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
types of projects and I think it's a
 
06:34:59.468 --> 06:34:59.478 align:start position:0%
perfectly good use of of our Authority
 
06:35:01.830 --> 06:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
and also I think it's been vetted
 
06:35:03.230 --> 06:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
through the leadership on both sides of
 
06:35:04.510 --> 06:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
the house as well you know the
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
conversations have been that this is
 
06:35:07.388 --> 06:35:07.398 align:start position:0%
something that would be a useful thing
 
06:35:09.788 --> 06:35:09.798 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire economy so I don't
 
06:35:11.070 --> 06:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
think we need to fear that there's going
 
06:35:13.110 --> 06:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
to be any cost shifting if somebody
 
06:35:15.110 --> 06:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
takes a private
 
06:35:18.150 --> 06:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
loan Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
06:35:21.468 --> 06:35:21.478 align:start position:0%
chair um well I heard testimony that
 
06:35:23.830 --> 06:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
convinced me that uh the question was
 
06:35:27.670 --> 06:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
asked if is if there's default if the
 
06:35:31.830 --> 06:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
owner um passes away uh skattles uh
 
06:35:33.948 --> 06:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
maybe even if the house burns down who
 
06:35:36.190 --> 06:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
gets left holding the bill and the
 
06:35:38.430 --> 06:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
answer was that the lender would be
 
06:35:39.868 --> 06:35:39.878 align:start position:0%
responsible that the lender would lose
 
06:35:42.830 --> 06:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
out on money so I believe the state the
 
06:35:45.670 --> 06:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities are um are protected so I
 
06:35:47.190 --> 06:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
will be supporting this
 
06:35:50.548 --> 06:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
06:35:53.548 --> 06:35:53.558 align:start position:0%
Bernardi just to an answer the question
 
06:35:56.350 --> 06:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
about uh does it apply to housing it it
 
06:35:58.788 --> 06:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
does not apply to single family homes
 
06:36:02.230 --> 06:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
but if one is renovating the building to
 
06:36:05.868 --> 06:36:05.878 align:start position:0%
become an apartment complex or similar
 
06:36:05.878 --> 06:36:07.070 align:start position:0%
become an apartment complex or similar
housing

06:36:07.070 --> 06:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
housing
 
06:36:10.430 --> 06:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
situations uh I think the the monies are
 
06:36:13.948 --> 06:36:13.958 align:start position:0%
available for that kind of housing
 
06:36:17.510 --> 06:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:20.708 --> 06:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
discussion representative bney thank you
 
06:36:23.110 --> 06:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I have a question about
 
06:36:26.230 --> 06:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
the um if if one of these projects goes
 
06:36:28.868 --> 06:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
forward um is there any guarantee that
 
06:36:31.708 --> 06:36:31.718 align:start position:0%
there is efficiency gained and if some
 
06:36:34.628 --> 06:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
and if you know uh contractor runs up a
 
06:36:37.750 --> 06:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
huge bill and then the efficiency isn't
 
06:36:40.868 --> 06:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
isn't gained what happens is is is the
 
06:36:43.270 --> 06:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
home the property owner now on the hook
 
06:36:45.110 --> 06:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
for that and then they don't really
 
06:36:47.788 --> 06:36:47.798 align:start position:0%
benefit from the
 
06:36:51.788 --> 06:36:51.798 align:start position:0%
upgrade so that was a criticism of the
 
06:36:55.868 --> 06:36:55.878 align:start position:0%
former um versions of the cpce program
 
06:36:57.990 --> 06:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
and in some places around the country
 
06:37:00.708 --> 06:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
where cpce was adopted there were
 
06:37:03.030 --> 06:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous contractors who were taking
 
06:37:06.590 --> 06:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of the program to do shoddy
 
06:37:10.110 --> 06:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
work and get
 
06:37:13.510 --> 06:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
repaid based on the guarantees that were
 
06:37:16.350 --> 06:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
provided by earlier versions of the cpay
 
06:37:19.468 --> 06:37:19.478 align:start position:0%
program this version does not provide
 
06:37:21.030 --> 06:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
those kinds of
 
06:37:25.388 --> 06:37:25.398 align:start position:0%
protections uh if someone hires a an
 
06:37:27.468 --> 06:37:27.478 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency contractor who does
 
06:37:27.478 --> 06:37:29.110 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency contractor who does
lousy

06:37:29.110 --> 06:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
lousy
 
06:37:32.150 --> 06:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
work the lender is the one who would be
 
06:37:34.990 --> 06:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
on the hook
 
06:37:38.670 --> 06:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
for any kind of lawsuit or or inadequacy
 
06:37:41.468 --> 06:37:41.478 align:start position:0%
that that developed as a result of that
 
06:37:44.788 --> 06:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
shoty work so it's it's not going to
 
06:37:45.990 --> 06:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
come back
 
06:37:48.708 --> 06:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
on the state or the
 
06:37:51.350 --> 06:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
municipality does that answer your
 
06:37:53.388 --> 06:37:53.398 align:start position:0%
question does it come back on to the
 
06:37:53.398 --> 06:37:58.910 align:start position:0%
question does it come back on to the
property

06:37:58.910 --> 06:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:02.230 --> 06:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
owner by come back on do you mean is it
 
06:38:04.350 --> 06:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
the property owners responsibility
 
06:38:06.990 --> 06:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately yes I mean in in the places
 
06:38:08.750 --> 06:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
in other places where they have had the
 
06:38:10.750 --> 06:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
PACE program and then had to cancel it
 
06:38:12.948 --> 06:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
because of the fraud that you mentioned
 
06:38:15.510 --> 06:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
um how does this prevent that sort of
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
fraud from where somebody you know runs
 
06:38:20.628 --> 06:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
up a Big Bill uh and then doesn't
 
06:38:24.468 --> 06:38:24.478 align:start position:0%
actually deliver the efficiency that was
 
06:38:27.468 --> 06:38:27.478 align:start position:0%
promised well since the government is
 
06:38:30.270 --> 06:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
not directly Evol involved then it would
 
06:38:32.990 --> 06:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
be the responsibility of the owner of
 
06:38:34.270 --> 06:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
the building
 
06:38:37.150 --> 06:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
and the lender who lent the money to
 
06:38:41.670 --> 06:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:46.270 --> 06:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
fraud further discussion representative
 
06:38:49.388 --> 06:38:49.398 align:start position:0%
PL thank you chair um what hasn't
 
06:38:52.070 --> 06:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
brought up and I'm going to be voting
 
06:38:56.110 --> 06:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
for the bill is in the back of my head
 
06:38:58.868 --> 06:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
this is a pro banking bill because we
 
06:39:03.468 --> 06:39:03.478 align:start position:0%
are eliminating a lot of um
 
06:39:05.510 --> 06:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
bankruptcies because they will get it
 
06:39:08.590 --> 06:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
from some owner so the risk is minimal
 
06:39:11.590 --> 06:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
to a bank to loan this I voted for it
 
06:39:14.990 --> 06:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
just because this does push forward with
 
06:39:16.910 --> 06:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
that one minor thing it's helping the
 
06:39:20.270 --> 06:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
banks in the bankruptcy it'll go forward
 
06:39:22.948 --> 06:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does need a lot of
 
06:39:26.510 --> 06:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
buildings to be renovated for
 
06:39:28.548 --> 06:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
efficiency it was
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
testified I think by James key Wallace
 
06:39:35.270 --> 06:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
that these loans follow the building not
 
06:39:37.350 --> 06:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
the owner of the building and that's one
 
06:39:40.270 --> 06:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
of the advantages of this program
 
06:39:42.430 --> 06:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
06:39:46.388 --> 06:39:46.398 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman um yes th
 
06:39:48.510 --> 06:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for for that statement that's
 
06:39:53.590 --> 06:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
correct and that is one of the major
 
06:39:58.310 --> 06:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
elements of of this Innovative um policy
 
06:40:02.948 --> 06:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
and I guess uh structure that this that
 
06:40:05.270 --> 06:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
this law is going to
 
06:40:08.670 --> 06:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
enable um it's interesting Mr chairman
 
06:40:10.830 --> 06:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
that your your the amendment to the
 
06:40:13.150 --> 06:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
energy policy bill and I said I
 
06:40:14.868 --> 06:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
appreciated it that you included the
 
06:40:16.750 --> 06:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
term Market
 
06:40:19.910 --> 06:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
transformation uh this is an example of
 
06:40:22.548 --> 06:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
that kind of Market transformation the
 
06:40:24.948 --> 06:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
the policy Innovation that's being put
 
06:40:24.958 --> 06:40:25.830 align:start position:0%
the policy Innovation that's being put
in

06:40:25.830 --> 06:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:40:31.070 --> 06:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
is for the commercial building owners
 
06:40:33.788 --> 06:40:33.798 align:start position:0%
loan uh to be
 
06:40:36.708 --> 06:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh one attached to the property rather
 
06:40:41.230 --> 06:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
than uh remain as a as as a personal
 
06:40:44.230 --> 06:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
liability and number two for the
 
06:40:47.830 --> 06:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
repayment of that loan to be aligned or
 
06:40:51.388 --> 06:40:51.398 align:start position:0%
or facilitated by the by the
 
06:40:53.910 --> 06:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
municipality uh and get the loan is
 
06:40:55.230 --> 06:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
going to get paid along with the
 
06:40:59.388 --> 06:40:59.398 align:start position:0%
property taxes so as as the chairman
 
06:41:01.628 --> 06:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
said introducing the bill it's going
 
06:41:04.350 --> 06:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
to facilitate
 
06:41:07.310 --> 06:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
property owners in overcoming the
 
06:41:11.350 --> 06:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
classic market failure that that
 
06:41:15.388 --> 06:41:15.398 align:start position:0%
um that bevil's Energy Efficiency which
 
06:41:18.628 --> 06:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
is the long-term nature of the payback
 
06:41:19.990 --> 06:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:41:24.110 --> 06:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh Investments
 
06:41:27.788 --> 06:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
not not being felt by the building owner
 
06:41:30.788 --> 06:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
right apartment owners generally don't
 
06:41:32.350 --> 06:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
upgrade efficiency because they don't
 
06:41:35.070 --> 06:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
pay the energy bills usually the the um
 
06:41:37.948 --> 06:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
residents pay the energy bills so
 
06:41:40.468 --> 06:41:40.478 align:start position:0%
commercial building owners are are you
 
06:41:43.230 --> 06:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
know tend not to make those those
 
06:41:46.510 --> 06:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
upgrades they don't bear the the cost it
 
06:41:49.510 --> 06:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
makes apartment dwellers have high
 
06:41:51.750 --> 06:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
utility bills which is is a problem in
 
06:41:53.868 --> 06:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
our state where we have high housing
 
06:41:56.590 --> 06:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
costs and and affordability so this is
 
06:41:57.990 --> 06:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
going to address that it's part of
 
06:42:01.270 --> 06:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
Market transformation and I applaud the
 
06:42:03.750 --> 06:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
work that's been done on it by as was
 
06:42:05.830 --> 06:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned bipartisan
 
06:42:08.150 --> 06:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
effort further
 
06:42:11.310 --> 06:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Harrington
 
06:42:12.510 --> 06:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
I'll make this quick because I don't
 
06:42:14.190 --> 06:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
want to be overly redundant but it's
 
06:42:16.708 --> 06:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
what we have is a program here that says
 
06:42:19.230 --> 06:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
people that would normally be able to
 
06:42:21.070 --> 06:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
get loans through the market by going
 
06:42:23.070 --> 06:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
out and saying this is what I want to do
 
06:42:25.590 --> 06:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
and negotiate with the bank to get it
 
06:42:27.230 --> 06:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
cannot get the loan because the bank
 
06:42:28.910 --> 06:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't think it's a good investment but
 
06:42:31.230 --> 06:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
somehow getting the government involved
 
06:42:33.350 --> 06:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
it makes that a good investment I just
 
06:42:35.468 --> 06:42:35.478 align:start position:0%
that's that's ripe for corruption that's
 
06:42:38.270 --> 06:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
ripe for uh problems and I can also
 
06:42:40.628 --> 06:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
assure you of one thing is almost as
 
06:42:42.310 --> 06:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
sure as I am the Sun is going to come up
 
06:42:44.310 --> 06:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow next year the year after
 
06:42:46.190 --> 06:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
whenever they'll be back here saying oh
 
06:42:48.310 --> 06:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
this program is wonderful but it doesn't
 
06:42:50.868 --> 06:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
help low-income people enough so we have
 
06:42:52.868 --> 06:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
to subsidize their loans through this
 
06:42:55.070 --> 06:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
program or it doesn't help people in
 
06:42:57.270 --> 06:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
some kind of neighborhood or we just got
 
06:42:59.030 --> 06:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
to expand it and spend a little bit more
 
06:43:00.430 --> 06:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
money from the government it'll be so
 
06:43:02.350 --> 06:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful this is the nose under the
 
06:43:05.830 --> 06:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:07.670 --> 06:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
