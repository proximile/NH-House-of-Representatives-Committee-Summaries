00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
transcends party lines and speaks to the
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights of every individual
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am the prime sponsor of
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
ca23 which explicitly protects abortion
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
up to 24 weeks and after allows doctors
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
to work with their patients to make
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
these complicated decisions this
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment takes abortion
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
out of our hands as politicians and puts
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
it where it belongs with doctors and
 
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:40.430 align:start position:0%
it where it belongs with doctors and
with

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
patients as many of you are aware the
 
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
landscape of Reproductive Rights in
 
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
America shifted dramatically since the
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court overturned Row versus Wade
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
in June of
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
20122 in the wake of this court decision
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
all federal protections for abort
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
abortion have been eliminated and the
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility has now fallen to the
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
states to protect abortion rights and
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
over the past 18 months we have
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
witnessed an alarming Trend Across the
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
Nation with already more than 20 States
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
having enacted abortion
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
bans while abortion is currently safe
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
and legal in New Hampshire to dat there
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
is no right to abortion and New
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lawmakers have refused to take
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
action to make abortion an explicit
 
00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:35.959 align:start position:0%
right that means that we have zero state
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
or federal Protections in place that
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
Safeguard the right to an abortion so
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
even though abortion is currently legal
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
until 24 weeks in New Hampshire we are
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
just one election away from abortion
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
rights being further restricted or even
 
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
eliminated we want to change that today
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
we are joining with our colleagues from
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
across the aisle to propose a
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that will when
 
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
passed enshrine protections for safe
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
legal abortion in the New Hampshire
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution last year I introduced cacr
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
protecting reproductive freedom in the
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
past year I've worked hard with some of
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
the nation's leading civil liberties and
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights attorneys from
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organizations to draft a
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
bill that is specific to the needs of
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and took into
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
consideration the feedback I received
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
from this
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee we believe that everyone
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
deserves the right and ability to make
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
their own decisions about pregnancy in
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
consultation with their trusted health
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
care provider this constitutional
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
amendment protects abortion and puts the
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
decision in the hands of patients and
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
health care providers not
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
politicians I stand here today as one of
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
the millions of people who have received
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
abortion care I had my abortion as a
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
teenager and it has allowed me to lead
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
the life I have lived go to college to
 
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279 align:start position:0%

their physical and emotional needs
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
we know that a super majority of granite
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
Staters support abortion rights and they
 
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
do not believe that the government
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
should interfere in a woman's ability to
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
make her own personal decisions New
 
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a long bipartisan history
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
of supporting privacy when it comes to
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
personal medical decisions this
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan proposal represents these
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
Granite State values and is sponsored
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
and supported by Republicans
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
Democrats and
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
independents regardless of your personal
 
00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
beliefs on abortion I would encourage
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
you to vote for this cacr so that the
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire can weigh in on
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
this ballot measure and we no longer
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
need to debate this issue annually let's
 
00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
let the granite Staters decide thank you
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
so much for your time thank you
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the committee
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
Kat thank you chair but thank you for
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question was it your intention
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
to have abortion be legal after 24 weeks
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
through birth for reasons Beyond life of
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
the mother and fatal fenal anomalies as
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
is in Statue now or would you be
 
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
supportive of an amendment to be in
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
alignment with the current statute thank
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
you for the question abortion up until
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
birth doesn't happen it's an
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
inflammatory statement and we have lots
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
of providers here to testify today on
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
that complicated topic and to set the
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
record straight I trust providers in New
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I trust that the voters
 
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
trust providers and patients and that's
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
what this cacr is all about thank you
 
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
follow yes follow
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
up so then you would be okay with
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
amending to state that it would be legal
 
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
per the current
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
statute we don't so I do not believe
 
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
that this needs to be amended I believe
 
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
it is perfectly written as is by the
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
states by the Nations not just the
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
states the nation's leading civil
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
liberties and civil rights attorneys to
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
protect the patient provider
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
relationship and I trust doctors and I
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
believe that if we give this to the
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
voters which we should that they do too
 
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so much other questions for
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
this wi yes representative
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you for taking my question
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
weeks we
 
00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:07.189 align:start position:0%
weeks we
believe

00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:11.990 align:start position:0%
that the
current

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
statue it doesn't protect not that we
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
believe we know we are the only state in
 
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
New England that does not have any
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
protections either in law or the
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution to protect abortion rights
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
and so it is really necessary we don't
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
want to go backwards we want to move
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
forward and we want to make it so
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
doctors and their patients can make
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
these decisions throughout pregnancy
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
free from politicians as most New
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constituents do thank you so
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
weeks because the current statue right
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
now restricts
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
and penalizes doctors at that juncture
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
and the majority of granite Staters are
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
alarmed by that Trend and they trust
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
Physicians they trust physicians in
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
their patients and we should trust them
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
by putting this as a ballot measure and
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
there are Physicians here today who will
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
speak to that in Greater detail about
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
why this decision should be left with
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
them and their patients in order to
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
serve them to the best of their ability
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question other
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
 
00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:38.550 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
representative

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
stapl thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
question on the bill page
 
00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
question on the bill page
one

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.430 align:start position:0%
one
line

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
19 says after 24 weeks the state may not
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit an abortion that in the
 
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
professional Judgment of an attending
 
00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.389 align:start position:0%
professional Judgment of an attending
physician

00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
physician
 
00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:00.910 align:start position:0%
physician
is

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
necessary The Physician shall apply the
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
applicable standard of care in making a
 
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.389 align:start position:0%
applicable standard of care in making a
professional

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
judgment but the are are there not some
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
other things missing like the presence
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
of a medical
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
emergency um the explanation of a reason
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
for that physician
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
decision or even for a a second opinion
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
by another
 
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
physician are any of those things
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable to include in the in the
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
absence of what we have
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
here we believe that this amendment is
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly written and that it represents
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
what Granite Staters have called on us
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
to do which is to trust doctors to make
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
these decisions in consultation with
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
their patients and it does not need to
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
be amended in any way shape or form
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
question yes follow up represent
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
Stapleton and then representative Devon
 
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
thank you what I was what I was getting
 
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.870 align:start position:0%
thank you what I was what I was getting
at

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
um there's no differentiation between an
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
elective abortion and one for medical or
 
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
elective abortion and one for medical or
emergency

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
reasons um we're absent of type and
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
print here on this bill to
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
explain it's all up to one person one
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
explain it's all up to one person one
physician

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
physician
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
not even to the mother or the father or
 
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.150 align:start position:0%
not even to the mother or the father or
the

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
family we believe that this actually
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
does keep the sanctity of the patient
 
00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
provider relationship at the Forefront
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
of this discussion and that's exactly
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
where it should be not with legislators
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
and again we have many providers here
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
today who can speak to that in Greater
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
detail about why that is such an
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
essential component of this C ACR thank
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
you representative Devon well set all
 
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
right any other questions from any other
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
so I guess I have two questions um and I
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
should say uh this my first question was
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention by another
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative I I thought very
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately um it says in the First on
 
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
line three every individual has a
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to abortion if you
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
leave the wording that way does that
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
mean that the father has a fundamental
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
right to demand de either demand or
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
object to an abortion for the
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
mother this is actually very clearly
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
written for the patient so for the
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
person whose body it belongs to um it's
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
your body your choice and consultation
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
with your provider thank you so you you
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
think that that language is clear that
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
it is only the person who is pregnant
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
that can it is the pregnant person and
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
then after 24 weeks in consultation with
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
their provider okay although it doesn't
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
say the pregnant person it says every
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
individual so again if the you don't
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
think that that at least raises a
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
question that somebody could make the
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
argument that it didn't I believe that
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
the attorneys that wrote this are
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
correct in that it is about the patient
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
and making these decisions in
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
consultation with their providers and
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
we'll have many expert Witnesses
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
today reiterating that point okay thank
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
you the next question I have is this the
 
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.230 align:start position:0%
you the next question I have is this the
next

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
line says the state cannot prohibit
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
restrict delay or penalize the right uh
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
prior to 24 weeks unless it is justified
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
by a compelling State interest achieved
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
by the least restrictive means and I
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
guess my question
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
is that last part is not in current law
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
so so is if we were if the voters were
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
to pass this amendment would they
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
actually be placing more restrictions on
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
abortion than exist now under current
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
law because the current law doesn't say
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
you can prohibit abortion before 2 24
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
weeks if there's a compelling State
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
interest as I understand the current law
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
it says prior to 24 weeks if a woman
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
wants to have an abortion she has the
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
abortion and nobody has a right to ask
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know anything about is there a
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
compelling reason for this or not
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
actually under the current law abortion
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
is not proactively protected as a right
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what this does and we
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
have expert Witnesses today who can
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
speak to that in Greater detail but
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
again this was written by some of the
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
leading civil rights and civil liberties
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the nation explicitly with
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
the goal of protecting abortion rights
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
and the sanctity of the patient provider
 
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
relationship and the majority a super
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
majority of granite skaters support it
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
and when you go and I hope you do and
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
you look at the signin for
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
today the people have spoken that they
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
want you to
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
cacr and I hope you give them
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that and I'll be
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
handing out again it's not one party
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's bipartisan this is co-sponsored in
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan way and I'm going to be
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
handing out in addition to Senator
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
Fenton gave me testimony and so did
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
Senator Cindy Rosenwald but John winter
 
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.590 align:start position:0%
Senator Cindy Rosenwald but John winter
who

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
is was the Republican nominee for
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
Walpole and a former Vice chair of the
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
Walpole Republicans has given me his
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
testimony too so we know in our state
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
that across party lines constituents are
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
asking for this and so we should come
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
together and give the voters the
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in and decide for
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you so much for the
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
question any other questions all right
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
see seeing none thank you very much um
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on representative
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
for hearing uh some information I wanted
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
to pass on on this cacr 23 could I just
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
ask you to get a little closer to the
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
mic please so we thank you even closer
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay there you go it's like I'm meating
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
the mic here um I think representative
 
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
Lynn you were actually keying on this
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill I think it's actually poorly
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
written and and one of the key things I
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
picked up on was every individual
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
all right I'm an
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
individual every individual has a
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to abortion can I get
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
an abortion I I don't know that any man
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
in the world that can get an abortion so
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
what this doesn't make sense to put into
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
our constitution every individual can
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
have a right to
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
abortion further down I just want to
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
State and show off here it says after 24
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
weeks the state may may not prohibit an
 
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
abortion okay so that's saying they want
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
to actually allow abortion up until
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
birth I mean why does someone want to
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
kill a baby up until birth I mean if
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's an medical emergency I think we
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
already got that covered I don't know
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
why we want to kill the baby up until
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
birth and then it goes on a little bit
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
further on there line seven it actually
 
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
talks about applicable standard of
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
care well we've seen through
 
00:23:59.789 --> 00:23:59.799 align:start position:0%
covid one doctor says it's a vaccine one
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
says it's not one says the vaccine works
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
one says it doesn't one says the mass
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
worked one says it doesn't what what is
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
the standard of care it's it's very
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
people I'm with this abortion the
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
government is saying it has the
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
authority to allow one group of people
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
to kill another group of people based on
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
Prejudice with the bill with this bill
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
the state is forcing its citizens to
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
take part in an immoral
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
act to pass the bill would be to bypass
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
the moral code of the individual and
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
would conscript the taxpayers at large
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
to fund what is against their
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
conscience I mean just think about a
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
little bit I mean you you're saying well
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's no money technically but we
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
could be funding abortion clinics or
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
clinics in that sense and uh in Grants
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
and tax money we
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
collect but at the same time just us
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
being here making $100 a year it's
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
costing the taxpayers to actually pass
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
this constitution
 
00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment article two I just want to
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
read it and I'm sure everybody's well
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
aware of it natural rights all men have
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
certain natural essential inherit rights
 
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
among which are the enjoying and
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
defending life and
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
Liberty defending life and
 
00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
Liberty not killing life but defending
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
it it goes on to say acquiring
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
possessions acquiring possessing in
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
protecting property and in a word of
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
seeking and obtaining happiness equality
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
of rights under the law shall not be
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
denied or bridged by the state on
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
account of race Creed color sex or
 
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.830 align:start position:0%
account of race Creed color sex or
natural

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
natural
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
origin again I think by that first
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
sentence of everyone of
 
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
everybody has a fundamental right to
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
abortion is actually excluding me
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
there's no way I can get an abortion
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
there's just no way this is not a bill
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
for everybody I think the bill really
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
needs to be re Rewritten Rewritten and
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
thought through a little bit more I will
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
be testifying this afternoon and I get
 
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
plenty more information on this and I'll
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
be sharing it back then but last piece
 
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
I'd say is that we know there's you can
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
look at different Supreme Court rulings
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
and things of that sort and they kicked
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
it back to the states to
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
um for respect for in preservation of
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
personal life at all stages of
 
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
development they kicked it back to us to
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
decide what that is and I'm saying right
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
now Life Starts at conception
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't start at week 2 week 15
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
week 24 week 36 or any place in between
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
or if you feel like uh the baby's now
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
moving it's alive and it's not alive
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
it's a baby all right thank you I will
 
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
take questions but it is hard for me to
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
hear with my disability so I'll do my
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
best in hearing the questions if you
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%

want to ask thank you uh questions for
this

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%

you once again as a man I was unsure
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
that I had something to offer to a
 
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about reproductive Healthcare
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
once again again I decided that speaking
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this bill which will
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
enshrine the New Hampshire in the New

Hampshire Constitution a woman's right
 
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
to make healthc care decisions in
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
collaboration with their doctor was an
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
opport opportunity to honor three
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
generations of amazing women in my
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
life my mom my wife and my
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
daughters when I was a very young adult
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
my first serious girlfriend became
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
pregnant we were not ready we were
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
scared and I admit I was
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
clueless when my girlfriend chose to
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
have an abortion it was my mother who
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
came to her side taking her to the
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
clinic coming to our apart our apartment
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
to offer healing and support probably
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
food as well and most important lending
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
her strength communicating by the force
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
of her very nature that there was no
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
reason to feel
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
ashamed fast forward 10 years another
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
unplanned pregnancy my wife and I knew
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
knew we wanted children but we were once
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
again less than prepared I was a student
 
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
we were poor we were betwix and between
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
several life
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
transitions we wrestled with what to do
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
could we provide the stability a child
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
needed would we have resources to give
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
our child the life that they deserved
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
the discussions were long hard
 
00:29:24.509 --> 00:29:24.519 align:start position:0%
excruciating my wife Nikki was a beacon
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
of strength confidence and faith in the
 
00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.310 align:start position:0%
of strength confidence and faith in the
future

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
today our daughter is
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
38 we are thankful every day for her and
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
her sister and our two
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
grandchildren we know that our daughters
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
will have to wrestle with difficult
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
life-altering medical situations in fact
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
they already
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
have we have full confidence in them my
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
mom and my wife taught them that women
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
are fully capable of making the right
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves about their
 
00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:57.519 align:start position:0%
bodies their health care and their well
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
witness yes uh representative Perez
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
did the option of adoption ever enter
 
00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:22.669 align:start position:0%
did the option of adoption ever enter
your

00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
mind putting a child having a child and
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
putting them up for adoption we have
 
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
thousands millions of people who would
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
child that is a very personal decision
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
and a a very personal discussion um in
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
my case this situation was over 50 years
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
ago and I cannot honestly say and and I
 
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
was very anxious about the whole
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
situation was a very young person and so
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
I think that adoption is a a a
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
a perfectly fine alternative that people
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
should consider um I can't really I
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak about what I
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
considered at that
 
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:09.559 align:start position:0%
point other questions for this witness
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
Oregon so this um we this bill does uh
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
guarantee uh women or which uh the um or
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
I could say pregnant person with the uh
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
right to abortion in a medical emergency
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
and um as as you know the process of
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is not a simple one and I know
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
in this was many years ago it was uh a
 
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
member member of my family uh came in at
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
you know like a week like a week before
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
the due date and they discovered that
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
the uh they discovered that the child's
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
heart was not beating that was many
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
years ago before they have all that
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
technology they have now so and um and
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
those cases still happen today so do do
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
you feel like a would you say that that
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
language is necessary to protect people
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
like like my relative who in that tragic
 
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
situation where um you know even you
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
know we're even like very very late in
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy and emergency comes up and
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
and um they have to uh you know you know
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
the baby is not viable even like after
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
thanks I'm not exactly sure of what the
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
question is but what I will say is that
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
um having children um for me has been
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
the greatest joy of my life and um I'm
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
well aware that for others in other
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
situation it also brings heartbreaking
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
situations and Incredibly difficult um
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
decisions and um I think that this
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment will allow
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
people with in collaboration with their
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
doctors to make decisions for themselves
 
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
um which I trust them to do thank I
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
this issue while often politicized has
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
not been abstract to me
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect some balancing rights
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
that occur somewhere on a piece of
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
paper it doesn't affect an abstract
 
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
woman that we can all imagine as we have
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
debated each change to abortion rights
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
in this state I have been at times 22 24
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
and 27 weeks pregnant as we have had
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
that conversation as anyone who is
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
pregnant knows the tragedies we are
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
talking about in this conversation are
 
00:34:53.879 --> 00:34:55.109 align:start position:0%
talking about in this conversation are
not

00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
theoretical as a pregnant mother mother
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
wake up every day and frankly so many
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
times during the night worrying about
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
your baby you take innumerable steps
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
each day you drink decaf coffee take
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
vitamins eat fruits and vegetables you
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
avoid alcohol deli meat Sushi soft
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
cheeses too much sugar and other things
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
every day because every day and every
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
minute you think about the baby it lives
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
inside of your body and you are a mom
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
each decision I have made during my
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
three pregnancies starting from the
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
moment I knew my baby was with me could
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
hurt them it could help them it could
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
protect them and that was
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
true that was true from the first
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
moments until if I'm lucky I will see my
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
baby girls grow old be happy as each of
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
you have always done for your children
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
we care for these as parents this cacr
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
gives respect it gives respect to the
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
women who bear the important
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility in our society of
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
carrying our society's children and
 
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
their right to personal physical
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
autonomy I was so lucky so far not to
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
find out that something had gone wrong
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
with any of my babies while I carried
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
them I cannot tell you the worry I've
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
had and how like so many other mothers
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
and terribly Sad Stories We Have Heard
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
it would simply break my
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
heart but if that were ever to happen
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
the best person to make any incredibly
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and complex decision in that
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
moment is me with my my spouse with my
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
partner we have the ability to consult
 
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
with our trusted medical providers and

we don't need any other help today this
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
body will decide whether to ask our
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
voters to trust me to trust your
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
ballot New Hampshire is one of three
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
states where abortion is legal but not
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
protected and New Hampshire is the only
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
state in New England without this
 
00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:07.430 align:start position:0%
state in New England without this
affirmative

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
affirmative
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
right without explicit State protections
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
for abortion in statute or in the
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution the urgency is real for my
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
constituents according to recent polling
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
87% of granite Staters support
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom and do not want
 
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
State officials to place restrictions on
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire we also have a
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
long and bipartisan tradition of direct
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
democracy and allowing voters to decide
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
for themselves the issues that most
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
impact their
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
lives we have an obligation to our
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
constituents the overwhelming majority
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
of whom believe that decisions about
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
reproductive and abortion care belong to
 
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
pregnant people and the people who
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
provide them
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
care without the federal protections
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
that r Wade provided before it was
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
overturned granted Staters no abortion
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
is now not protected at the state level
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
and not sure if they will continue to
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
have access to the care they need in New
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even more so many fear what
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
the future will look like for their
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
children and their
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
grandchildren it may seem that these
 
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
fears are
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
overstated but most of my constituents
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
watch the national
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
news they have watched as state after
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
State across the country has banned
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
abortion early in pregnancy before
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
people even know that they are pregnant
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
and in some cases banned abortion
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
completely they have heard the stories
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
of women needing to travel to other
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
states and having to wait days or even
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
weeks to access care because their home
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
state has an abortion
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
ban and they have heard stories of women
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
going to court to appeal under
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
exceptions in their State's laws to then
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
be denied by their state court and have
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
to flee to another
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
state in a time when many people are
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
uncertain about so many things including
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing and child care to
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
name a few losing control over your body
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
and the ability to make decisions about
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
the security of your family's future is
 
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
scary as a mother myself I understand
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
these fears there's no decision more
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
more critical than if when and how to
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
start and grow a
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
family I trust patience to make these
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
decisions and I trust doctors to support
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
them and to provide Compassionate Care
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
there is no place in the legislature for
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
these personal and private
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
decisions our constituents deserve the
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make their voices heard I
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote ought to pass on cacr
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
23 to send this to the voters of New
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Perez thank
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
you um it was stated earlier that no
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
abortions are performed over 24 weeks I
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
don't know where that information come
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
do you know of anyone in the state of
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who has been denied an
 
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
abortion up to 24 weeks up under the
 
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.790 align:start position:0%
abortion up to 24 weeks up under the
present

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
statute so there are two things that I I
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
think you asked there um no just one
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay it was a preface um do I know let
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
me just clarify it's a little I'm having
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
a little trouble hearing so as much as
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
you can lean into the microphones that
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
would help me do you know you say
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
abortion is not protected under the
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
present uh fetal Life protection act do
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
you know of
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
anyone who has been denied an abortion
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
up to 24 weeks in the state of New
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under the present fetal Life
 
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.550 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under the present fetal Life
protection

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
act thank you for the question I'm going
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
to ask you to um ask that with a
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
provider I think that the doctors who
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
work with women on a daily basis are
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to answer that question
 
00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:13.829 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to answer that question
thank

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
you yes representative
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
k um was it your intention in
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring can you just a little bit
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
closer thanks was it your intention in
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring this to allow abortion to
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
be legal for reasons Beyond life of the
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
mother or fatal fetal anomalies as is in
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
current statue now or would you be
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
supportive of amending to be in
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
alignment with current statute to allow
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
up until 24 weeks and then beyond that
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
with exceptions for the life of the
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
mother or fatal fetal anomalies so that
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
it wasn't elective only abortion after
 
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.150 align:start position:0%
it wasn't elective only abortion after
24

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
weeks um so let me State clearly I'm not
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
sure what elective means but uh abortion
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen after 24 weeks except in
 
00:43:05.069 --> 00:43:05.079 align:start position:0%
consultation with the medical provider
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
what we would like is for that to be in
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
statute that doctors would be able to
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
use their best judgment their best
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
medical judgment in helping people who
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
are pregnant go through complicated um
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
testing and decision making about what
 
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
to do about their pregnancy if it
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
becomes complicated after 24 weeks right
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
now they there are um criminal penalties
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
for doctors and providers after 24 weeks
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
um that make it very difficult for for
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
doctors to adhere to best practices with
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
um without Clarity there so my hope is
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
that it would be more clear that this is
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
a kind of decision that belongs not to
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
politicians but to Providers and
 
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.750 align:start position:0%
politicians but to Providers and
pregnant

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
people yes follow up you stated that
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
abortion at after 24 weeks doesn't
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
happen and I just I wanted to ask are
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
you aware of the boulder Care Clinic in
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
Colorado that allows abortion for any
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
reason after 24
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
weeks um so I'm sorry if I if I said
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
that what I'm thought I said and I will
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
clarify is that um abortion after 24
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
weeks only happens when there's
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
complicated situations and a pregnant
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
person is under the care of their
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
medical provider and so so I'm going to
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
ask you to follow up your question with
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
medical providers that deal with these
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
complicated situations after 24 weeks I
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
am speaking to what happens in New
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm unfamiliar with what
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
Colorado other questions for this
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
maners thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
question representative Simpson I
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
believe you testified that can you a
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
little bit closer to the microphone
 
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
thanks I believe that you testified that
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire abortion is legal but
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
not protected and I wondered if you
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
could expand upon that
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
please sure so right now in statute
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that says the right to
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
an abortion is protected up until 24
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
weeks in fact the fetal Life protection
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
act says the opposite nothing about this
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
act it says nothing about this act
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
should be construed as a right to
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
abortion and so our constituents are
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
very clear what that means which is that
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
the government
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
legislators could potentially interfere
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
before with
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
legislation of another abortion ban
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
earlier than 24 weeks at any time what
 
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:47.559 align:start position:0%
they would like is for the government to
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
be out of
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
decisions about abortion care and in
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
which I tried to do last year and folks
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
said they wanted it to go to the voters
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
so this year I co-sponsored this bill
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
saying let's let's see what the voters
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
want let's let them decide what should
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
law does follow up representative
 
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
V thank you so cacr 23 would assure that
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
abortion is both legal and protected in
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank you for the question
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
crca cacr 23 would ensure that it was
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
both abortion care was both legal and
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
protected in the law yeah other
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
scripts yes representative
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
trip uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
so uh it it appears that uh just a
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
little bit closer presumption
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
say again we can't hear if you can be a
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
little closer to the microphone thanks
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yeah right it it
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
appears that you have a presumption that
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
once uh abortion is placed in the
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution that it's
 
00:47:13.839 --> 00:47:16.470 align:start position:0%
Constitution that it's
protected

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
protected
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh and but you and the reason for this
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
is that uh uh if it's not in the
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution that it could be repealed
 
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.309 align:start position:0%
Constitution that it could be repealed
or

00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
amended uh so do you presume that once
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's in the
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution it is safe and won't be
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
removed by subsequent
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
legislators thank you for the question I
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
presume it that it will be as safe as we
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
can make
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay I'll reintroduce
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
myself so you can hear the correct
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
pronunciation of my name I'm Katie
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
peternell state representative represent
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
wolfboro and Tuftonboro in the beautiful
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region I am also a tri chair of
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
the pro-life caucus I'm here to speak in
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
opposition to cacr um 23 I believe um
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
that this is a little too soon to be
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
presenting this cacr the fetal Life
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
protection act is only 2 years old and I
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
can testify that when I was campaigning
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
for office um because people knew that I
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
was a pro-life candidate one of the
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
first questions they always asked me was
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
about abortion and what my stance was
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
and I would immediately reply ask with
 
00:48:56.109 --> 00:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
the question of do do you know what the
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
current law is in the state of New
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and every single time the
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
answer was no and I had to explain the
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
current Statute in our state and every
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
single time with one exception with one
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
very angry person who thought that
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
abortion up until the moment of birth
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
was completely
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
acceptable except for that one angry
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
person every single voter told told me
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
that they thought 24 weeks was already
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
extreme and that they would walk it back
 
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.430 align:start position:0%
extreme and that they would walk it back
to

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
15 every single person said 24 weeks was
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
pregnancy so one of the other one of my
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
issues with the um with the cacr is I'm
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
not really sure what everyone means and
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
when I first read it my initial thought
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
was does that mean a man has a right to
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
an abortion and if a man has a right to
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
an abortion does that mean he has a
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
right to coerce his partner into an
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
abortion I found that very confusing I
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
have been told that that couldn't
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
possibly happen but I find that very
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
hard to believe I think this is a very
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
slippery slope that we are going down um
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I find very
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
objectionable in the cacr is the actual
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
number of 20 four weeks now I'm married
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
to a doctor doesn't mean I am one or
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
understand anything about being a doctor
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
but what I do know is how hard he
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
studies to stay up todate on current
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
medical practice and he refers medical
 
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine to Fat tie
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
skinny tie syndrome meaning this year
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
the fat tie is in fashion and next year
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
the skinny tie will be in fashion so we
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
keep all the ties in our our closet
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
because we don't know which year we're
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
going to wear the fat one or the skinny
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
one so I find it very very dangerous
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
that we're going to put an actual limit
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
to abortion in the Constitution I what
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
happens when we find out that the age of
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
viability is 15 weeks what if we can
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
someday keep babies alive out of their
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
mother's womb at 15 weeks we don't know
 
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
what medicine is going to do and we
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
don't know what decisions doctors are
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
going to make based on this
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
cacr and if
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
anything being married to a doctor I
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
know just enough about medicine that I'm
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
always very skeptical about which
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
doctors you choose to
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
trust and finally on a personal
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
note I am the product of an adoption two
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
people chose to have sex and I'm the
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
consequence of their action
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
I'm alive and here to tell you about
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
it I know my birth mother we talk
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
regularly it's an amazing thing she
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
feels intense guilt about the fact that
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
she gave me up for adoption but you know
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
what I can talk about it with her and at
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
least she doesn't have to live with the
 
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
guilt of knowing that I'm not here and
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
she can't reach out to me what to talk
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
about it I also happen to be a woman who
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
was in a situation with an unwanted
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and I walked through that
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
college campus every single day up until
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
the moment that I gave birth and gave my
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
own daughter up for adoption and the lie
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
that women are being told that they
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
can't do that that they're not strong
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
enough that they will not graduate from
 
00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:50.839 align:start position:0%
college they will not have a career and
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
heaven forbid you might not be a State
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
Rep someday that's a lie and I'm proof
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the fact that the LIE is a lie thank
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions for this
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman thank you I
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
apologize it is Susan Vandy Castile from
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
District 25 I'm a registered Republican
 
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
and please excuse me I wasn't really
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak today but I
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
sponsored this change because I don't
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
believe this change should even be
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
discussed I was appalled when it went
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
into effect in
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
2020 um I just not factual give it you
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
in my opinion why a um Republican is
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
standing up for these rights for the
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
women in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
because I'm a citizen of the United
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
States I live in New Hampshire the Live
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
Free or Die
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
State I value everyone's opinion which
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
everyone here and I got to tell you it's
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
a very personal personal decision when
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
you're in that situation I was a um
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
geriatric pregnancy and I had a choice
 
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
in late term if I was termin or keep
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
it's very personal no woman wants to
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
stand there and defend themselves in
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
front of you their colleagues every
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
resident in the state so I believe we
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
have more to change in the state of New
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make it great than talk
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
about personal very personal
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
decisions I do not know of any woman
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
that has had an abortion after 25 weeks
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
everyone that I have asked they cannot
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
tell me if they know anyone
 
00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
however I would never judge that person
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
God is the only one and God We Trust
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
will judge that person so I think we
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
should send this bill this change to the
 
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
voters of the State of New Hampshire and
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
let them speak no change should be made
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
it if I had my way I'd remove it
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
strictly right from the constitution of
 
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so please thank you very
 
00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:22.839 align:start position:0%
much for allowing me to speak I wasn't
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
prepared but it kind of upsets me that
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
we're standing here discussing these
 
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
personal matters instead of State
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
matters for elected officials not
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
politicians thank you thank you
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh next I'm going to call on uh
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
Lum good morning
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Dick llum I am a life
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
director for the dairy Nights of
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
Columbus I am here to oppose
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
c23 relating to the right for an
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
abortion what's going on here
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
Representatives even though abortions in
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
our loud before 24 weeks
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
ci23 will will allow abortions to be
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
performed after 24 weeks if deem
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
necessary by a doctor excuse me but I
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if this board is aware that
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
abortions are now being performed by
 
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
doctors at plan Parenthood AB
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
braries like at P Parenthood on Penacook
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
Street in Manchester in other locations
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
even right here on Main Street in konet
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
so I guess an abortion would be an easy
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
enough just walk into one of those life
 
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
centers life centers for The Unborn and
 
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
request an abortion for whatever reason
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
anyway I support life from the moment of
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
conception and like a life God I stress
 
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.039 align:start position:0%
the word life I and other people of like
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
mind will always TR out a life
 
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%

00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
alternatives to fut and give them
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
Alternatives which plann Parenthood
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't do Alternatives like birri real
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%

Hampshire that support mothers and their
 
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
unborn and by the way don't charge for
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
their services ever ever abies like
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
plant parent and other killer clinics
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
don't give anything but just take and
 
00:58:02.029 --> 00:58:02.039 align:start position:0%
only take making tidy profit while doing
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
this so-called medical
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
procedure and that is the atrocity of
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
abortion thank God our mothers decided

Judiciary Committee my name is Dr Amy
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
Lee I'm a New Hampshire resident and a
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
practicing OBGYN resident physician as a
 
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
resident physician I have completed my
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
medical degree and I'm now in the
 
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
process of
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
specialization called
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
residency after four years of residency
 
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
I will be an independent
 
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
provider I'm here today to express my
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
support for cacr
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
23 when applying to residency programs I
 
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
like countless other medical graduates
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
was looking for the assurance that I
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
would get training in abortion care
 
00:59:35.359 --> 00:59:36.630 align:start position:0%
would get training in abortion care
during

00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
during
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
residency I will be transparent in
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
saying that the lack of protection to
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
abortion access in New Hampshire law
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
gave me serious pause when considering
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
coming to the state for
 
00:59:52.109 --> 00:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
training let me be very
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
clear the training of residents in New
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a powerful recruitment tool
 
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
nationally 57% more than half of
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
residents will ultimately practice in
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
the state where they did their
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
residency in New Hampshire for the past
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
5 years we have had a 65% retention rate
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
and we do not want that excellent
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
retention to
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
change we know that states with
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
restrictive abortion bans or limited
 
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
access to reproductive Health Care have
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
seen a drop in the number of OBGYN
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
residency applications
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
those states are losing a valuable pool
 
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
of future providers during a time where
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
the healthcare Workforce is plagued by a
 
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.670 align:start position:0%
the healthcare Workforce is plagued by a
shortage

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
nationally when 50 when
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
43.9% of current OBGYN residents lack
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
access to abortion care training New
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a state that provides that
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for training attracts
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
residents and in turn future providers
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
for our patients and your constituents
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
the protections afforded by cacr 23
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
should the New Hampshire voters get the
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in on this crucial
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
reproductive healthcare issue would draw
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
future providers for residency and
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
encourage them to establish roots in New
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we want those New Hampshire
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
trained doctors to have all the tools
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
they need to provide evidencebased care
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
for your constituents and that includes
 
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.430 align:start position:0%
for your constituents and that includes
abortion

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.069 align:start position:0%

used to do back then and finally ended
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%

Base in northern Maine when he got there
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
they asked him they said would you like
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
to be our obstetrician or or
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
pediatrician he candidly said you know I

really like screaming women more than I
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
like screaming
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
kids so they made him their obstetrician
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
and it was there he fell in love with
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
taking care of women and delivering
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
their babies and it was because of that
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
experience he went on for four years of
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
training as an OBGYN specialist at
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
Women's Hospital in New York
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
City and it was during that time in the
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
late 1950s he saw many young women die
 
01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
die of an overwhelming
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
infection having had an illegal botched
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
back alley
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
abortion and some of those women left
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
children at home as
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
orphans it came to
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
him that abortions must be safe and
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
legal he argued that women will always
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
always seek desperately seek abortion
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
care whether it's legal or
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
illegal the unnecessary deaths he
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
witnessed during his training left a
 
01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
mark on his heart his mind and his
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
soul it was plain to him that abortion
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
should only be performed by skilled
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
conditions US Supreme Court roie Wade
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
landmark decision in
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
1973 brought great relief to him besides
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
delivering thousands of babies days and
 
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
nights he provided abortion care in our
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
office at conquered hospital and at the
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
feminist Health Center now called
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
equality Health
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
Center motivated by what he'd
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
experienced during his training he
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
stayed intent on making
 
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
abortion safe and
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
private I often asked him I said how can
 
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
you vote for a republican candidate
 
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
who's openly opposed to
 
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
abortion his answer was always the
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
same he said o abortion is not about
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
politics it's about health care it's
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
Women and few knew better than him his
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
feelings never
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
wavered even though he was threatened by
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
protesters at our office and at his
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
home he would be appalled that politics
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
has crept into the judicial
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
branch of our
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
democracy and that with the do's
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
decision we reversed roie Wade in June
 
01:07:51.079 --> 01:07:52.910 align:start position:0%
decision we reversed roie Wade in June
of

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.150 align:start position:0%
of
2022

01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
he would find it hard to believe that
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
after 50 years the right to privacy and
 
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
safety and deciding about a woman's
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
health her family and her future has
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
been taken away from
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
her he knew that the decision to
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
terminate a
 
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
pregnancy was a difficult decision
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
deeply private and should remain between
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
a woman and her
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:24.590 align:start position:0%
a woman and her
caregiver

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
caregiver
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
that medicine is about
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
caring for human beings it's not about
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
politics it's not about
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
ideology he believed that everything we
 
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.149 align:start position:0%
ideology he believed that everything we
can

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:39.159 align:start position:0%

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%

01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
bodies enhances their health and their
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%

01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you to please limit
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
your comments to 3 minutes yes thank you
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee I know
 
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
that you guys do this year in and year
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
out and you've heard every argument that
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
can be made on this topic and so uh I
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
would just like to spend my few minutes
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
just calling to uh memory um a couple of
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
important points that I haven't heard
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
brought up by committee members in
 
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
conversation as to the part that uh
 
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
deals with after 24 weeks which we refer
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
to as the fetal Life protection act here
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
at the state house um we have mentioned
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
that there's an exception for um fetal
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
anomalies incompatible with life uh and
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
that there is one for the life of the
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
mother but we have not g into the fact
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
that it goes beyond the life of the
 
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
mother and into the health of the mother
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
um the statute
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
um I just had it
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
sorry um the pregnancy will have created
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
a serious risk of substantial and
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
irreversible impairment of a m major
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
bodily function as defined in the rsas
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
so any that puts a major bodily function
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
of a female at risk who's pregnant and
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
having a child is also o grounds for an
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
abortion after the 24 we Mark in the
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire it's not just the
 
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
life of the mother if there looks like
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a serious
 
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
complication to something it's also
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
grounds um so just by way of reminder
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
there the second is just the nature of
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
the debate um and for people on my side
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
of this issue uh and I know you know my
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
wife sent me with her blessing this
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
morning it's difficult as a man
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes speaking on this topic but my
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
wife and every woman in my household
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
that I uh agrees with with me on this
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
we recognize that pregnancy bringing a
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
new human being into the world is a is a
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
terribly difficult task it's dangerous
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of complications and
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
worries and fears and potentials we
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
can't see the future we don't know
 
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
what's coming and uh and in some in some
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
cases in the future when we look back we
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
wish we'd made different decisions than
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
the ones that we had made but in the
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
moment I understand all of the dangers
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
and complications and my sympathy is
 
01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.830 align:start position:0%
and complications and my sympathy is
there

01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
100% if it was simply a matter of making
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
decisions based on the healthcare
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
choices between a a woman and her
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
physician I'd be out in fact you could I
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know me I'm one of the most pro-life
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
people in this house um you could
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
convince me to switch sides it is
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
possible all you have to do is convince
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
me that in order to solve our problems
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
we're not killing innocent
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
children just just make that argument
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
convince me on that point I'll switch
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
sides that's what we're concerned about
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
and that's why the legislature is
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
involved the legislature is involved is
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
because half of us make the argument
 
01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
that we're killing innocent children in
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
order to solve our problems to solve our
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
worries and our fears and our
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
complications and the ways in which we
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
might our life might go poorly in the
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
future and Mr chair members of the
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee I would submit to you today
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's just not an acceptable
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
option and if we started imp
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
implementing those same kinds of
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
standards to people after they were born
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
I think we'd be mortified with what we
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
were doing and I see no difference
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
between the two thank you for your time
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for the this
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you of the
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%

01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
please good morning honorable members of
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
the House Judiciary Committee for the
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
record my name is Liz Canada I'm the
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
advocacy director at Planned Parenthood
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire action fund and Planned
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
Parenthood of Northern New England and
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
we're here in strong support of cacr
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
23 after the US Supreme Court overturned
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
roie Wade in June of
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
2022 abortion has been on the ballot
 
01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
very explicitly in Six States Kansas
 
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Vermont California Michigan and
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
just two months ago Ohio now two of
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
those measures were to further restrict
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
strict abortion in their states but the
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
other four were to enshrine protections
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
into their state
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
constitution now those states have very
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
different processes in order to amend
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
their constitutions some allow
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
signatures to be collected and ballot
 
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
initiatives we don't have that in New
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but the question was still the
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
same and in all four of those states
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
which are arguably very different from
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
one another voters overwhelmingly
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
supported abortion rights approving free
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
from the government in personal
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
decision- making now here in New
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've enjoyed for so long a
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support of Reproductive
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
Rights here in the State House abortion
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
rights are supported by a vast majority
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
of granite Staters from all political
 
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
backgrounds Granite Staters want their
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
lawmakers they want you to take the
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
steps needed to protect abortion rights
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Constitution which
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
means passing the
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
cacr in fact a recent poll in in New
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire showed that
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
64% of Republicans say there should be a
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
right to get an abortion in every state
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
cacr 23 would send this question to the
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
voters it would allow the voters of New
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to decide on whether our state
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
constitution should be amended to
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
explicitly include abortion and to stop
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
any further abortion bans from the New
 
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.470 align:start position:0%
any further abortion bans from the New
Hampshire

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
legislature this cacr embodies Granite
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
State values of freedom and privacy and
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
it shows that we trust
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
doctors I know it is a high bar to amend
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution it should
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
be to amend the state constitution but
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
we know that a vast majority of graned
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
Staters agree with this and that they
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
want that right enshrined in there to
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
protect it for future
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
Generations so we encourage you to vote
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
aop pass on cacr 23 thank you thank you
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative kab
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question I wanted to ask you a
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
similar question as I've asked
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
others would you be supportive of an
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to this that allowed abortion
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
through 24 weeks and then beyond for
 
01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
reasons of life of the mother or fatal
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly but protected the life of
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
the baby the that's viable and healthy
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative so I don't want to speak
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
on any amendment I haven't seen so I
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
can't say one way or the other on that
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
what I will say is that we are seeing
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
across the country how exceptions that
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
are written out in that way don't
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily work on the ground an
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
example that is very recent and you may
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
have heard of this example already is
 
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
Kate Cox in Texas there is an exception
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
in the incredibly restrictive abortion
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
ban in Texas that
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
she that she fell under that she was
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
able to access abortion under that
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
exception based on the way that the
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
exception was written out but when she
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
challenged what the courts were saying
 
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
the courts denied her that care they
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
were not trusting doctors and so she had
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
to leave her State because of how the
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
exception was being
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
interpreted the way that this cacr is
 
01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
written removes that it says we trust
 
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
doctors and patients to make this
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
private medical decision and so we
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
support cacr 23 thank you other
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
questions for This
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
Ss seeing none thank you very much well
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative Perez I'm
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
didn't see you thank
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
you last year when we were discussing
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
abortion I specifically asked a um
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative from Planned Parenthood
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
at up to what gestation they allowed
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
abortions and it was 15 weeks that has
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
gone up in the state of New Hampshire I
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
just spoke to the dairy Clinic yesterday
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
and they allow it up to 21
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
weeks call them up to 21 weeks in clinic
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
in clinic um I just wonder I'm going to
 
01:18:06.679 --> 01:18:07.950 align:start position:0%
in clinic um I just wonder I'm going to
ask

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.629 align:start position:0%
ask
again

01:18:09.629 --> 01:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
why since you represent these groups why
 
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
are we talking about a 24 we
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional and this is New Hampshire
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we're not talking
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
about Tex Tas we're not talking about
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
Michigan we're talking about New
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire why the 24 weeks nobody seems
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to answer
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
representative so to be clear um the
 
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
gational limits that we're talking about
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
at the Planned Parenthood Northern New
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
England Health Centers uh Manchester is
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
to 18 weeks Derry just recently um
 
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
started being able to offer abortion
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
care up to 11 weeks through medication
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
abortion you'll hear more about all of
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
those in a later bill actually so we we
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
can hold on that till later because I
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
know my colleague is here to address
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
that very thing later today why 24 weeks
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
what this uh cacr does is embodies what
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
you're saying representative it's not a
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
Texas cacr it's not a constitutional
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be for another
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
state it is for us here of what we've
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
had these debates and discussions on
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
over the past few years and really
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
embodies what granted Staters want they
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
want the right to abortion explicitly
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
listed in the state constitution so
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
there is no confusion
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
and they want to trust doctors in the
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
state constitution so that a further
 
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
legis a future legislature can't roll
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
back those restrictions any further like
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
we're seeing later today in those
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
bills other question yes representative
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
manage thank you Mr chair Miss Canada
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
another witness testified that it's too
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
soon for a constitutional amendment I'm
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if you disagree with that and
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
if so why thank you representative for
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
that question I do disagree that it is
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
too soon I think we need it now more
 
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
than ever with roie Wade gone there are
 
01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
no federal or state protections for
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire we're the only
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
state in New England that doesn't have
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
any protections Granite Staters expect
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
their lawmakers to take action another
 
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
poll shows that 87% of granite Staters
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
want action taken by lawmakers and
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
support reproductive freedom and so this
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
is the time to do it this is the time to
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrate our commit ment to Granite
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
Staters and what they are asking
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
lawmakers to
 
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
do other other questions yes
 
01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.310 align:start position:0%
do other other questions yes
representative

01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
ter yeah thank you for taking my
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
question um do you see um in terms of a
 
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment versus the law
 
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
that is existing today that they come
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
from different uh sides of the same
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
argument the Constitutional Amendment
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
essentially being the people turned out
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
to the voters prohibiting us the
 
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
lawmakers from passing laws within a
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
certain parameter that restrict their
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
freedoms and Liberties versus a law
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
which in this case tends to come on the
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
other side and per permit those
 
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions and Define them and is that
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
a framework within which you can view
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
the need for a constitutional me thank
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
you for the question yes I mean the cacr
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
and sending it to the voters is hearing
 
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
directly from them on this matter and
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
putting this question forward so that
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
you know we see how abortion is on the
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
ballot in elections in general but this
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
would be very explicit do you think that
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
the right to abortion should be in the
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution so that a future
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
legislature can't roll back restrictions
 
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
anymore or in you know add more
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions in the future I think it is
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
incredibly imperative that a question is
 
01:21:47.629 --> 01:21:47.639 align:start position:0%
sent to the voters like
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
that other yes uh representative
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:57.830 align:start position:0%
that other yes uh representative
testerman

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
this C this question came up earlier and
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we we got an answer to
 
01:22:07.229 --> 01:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
it uh it says right up early that the
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
every individual has a fundamental right
 
01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.510 align:start position:0%
every individual has a fundamental right
to

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
abortion uh doesn't say women doesn't
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
say men doesn't say whatever trans
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
whatever is this an attempt to get sort
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
of an artificial
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
way of you putting that decision or that
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
thought into the minds of people uh as
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
part of this abortion
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
bill I couldn't hear the last part of
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
your question but I heard the I think I
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
heard the concept of it which is using
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
the word individual instead of men or
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
women or trans men or whatever you you
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
know at the list that you gave um every
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
individual individuals are Granite
 
01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
Staters whether you're pregnant now or
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
pregnant in the future you should have
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
the right to abortion so I think that is
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
very clearly spelled out that if
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
somebody walks into The Ballot Box on
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
Election Day they'll see this language
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
know exactly what it covers which is an
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
individual's own right to their own
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy that it trusts doctors
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
and they would vote in
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
support thank
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
you other questions yes representative
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
hon so I have a question about the
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
legislative history of this um I guess
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
guess I'll make uh two questions first
 
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
of all isn't isn't this 24 weeks
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
something that was fairly recently put
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
in the statute law and actually um I'm
 
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
not personally 100% sure whether 24 is
 
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
the appropriate number but there was
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
this what isn't this something that was
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
just very recently put into the statute
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
law with I think extremely broad
 
01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.390 align:start position:0%
law with I think extremely broad
bipartisan

01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
support thank you for the question so if
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding it's you're asking is
 
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
the 24-week conversation essentially
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
very new to New Hampshire and yes it was
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
passed in 2020 21 um there were two
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
bills that were introduced in 2021 in
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
the house Judiciary one was a 24-week
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
ban and it passed through the house and
 
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
it was uh debated in the Senate and then
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
put into the state budget it it went
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
into effect on January 1st 20122 and
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
then in the 2022 legislature some parts
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
of it were rolled back so it removed the
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
mandatory ultrasounds and it added fatal
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
fetal diagnoses which you know we've
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
heard already here too so yes it is very
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
very recent this entire debate prior to
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
that um prior to 2021 New Hampshire
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
trusted doctors and patients and so the
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
cacr would return us to that
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
point other questions oh followup to
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
this and isn't yes representative gon
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
we're going I'm sorry follow
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
sores and with the other issue about
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're equaling about the mean the word
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
individual but isn't
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
really going far back behind 2021
 
01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:51.639 align:start position:0%
basically probably since New Hampshire
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
the state EV state law always
 
01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.830 align:start position:0%
the state EV state law always
represented

01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:24:57.629 --> 01:24:57.639 align:start position:0%
that the person who the person who
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
actually is pregnant has a much
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
different uh much higher stake in the
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy than somebody who's you know
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
merely a family member even you know the
 
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
father or whoever so isn't hasn't there
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
always been a long-standing presumption
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
of the law that the person who's
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
actually pregnant um is much more has
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
like a much uh deeper uh relationship
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
with the issue than just somebody else
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
who's another uh family member associate
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
of the person
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes I think it
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
all comes down to the person who's
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
pregnant their own individual body yes
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony in the bill
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill it says the
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
state cannot prohibit restrict delay or
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
penalize this right prior to 24 weeks
 
01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
unless it is justified by a compelling
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
State interest achieved by the least
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
restrictive means what is the definition
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
of a compelling State interest and can
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
you give me an example of one thank you
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
for the question my understanding is
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
that would be determined by the court if
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
that were something that would to go
 
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
forward so I would defer to attorneys
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not an attorney but that's my
 
01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
understanding other questions for this
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
witness saying none thank you very much
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next I'm going to call on
 
01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:19.960 align:start position:0%

sorry his read okay yes

01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
you please uh try to keep your testimony
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%

01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:55.189 align:start position:0%
 
papers

01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee my
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
name is Courtney Reid I serve as policy
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
Advocate with the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm providing a statement of support
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
for cacr 23 which would enshrine the
 
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
right to abortion in New Hampshire state
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
constitution cacr 23 would give voters
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to affirm that in the
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
granite state the right to personal
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
reproductive autonomy should not be
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
denied this is one of the most effective
 
01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
things that New Hampshire can do to
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
protect the reproductive rights of
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state and it's more
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
critical now than ever as I'm sure many
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
of you are aware uh to protect these
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
rights in state law or in the state
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
constitution after the Dos decision in
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
recent years nationally we've seen the
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights landscape fall into
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
chaos where 60 plus clinics have closed
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
over 20 states have restricted or banned
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
abortion and now one in five women are
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
traveling out of state to receive
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
abortion care however there are states
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
that have taken affirmative actions to
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
protect the right to abortion either
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
through state law or through
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendments like cacr 23
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
in states that have brought
 
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections to the voters
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
like California Michigan Ohio and our
 
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
neighboring state of
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
Vermont constituents have had
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support to put this right
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution and without any federal
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
protections to abortion these
 
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights at the state level
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
are more important than ever because
 
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
right now we're just one election away
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
or one bill away from making access to
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire all the more
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
difficult when someone finds thems
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
unable to access an abortion uh they
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
might have uh increased difficulty
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
escaping poverty or they might have to
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
to put their education on hold they
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
might have to change their life plans or
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
they might have uh increased difficulty
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
leaving an abusive partner there's
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
research that also shows uh for
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
individuals that have not uh had access
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
to an abortion four years down the line
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh the prevalence of poverty is
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
increased this is called the turnaway
 
01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
study I referenced it in my
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
citations I want to underscore my
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
support and the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
support for this amendment as
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
reproductive of freedom is essential to
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
fulfilling the promise of equality and
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
self-determination and the granite
 
01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.470 align:start position:0%
self-determination and the granite
States

01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
States
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
principles of the right to privacy and
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
individual liberty I also wanted to
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
speak a bit to the uh least restrictive
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
means uh language that's in the
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
cacr um the least restrictive language
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
provides uh what would be a strict
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
scrutiny test for the right to an
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
abortion um as folks might be aware no
 
01:29:58.270 --> 01:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
right is 100% guaranteed sometimes
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
rights compete with one another um but
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
this language prioritizes the right to
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
an abortion when it is challenged for
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
say the right um to the parent so this
 
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
extra language gives the right to an
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
abortion an additional protection when
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
it is perhaps challenged in the courts
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why uh the ACLU is uh in
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
support of it so I'm happy to take any
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions for this
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
Perez how does the
 
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
life I thank you for your question I
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that that is something that
 
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
falls in the scope of the work that the
 
01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.830 align:start position:0%
falls in the scope of the work that the
ACLU

01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
ACLU
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
does follow up
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
well in the definition of the ACLU they
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
say they are their purpose is to defend
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
and preserve the individual rights and
 
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
Liberties guaranteed to every person in
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
this country by the Constitution and
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
laws of the United States I'm just
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
wondering what their definition is when
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
person thank you for your question um I
 
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
I think would be best for me to get back
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
to you and working with an attorney on
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
that but I do want to note that the ACLU
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
has always supported the prevailing
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
right of the pregnant individual to have
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
the autonomy to make reproductive
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
decisions thank you other questions for
 
01:31:38.119 --> 01:31:38.990 align:start position:0%
decisions thank you other questions for
this

01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%

01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
bunch of attorneys maybe you would know

01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
answer you say in your testim Tony here
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
after the Supreme Court overturned Row
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
versus Wade we no longer have a federal
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to an
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
abortion when was the Constitution
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
amended to allow for or to to give the
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
right for an abortion when was the
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution amended again to take away
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
that right and are you conflating are
 
01:32:17.709 --> 01:32:17.719 align:start position:0%
these attorneys conflating Row versus
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
Wade which is a Judicial precedent with
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
a constitutional right so a little
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
disingenuous language here just want to
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%

1970s when roie

Wade was ruled the courts interpreted
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
that the right to privacy was a
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
constitutional right um the do's
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
decision overturned that that ruling and
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
the courts had stated that it's up to
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
states to take independent actions to
 
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
protect the right to abortion as
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
interpreted um which is why this
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%

01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
amendments to the Constitution should
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
seek Justice for the benefit of the

common good should unite us as free
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
people not divide us the weaponization
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Constitution as
 
01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
outlined in

charity and human dignity for the common
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
good a common purpose for the

Constitution to serve its purpose it
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
must act as a coherent unified working
 
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
document any amendment should Echo and
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
support its purposes an amendment cannot
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
survive if it disrupts or conflicts with
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
other other Provisions
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
ca23 represents challenges as an
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Amendment
 
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment must be harmonious with
 
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
the body of the
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution it cannot be internally
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
inconsistent if it is then such
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
amendment should be declared
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in the do's decision
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
the court noted that the constitution
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
makes no reference to abortion no such
 
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
right is implicitly protected by the
 
01:34:47.229 --> 01:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution or any constitutional
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
provision an abortion in and of itself
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
is contct to the spirit and intent of
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
the Constitution the court recognized
 
01:34:58.270 --> 01:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
that there are rights that are not
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly mentioned which can Garner
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional support provided those
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
rights are deeply rooted in this
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
nation's history and implicit in the
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
concept of ordered Liberty the New
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution makes that
 
01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear in part one article two
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
of our constitution all men have certain
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent rights
 
01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
the drafters of our constitution
 
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
understood that there were certain
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
rights not all rights that are worthy of
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional protection abortion is
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
not a right contemplated by the
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution nor is it a right
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
contemplated by the 14th Amendment it is
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
not deeply rooted in our nation's
 
01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
history or is it implicit in the concept
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
of ordered Liberty it is critically
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
different from any other right that the
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court held worthy of
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional Liberty protection when
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
the 14th amendment was adopted three4 of
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%

creating dissension Discord and
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%

01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
basis for the institution of this
 
01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
amendment or how it is Central to

believes that abortion is a right

contemplated by the Constitution a look
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%

article three provides when one enters
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
into a state of society they surrender
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
up some of their natural rights in order
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
to ensure the protection of others the
 
01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
others can in and clearly should be
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
viewed as the children in our
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
society to include those children living
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
in their mother's
 
01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
wom further as already has been stated
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
the language of cacr 23 is extremely
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
problematic the amendment's language
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
proposes that the state cannot prohibit
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
abortion prior to 24 weeks unless it is
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
justified by compelling State interests
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
achieved by list by the least
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
restrictive means attempting to apply a
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny standard assumes without
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
justification that abortion is a
 
01:37:48.750 --> 01:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental right the New Hampshire
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution clearly states that there
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
there are certain unalienable rights
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
further the fundamental rights that
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
demand strict scrutiny has been
 
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
identified and they include such rights
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
as freedom of speech voting laws that
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on the race not the
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
aborting of our children you know ma'am
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
could I just ask you I've sort of
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
requested people to try to keep it to
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
three minutes and I think you're
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
considerably over that now I'd
 
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you could sort of sum
 
01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
up thank you uh New Hampshire has
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
recognized the rights of parents to care
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
for their
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
as a fundamental liberty interest
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
protected by article
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
one by part one Article 2 of the New
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution it's impossible
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
to reconcile the wellestablished

categorize or set perimeters for where
 
01:38:58.109 --> 01:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
it is necessary or what the applicable
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
standard of care would be to allow

01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair hi my name is Jason
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hennessy I'm here to represent New
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right to life uh New
 
01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's largest single issue prolife
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
organization and as well as the many
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
many many pro-life uh New Hampshire
 
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
residents so we are we are completely
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to the cacr 23 the biggest thing
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
the first thing to mention is that this
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
would legalize abortion through
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
birth and that is that is a very big
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
deal that is out of touch with 90% of
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
Americans according to a Harvard Harris
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
poll from 2022 as well as 70% of New
 
01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.470 align:start position:0%
poll from 2022 as well as 70% of New
Hampshire

01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:37.719 align:start position:0%
residents now if you don't doubt that
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
this is abortion till birth you just
 
01:41:43.629 --> 01:41:43.639 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at um at the bill
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
the bill says that abortion after 24
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
weeks is allowed with a physician's
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
opinion if you if you were to attend the
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh the hearing for a very similar Bill
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
cacr 24 last week in the Senate you
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
would have heard Physicians from New
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saying that abortion is always
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay that in their opinion it's always
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
an option so and it and so if you
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
believe that elective abortions don't
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
happen after that after that stage in
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
the third trimester just need to look at
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
the statistics from other states um even
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
though there aren't very many of these
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
third trimester abortions there are
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
there are statistics that say that
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
roughly half of them uh give or take are
 
01:42:27.149 --> 01:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
what we would call electives so not for
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
the health or for rape or incest or
 
01:42:31.589 --> 01:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
those types of things there are also
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
clinics across the country that uh
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
advertise that they will do8 n eight and
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
N month
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
abortions uh for whatever reason you
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
want so this bill is
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
Extreme the the state has a duty to
 
01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:48.510 align:start position:0%
Extreme the the state has a duty to
defend

01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
defend
 
01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
life and and make no mistake these are
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
especially especially in the third
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
trimester these are healthy babies these
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
are babies that could be born these are
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh babies that could be that feel pain
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
that could be given up for at a because
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
of our safe haven law nobody's required
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
to raise a child under a safe haven law
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we've had for over 20
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
years now you can take you can drop a
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
child off at a hospital for any reason
 
01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
no questions asked and that's on top of
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
of adoption I want to mention the story
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
of Brooke Fisk Brook was 17 weeks
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
pregnant with her son macki she visited
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
her uh the child's father to say will
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
you help me raise this child in return
 
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
he put He put chemical abortion drugs
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
into her tea and she drank it and then
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
lost her
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
child this this Constitutional Amendment
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
as the chair pointed out gives
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
individuals the right to abort it
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't say who whose child they can
 
01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:50.679 align:start position:0%
abort would this legalize the
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
victimization and oppression of women
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
that is a question that needs to be
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
answered there was another victim in
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin and and she and she lost
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
several pregnancies before finally
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
catching her V her her oppressor and
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
then now thankfully he's in
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
jail but she had several
 
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
miscarriages how many people you know
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
how many times how many people would
 
01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
take a look at this law say oh I have
 
01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
some protection if I get arrested for
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
this most people probably wouldn't get
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
caught so this this bill offers nothing
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
to support women who want their
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
child and it oppresses controls and
 
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
victimizes pregnant
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
women thank you very much sir you're
 
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:38.840 align:start position:0%

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:28.790 align:start position:0%
story I'm thankful every day for my two
wonderful

01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
children my pregnancies were relatively
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
uneventful which I am so incredibly
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
grateful for my deliveries on the other
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
hand were a very different story while
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
both were difficult my last delivery was
 
01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:43.589 align:start position:0%
both were difficult my last delivery was
especially

01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
harrowing I won't go into specifics uh
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
because much of it I'm still working uh
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
through today with the help of my
 
01:45:50.199 --> 01:45:51.709 align:start position:0%
through today with the help of my
therapy

01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
01:45:55.470 --> 01:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
IST however the crucial point is that
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
during that labor there was a very real
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
moment when I didn't believe either I or
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
my child would be walking out of that
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
hospital I've always been pro- Choice
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
even before delivering my son but it was
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
this experience that taught me two
 
01:46:11.639 --> 01:46:13.629 align:start position:0%
this experience that taught me two
inalienable

01:46:13.629 --> 01:46:13.639 align:start position:0%
inalienable
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
truths the first is that we are so
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have fantastic healthcare
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
providers that live in New Hampshire
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
our providers use their knowledge and
 
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:25.639 align:start position:0%
experience to provide invaluable care to
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
the people across our state it is
 
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
providers like the ones who have
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
testified before you that saved my life
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
and my son's life that
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
day they're the reason that I'm here and
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
able to testify and I will forever be
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
grateful the second truth is that
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
decisions about my body are rightfully
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
mine alone as I am the only one who
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
truly knows what's at
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
stake during both of my pregnancies and
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
deliveries I was incredibly fortunate to
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
have the protection of
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
row its fall is one of the deciding
 
01:47:00.189 --> 01:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
factors in my decision not to become
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
pregnant again I see the current bills
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
legislators have proposed in the New
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house I hear the genuine fear
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
among the providers in our medical
 
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
community who have
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
testified the last thing that I would
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
want my provider to worry about is being
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
able to prove in a court of law that
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
their conduct was necessary to save my
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
life or whether my life was indeed ever
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
in danger to begin with I don't want my
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
life to come down to an uncertain legal
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
landscape when I have two children who
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
need their mom to come home to them at
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
day I know this must be an incredibly
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
challenging job you represent people
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%

behalf but I'm here today to ask that
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
you let me help help make this decision
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
that you let us the people of New
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire make this decision trust us to
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
make the right decision for ourselves
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%

01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%

Lind paintner I live in conquer I'm here
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
to support cacr 23 I'm convinced that we
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
need a con Constitutional Amendment
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
based on my professional work and on my
 
01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
personal experiences which I'll
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
summarize for you I'm a retired doctor
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
not an obstetrician I'm an internist
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
even before I was a doctor I was a
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
nurse in that role in particular but
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
also as an internist I counseled many
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant women who came for me about for
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
information about their pregnancies
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
about options and I included legal
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
abortion in my information that I shared
 
01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.270 align:start position:0%
abortion in my information that I shared
with

01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
them and these conversations taught me
 
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
so much about the multitude of
 
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances which led some of those
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
women to choose abortion we've heard
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
some of these stories today I heard
 
01:49:42.189 --> 01:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
about multiple con contraceptive
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
failures I heard about sexual coercion
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
inside and outside of
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
marriage I heard about the word worry of
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
another mouth to feed within the P
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
powerlessness of
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
poverty previous life-threatening
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
pregnancy complications as we've just so
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
eloquently heard and many many more
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
personal stories and these women were
 
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:06.669 align:start position:0%
personal stories and these women were
not

01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
selfish they needed health
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
care I'm also a mother of two precious
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
daughters and I'm a person who sadly
 
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
experienced a spontaneous
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
abortion that's the medical term for a
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
miscarriage when I was 16 weeks along in
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
my very first pregnancy my body went
 
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.270 align:start position:0%
my very first pregnancy my body went
into

01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
labor I began to deliver my farto
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
premature fetus my
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
son I was
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
bleeding my obstetrician performed an
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
office procedure a dilation in curage we
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
call it a DNC and that safely stopped my
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
bleeding that same DNC procedure is also
 
01:51:03.149 --> 01:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
used safely to terminate pregnancies in
 
01:51:03.159 --> 01:51:04.629 align:start position:0%
used safely to terminate pregnancies in
the

01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:07.719 align:start position:0%
office what would have happened to me if
 
01:51:10.589 --> 01:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
a 15-week abortion ban had been in place
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
at that time would she have acted in
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
time would she have been willing to
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
perform a potentially questionable
 
01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
procedure my doctors are not martyrs
 
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
if they're being facing being called a
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
felon losing their medical
 
01:51:28.069 --> 01:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
license they don't do
 
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
it they're not reassured in the moment
 
01:51:32.589 --> 01:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
when there's
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
urgency by a vaguely worded exception to
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
protect the life of the mother the idea
 
01:51:41.709 --> 01:51:41.719 align:start position:0%
that these exceptions that you write in
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
cover it all is simply not accurate in
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
world these doctors have families to
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
feed so what do they do they leave the
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
state they don't come here to train we
 
01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:56.350 align:start position:0%
state they don't come here to train we
lose

01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
lose
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians labor and delivery Suites
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
are closing throughout New
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for many
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
reasons or they stop performing health
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
care that women need women can die as a
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
result and right now today there are
 
01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
actual court cases in Texas and Idaho
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
over the issue of weather emergency
 
01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
abortions to save the life of the mother
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
can be required you know what man' I
 
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
again we're getting you're sort of over
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
your three minute you're over your 3
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
minute time I just ask you if you could
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
sum up if you would I will thank you
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of the reasons that a
 
01:52:36.069 --> 01:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment is important I
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
support those reasons in protecting life

abortion care and more specifically vote

Amendment concurrent resolution
 
01:54:06.069 --> 01:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
23 since the United States Supreme Court
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
overturned the long standing protections
 
01:54:12.069 --> 01:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
guaranteed by roie Wade millions of
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
Americans have faced restrictions on
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
their fundamental freedom to access safe

before them previously came to rely upon
 
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
following that decision in June of
 
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
2022 State houses all across the country
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
have moved to obstruct reproductive
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
Freedom including right here in New
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where Republicans recently
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
introduced a 15-day abortion ban
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
attempts like these are dangerous to the
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of the women of
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
our state and must Must Be Stopped
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
simply put freedom for women starts with
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
being able to make our own reproductive
 
01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
Health Care decisions to plan prevent
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
and space our own pregnancies the
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
ability to access comprehensive
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care including birth
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
control and abortion care is essential
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
to protecting the health and well-being
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
of all this constitutional Amendment
 
01:55:22.990 --> 01:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
would ensure all granite sters have the
 
01:55:25.709 --> 01:55:25.719 align:start position:0%
freedom to make their own personal
 
01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care decisions
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
without government
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
interference there have been repeat
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
there has been repeated evidence and
 
01:55:38.669 --> 01:55:38.679 align:start position:0%
public polling that show a vast majority
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
of granite Staters support reproductive
 
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
freedom and want State leaders to
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
protect their right to abortion care yet
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is currently the only
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
state in New England that does not
 
01:55:55.149 --> 01:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
protect abortion rights we must change
 
01:55:58.750 --> 01:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
that this is an opportunity to enshrine
 
01:56:01.550 --> 01:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
reproductive Freedom into our state
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
constitution and make New Hampshire a
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
place where we explicitly trust women
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
and their doctors to make their own
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
personal health care decisions not
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
politicians we cannot wait we must act
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
today to protect our fundamental freedom
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
and once again I urge each of you to put
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
the fundamental freedom of granite
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
Staters above politics and vote ought to
 
01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:32.079 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire and I am here to voice
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
support for
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
cacr I strongly believe that decisions
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
regarding abortion should be solely left
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
to a pregnant person and their physici
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
this personal medical decision should
 
01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
not be legislated it should be left to
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
individuals and
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
professionals legislators do not
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
understand all of the complications that
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
may occur during pregnancy and should
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
not be excuse me should not be
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
legislating it as a result until
 
01:57:38.189 --> 01:57:38.199 align:start position:0%
abortion is ingrained in our
 
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
constitution current and future pregnant
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
persons are at risk even those who may
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
never choose to have an
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
abortion because they may not be able to
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
find adequate obstetric care if these
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians choose to not practice in
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because of this issue I
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
think that is a really grave concern and
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
very realistic we may be seeing
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
that these unintended consequences could
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
be catastrophic for New Hampshire
 
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
citizens having given birth after a
 
01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:10.990 align:start position:0%
citizens having given birth after a
full-term

01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
full-term
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy I can't imagine learning that
 
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
my fetus wasn't viable at 25 or 26 weeks
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
and yet still having to carry that fetus
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
full term the emotional scarring would
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
be catastrophic in my
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
opinion being pregnant is extremely
 
01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
difficult even that I had a very easy
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and I'll tell you it was still
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
extremely emotional and extremely
 
01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:44.709 align:start position:0%
extremely emotional and extremely
physical

01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
physical
 
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
challenging I think these decisions
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
should be left to individuals and
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely needs to be in our
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
constitution thank you thank you man
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%

Pediatrics um let me just talk about my
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
my former teacher who was uh
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
gynecolog she taught us Gynecology and
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
obstetrics she was a nurse and a midwife
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
at the
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
time when she was telling us this story
 
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
that she was uh delivering babies down
 
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
the hall in the hospital and then down
 
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
the hall she was aiding and killing them
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
it was very emotional for her so she
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
stopped doing
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
that um I can't speak for being pregnant
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
or having an abortion but several
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
members of my family have had
 
02:00:44.830 --> 02:00:44.840 align:start position:0%

02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
can relate as a man to the trauma and
 
02:00:51.870 --> 02:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
the and the difficulty of unplanned
 
02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.470 align:start position:0%
the and the difficulty of unplanned
pregnancy

02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
02:00:57.310 --> 02:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
um these gentlemen have talked about and
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
people have talked about
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
viability of um and even when life
 
02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:04.589 align:start position:0%
viability of um and even when life
begins

02:01:04.589 --> 02:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
begins
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
um I have some things on the paper there
 
02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:08.420 align:start position:0%
um I have some things on the paper there
that

02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:08.430 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:11.669 align:start position:0%
that

02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
um bernon Nathan sin was a uh he passed
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
away he was a a gynecologist who
 
02:01:23.950 --> 02:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
performed over 75,000 abortions in his
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
lifetime he
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
um saw an ultrasound this was back in
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
the 80s of an abortion and this was
 
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
in the technology of 40 years ago where
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
the technology now if you look at a an
 
02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
ultrasound of a baby in the womb even
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
very very small and early development
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's very graphic that is a person there
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.510 align:start position:0%
it is a
baby

02:01:58.510 --> 02:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
um we this talk
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
about it's part of or it's a woman's
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
right to choose or control choice of her
 
02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
body the baby in her womb is totally
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
different from
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
her she had the baby has totally
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
different DNA than the mother especially
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
if it's boy it's totally
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
different fetus is just a name that we
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
Des um telling us how old the child is
 
02:02:32.669 --> 02:02:32.679 align:start position:0%
like toddler middle schooler teenager
 
02:02:32.679 --> 02:02:33.550 align:start position:0%
like toddler middle schooler teenager
and

02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
adult tell us how old the person
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
is and because we can't see with our
 
02:02:39.199 --> 02:02:40.750 align:start position:0%
is and because we can't see with our
Naked

02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
Naked
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
initially in the womb it's similar to
 
02:02:50.189 --> 02:02:50.199 align:start position:0%
and I have on the the paper
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
there with taking a picture of this
 
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
beautiful rainbow I saw it three times
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
coming up from Manchester three
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
different places beautiful rainbow
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
remember the old Polaroids or they still
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
have Polaroids you take a
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
picture the paper comes out you can't
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
see anything because it's
 
02:03:10.109 --> 02:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
not fully developed yet but it's there
 
02:03:12.109 --> 02:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
if I went up to you and I ripped it up
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
the picture you took of that
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
rainbow you'd you'd be very mad at me
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
for doing that because you took a
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
rainbow but it's not developed yet if
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
you give it time it will develop and
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see the
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
picture sir you're getting you're really
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
at the three minute point so I would
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you could just sum up what
 
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
you have to say Okay that Bernard naen I
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned after he performed those
 
02:03:43.629 --> 02:03:43.639 align:start position:0%
75,000 abortions he made that video of
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
an actual
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
abortion an ultrasound and he stopped
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
performing abortions after that the
 
02:03:54.350 --> 02:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
doctor who performed that
 
02:03:58.350 --> 02:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
abortion had performed about 10,000
 
02:04:01.709 --> 02:04:01.719 align:start position:0%
abortions previous to that he stopped
 
02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
performing abortions because he saw that
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
it was a life in there the lady who was
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
assisting that yeah I really need you to
 
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
sum up Sir okay um you're you're
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
considerably over your time now I'm just
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
done here abortion is not safe many
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
women die I encourage you as a society
 
02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
as legislators as
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
people Stop The
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
Killing all right questions for this
 
02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair I really have a
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
question um for you some of our
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
Witnesses have been very generous and
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
have submitted to US Written testimony
 
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
which we in fact all read do you think
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
you could suggest that if someone is
 
02:04:56.189 --> 02:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
going to submit written testimony that
 
02:04:58.990 --> 02:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
they don't then stand up and read it but
 
02:05:02.109 --> 02:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps just summarize it for us and for
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
the rest of the people in the room thank
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
you no I I I agree I think that I think

that is an excellent suggestion and I
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
would encourage future witnesses to
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
please please do that if you have
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%

23 I am a pediatric emergency medicine
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
physician my adult life has been
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated to saving children's lives but
 
02:05:56.830 --> 02:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
I could not save my own daughters I had
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
two abortions my story is of my love and
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
my heartbreak but the value is in my
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
body and my choices this was my first
 
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and very much wanted by my
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
husband and I we were shocked and
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
thrilled when our first scan at 12 weeks
 
02:06:15.149 --> 02:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
showed two babies however the ultrasound
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
showed I also had an a uterine anomaly
 
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
a potentially life-threatening condition
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
the Twins were in two different areas of
 
02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:23.910 align:start position:0%
the Twins were in two different areas of
my

02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
uterus more studies suggested I was safe
 
02:06:29.470 --> 02:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
and we would have our baby girls we
 
02:06:31.709 --> 02:06:31.719 align:start position:0%
chose names I marked the date on my
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
calendar when they would be 29 weeks and
 
02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
likely to survive at 16 weeks and 4 days
 
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant I woke up with pain that became
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
sharp and severe it hurt to breathe I
 
02:06:46.109 --> 02:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
was ultimately sent to a Boston hospital
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
my husband and I sat in a dark room
 
02:06:51.069 --> 02:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
where monitor show the ultrasound images
 
02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
turned on during happy scans turned off
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
during the sad ones they were off for
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
ours the news was worse than we could
 
02:07:02.589 --> 02:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
imagine the left side was a previously
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
unrecognized rudimentary horn and the
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
uterine wall had ruptured in two places
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
this fetus had no chance my womb was
 
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
literally broken on the right side the
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
baby had a congenital heart defect which
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
would require surgery and functioning
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
lungs to survive
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
if she could make it to viability in my
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
broken womb these findings changed
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
everything to save my life I needed
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
surgery and one of my daughters inside
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
needed to be removed in surgery they
 
02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
saved the unicorni uterus and the fetus
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
on the right was still there but it was
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
clear that allowing the pregnancy to
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
continue would put me at a huge risk for
 
02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
2 weeks I sat on the couch tried to heal
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
from surgery and I loved my baby as hard
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
as I could I
 
02:07:51.870 --> 02:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
grieved we went to Boston for the
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
appointment the day before the DNC the
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
abortion we were there for medical care
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
we were there to save my life we were
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
there because this was the most
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate decision for our family we
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
were there because we needed to be there
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
my abortions saved my life my abortions
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
allowed me to have more children my

ca23 2 years years ago I stood before
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lawmakers for the first
 
02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:52.920 align:start position:0%

HB 1609 to add a fatal fetal diagnosis
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
exception to our state's abortion ban I
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
spoke of being a mother of seven
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
children including my daughter Kayla who
 
02:10:06.750 --> 02:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
I lost 19 years ago due to a fatal fetal
 
02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
anomaly our abortion was at 22 weeks
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
heading in for our routine ultrasound at
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
21 weeks we were filled with joy and
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
excitement for the new addition to our
 
02:10:17.790 --> 02:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
family our 2 and 1/2-year-old was with
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
us that day and thrilled about becoming
 
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
a big sister we did not receive good
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
news on that day December 5th 2005 on
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
December 10th KLA was delivered
 
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
stillborn after our termination the day
 
02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
before as we held her in our arms for
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
several hours we said goodbye to the
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
little girl that we continue to love
 
02:10:37.149 --> 02:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
with all of our hearts and will for a
 
02:10:39.149 --> 02:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
lifetime Kayla was found to have a
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
deletion in her 15th chromosome that was
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
not detected until after our abortion
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
our amniocentesis results returned a
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
month after our termination when I would
 
02:10:50.589 --> 02:10:50.599 align:start position:0%
have been 6 weeks pregnant this timeline
 
02:10:52.109 --> 02:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
is the reason that I began to tell our
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
story in support of the Fatal fetal
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
anomaly Amendment added to the abortion
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
ban instituted two years ago it is clear
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
that in these incredible complex
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
situations decision should be left to a
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
pregnant person and their doctor I have
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
learned a great deal over the course of
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
the last two years I have heard other
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters abortion stories our
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
experiences are varied but every one of
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
us deserve the right to make our own
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
personal private healthcare decisions
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's why I am urging you to allow
 
02:11:20.109 --> 02:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
voters the opportunity to add the right
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
to abortion to our state
 
02:11:24.030 --> 02:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
constitution since roie Wade was
 
02:11:26.589 --> 02:11:26.599 align:start position:0%
overturned in summer of 22 our country's
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
reproductive healthc care landscape has
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
been in disarray one in three American
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
women have lost the right to abortion in
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
their home state while abortion remains
 
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
safe and legal in New Hampshire before
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
24 weeks we are the only state in New
 
02:11:39.390 --> 02:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
England without a proactive protection
 
02:11:41.709 --> 02:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
for abortion rights Granite Staters are
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
now susceptible to out of state attacks
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
on their Healthcare in New Hampshire we
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
won't don't let other states dict
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
dictate our rights that's not the 603
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
way I did not make the decision to have
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
an abortion with ease nor uninformed
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
though we had only hours to make our
 
02:11:57.390 --> 02:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
decision those hours were filled with
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
gathering information and asking many
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
questions in the days that followed I
 
02:12:02.830 --> 02:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
continued to look for answers and
 
02:12:04.350 --> 02:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
together with my Physicians we made the
 
02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
best decision for our family not once
 
02:12:08.310 --> 02:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
did I look to my state legislators for
 
02:12:10.549 --> 02:12:10.559 align:start position:0%
advice opinions or medical knowledge I
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
trusted in my Physicians expertise and
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
the information that we had Granite
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
Staters are capable of making thoughtful
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
decisions about their own Healthcare and
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
consultation with their loved ones faith
 
02:12:22.350 --> 02:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
and medical providers as they see fit
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's elected officials should
 
02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
not turn their backs on our state's
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
tradition of trusting Granite Staters to
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
make these decisions in the face of
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
national uncertainty you have the
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
ability to take proactive action to
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
ensure abortions remain safe and legal
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I urge you to support
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.040 --> 02:13:05.510 align:start position:0%

speaking in support of cacr 23 I'm also
 
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
speaking only for myself I merely want
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
to tell a quick story about my
 
02:13:26.990 --> 02:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
experience supporting a loved one
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
through their abortion we struggled at
 
02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
the time having grown up in a faith that
 
02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
taught me to believe abortion abortion
 
02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
was selfish and harmful I know now
 
02:13:37.549 --> 02:13:37.559 align:start position:0%
firmly that abortion is Healthcare and I
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
decided that I wanted to be as
 
02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
supportive as I could knowing that it
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
was her
 
02:13:44.430 --> 02:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
decision in 2003 my then pregnant
 
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
girlfriend told me her decision to have
 
02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
an abortion on the day the appointment I
 
02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:51.559 align:start position:0%
remember quietly moving through a large
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
group of protesters with rosaries as we
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
walked up the steps to the equality
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
Health Center together right down the
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
street once we made it through the front
 
02:14:01.390 --> 02:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
doors we immediately greeted and treated
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
with compassion and empathy the staff
 
02:14:06.430 --> 02:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
there welcomed us with kindness and
 
02:14:08.830 --> 02:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
without judgment with my partner's
 
02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
permission the staff allowed me to go
 
02:14:13.229 --> 02:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
upstairs and hold her hand during the
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
abortion my experience there felt like a
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
comforting Embrace with people who
 
02:14:18.549 --> 02:14:18.559 align:start position:0%
listened understood and took care of us
 
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
with respect and
 
02:14:22.589 --> 02:14:22.599 align:start position:0%
dignity I'll will never forget the
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
feeling and safety they created in that
 
02:14:24.639 --> 02:14:26.390 align:start position:0%
feeling and safety they created in that
room

02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately we broke up that year however
 
02:14:31.709 --> 02:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
we met for lunch 17 years later while
 
02:14:33.149 --> 02:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
the decision for her was a challenging
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
one at the time we agreed that it was
 
02:14:37.549 --> 02:14:37.559 align:start position:0%
the Draconian beliefs and cold talous
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
teachings we were brought up with that
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
made the experience of a medical
 
02:14:43.229 --> 02:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
decision a living hell I used to have
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
nightmares of that day we went through
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
with the abortion I think about the
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
protesters and the shame put upon us
 
02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
both in her decision now I dream of a
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
day where everyone can access the care

Hampshire house Judiciary Committee I
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
oppose cacr 23 because I believe no one
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
sh should have the right to deprive an
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
emerging human being of Life sanctity of
 
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
life is not only a religious belief but
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
a moral and ethical conv conviction for
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
Millions even billions of people
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
worldwide it can't be erased from Human
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
Consciousness but is an often
 
02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
rationalized way for the sake of
 
02:17:25.309 --> 02:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
expediency pro-choice I'm all for that
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
too but only before conception not
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
after my personal experience at a young
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
age dictates my current pro-life stance
 
02:17:36.589 --> 02:17:36.599 align:start position:0%
I can give faces and names to this issue
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
at age 17 before abortion was legal I
 
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
was pregnant out of we wedlock had it
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
been legal and left to my own devices
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
misgivings about the future might have
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
led me down a path of expediency via
 
02:17:53.549 --> 02:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
abortion rather than a path of conscious
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
conscience and
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
integrity fortunately it wasn't legal
 
02:18:00.190 --> 02:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
and it was also out of my hands my
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
parents subjected strongly to the idea
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
of abortion while being supportive of me
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
I surrendered my daughter for adoption
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
and later decided to have no other
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
children and more than two decades later
 
02:18:16.110 --> 02:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
my daughter Crystal contacted me when I
 
02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
met her and her husband they had two
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
daughters Cassie and Katie by this time
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
Cassie has two children Logan and Luna
 
02:18:26.190 --> 02:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
now aged six and four those five people
 
02:18:28.669 --> 02:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
are the face the name and the Beating
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
Heart of my pro-life conviction today a
 
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
decision for life always leads to
 
02:18:36.790 --> 02:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
Greater Life not only that but my future
 
02:18:39.790 --> 02:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
turned out fine too and my conscience is
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
clear to all women I say whatever our
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
personal decisions in the past we can
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
reclaim and stand up for our unique
 
02:18:48.629 --> 02:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
position as the bearers and Defenders of
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
human life a position so important so
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental yet often devalued because
 
02:18:57.070 --> 02:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
it can't be monetized nothing devalues
 
02:18:59.389 --> 02:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
it more than the practice of abortion
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
men you are not letting us down and
 
02:19:03.790 --> 02:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
depriving us of gender rights by being
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
pro-life thanks guys but the ability to
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
bear and protect life is precisely our
 
02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
strength and privilege pass laws instead
 
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
to help women and children Thrive a
 
02:19:17.790 --> 02:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
pro-life party doesn't exist in the US
 
02:19:19.629 --> 02:19:19.639 align:start position:0%
the Democratic party supports the right
 
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
to life to end life before birth the
 
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
Republican Party supports the
 
02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
proliferation of firearms so as to end
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
the lives of those who survive birth for
 
02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
over four decades I was a registered
 
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
Democrat that changed about 15 years ago
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
due to the increasingly fanatical
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
pro-abortion Zeal under the guise of
 
02:19:41.469 --> 02:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
women's Reproductive Rights respect for
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
Life put me outside the pale the
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
estimate is that at least 33% of
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%

industry she helped facilitate more than
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
22,000 abortions I really didn't even
 
02:22:32.750 --> 02:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
know how I got to that point she said it
 
02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
just happened in the blink of an eye uh
 
02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
her transition to pro-life advocacy
 
02:22:39.910 --> 02:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
started when she assisted with an
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
ultrasound guided abortion procedure at
 
02:22:46.030 --> 02:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
13 weeks the pre-born baby had every
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
bodily function and Anatomy as a fully
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
grown adult for the first time I
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
witnessed the true nature of the work
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
that she was involved in and the unborn
 
02:23:00.190 --> 02:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
baby suffering at the hands of a suction
 
02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
tube I knew in that moment that what I
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
saw in just those few seconds wasn't a
 
02:23:07.870 --> 02:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
choice it wasn't reproductive Justice it
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
was not justice of any kind it was
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
certainly not healthc care I knew that
 
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
what I witnessed in those moments was
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
murder murder murder of an innocent
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
human being in the womb and I knew I
 
02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:24.439 align:start position:0%
could not participate in that
 
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
anymore the last point I want to make is
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
another item here
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
online uh this uh this came from the
 
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
baby body parts crisis uh this is from
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh Dr westoff from planned parenting and
 
02:23:41.309 --> 02:23:41.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to read her quotes we've
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
just been working with people who want
 
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
particular tissues like you know they
 
02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
want cardiac or they want eyes or they
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
want something else sir you're at the uh
 
02:23:54.190 --> 02:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
the three you if there are quotes that
 
02:23:57.309 --> 02:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
you want to yeah I understand sir just I
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
30 seconds please uh certainly
 
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
everything we provide oh gonads oh my
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
God gonads everything we provide is
 
02:24:08.349 --> 02:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
fresh obviously we would have the
 
02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
potential for a huge PR issue if this
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
information was shared
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
publicly so I tried to uh provide to
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
this committee three scenarios from a
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
prolife perspective I believe the
 
02:24:27.389 --> 02:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
arguments from my side are more
 
02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative of the true reality of
 
02:24:33.070 --> 02:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
abortion uh than the emotional
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
experiences which I totally respect from
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
people that have had abortions I'm happy
 
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
to take questions thank you questions
 
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:40.840 align:start position:0%

02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
please hello uh good afternoon and thank
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
you to the members of the committee very
 
02:24:59.790 --> 02:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
much uh for your service and for your
 
02:25:03.070 --> 02:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
time today um my name is Sophie Maro I'm
 
02:25:04.750 --> 02:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
from Portsmouth and I'm really glad to
 
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
be here today to support cacr 23 um I'm
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
here representing myself but I do
 
02:25:12.750 --> 02:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer with the lover ring Health
 
02:25:14.269 --> 02:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
Center and with the reproductive Freedom
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
fund of New Hampshire um and in those
 
02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
roles I support abortion patients before
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
during and after their appointments
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
whether that is coordinating a ride
 
02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
helping them to access funding holding
 
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
their hand providing emotional support
 
02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
um whatever it may be I consider it an
 
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
honor to support people in this way and
 
02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
I'm really proud uh to do it um and it
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
is from this experience then that I say
 
02:25:43.309 --> 02:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
that everyone's reason for having an
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
abortion is different everyone's reason
 
02:25:48.269 --> 02:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
is valid um and everyone's reason is
 
02:25:52.429 --> 02:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
private and personal to them and never
 
02:25:55.150 --> 02:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
has anyone told me that they wish that
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
their State Rep could have been more
 
02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
involved in that
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
decision um there is no place for the
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
government in someone's reproductive
 
02:26:06.429 --> 02:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
decisions except to guarantee that that
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
person has the freedom to make those
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
decisions um the government does not
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
belong in my doctor's office or in my
 
02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
private medical decisions um because I
 
02:26:20.110 --> 02:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
can't participate equally in society if
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
somebody else gets to make those choices
 
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
for me I am not free to direct my life
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
if I don't get to be the one that has
 
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
the final say over my own health and
 
02:26:32.590 --> 02:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
well-being and importantly I am not safe
 
02:26:34.349 --> 02:26:34.359 align:start position:0%
if somebody else gets to decide what
 
02:26:38.269 --> 02:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
happens to my body so just to wrap up uh
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
later today we'll hear about uh house
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
bills 1248 and
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
1541 um both of which are proof of why
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
we need to pass c23
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
um those bills reflect policies that are
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
deeply deeply
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
unpopular um as things that can kill you
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
generally tend to be um because that's
 
02:26:59.429 --> 02:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that abortion bans
 
02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
kill and those bills are dangerous um
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and we need to stop wasting time on them
 
02:27:09.309 --> 02:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
we need to stop wasting resources on
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
them and bills like them um and we do
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
that by deciding collectively to protect
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
abortion in our constitution the dos
 
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
ruling put the onus on us to make that
 
02:27:22.349 --> 02:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
decision um so please let us make that
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
decision thank you for your time thank
 
02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
you questions for this
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.269 --> 02:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
please thank you for hearing my
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
testimony chair Lyn and members of the
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
House Judiciary Committee so I'm here to
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
oppose cacr 23 and the reason why I
 
02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
oppose it is because I believe in the
 
02:27:58.590 --> 02:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
sanctity the sacredness of all human
 
02:28:02.349 --> 02:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
life from conception to Natural death in
 
02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
our US Constitution now I'm a
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
constituent of New Hampshire but we're
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
part of the United States of America and
 
02:28:13.870 --> 02:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
in our US Constitution it says we hold
 
02:28:17.309 --> 02:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
these truths to be self-evident that we
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
are endowed by our creator with certain
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
inalienable rights that among those are
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
life liberty and the pursuit of
 
02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
happiness you can't have Liberty and you
 
02:28:30.990 --> 02:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
can't have the pursuit of happiness if
 
02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
you don't have life first now abortion
 
02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
bills have a very flawed premise or
 
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
abortion rights have a very flawed
 
02:28:43.469 --> 02:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
premise that they are based on because
 
02:28:46.830 --> 02:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
they're trying to say that a life is not
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
valid unless it reaches a certain stage
 
02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
of gestation could be birth it could be
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
24 weeks whatever it is but it's not a
 
02:28:57.870 --> 02:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
valid life and it's also a statement the
 
02:29:02.349 --> 02:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
second premise that's flawed is that we
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
Define life as being worthwhile to have
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
freedom and to have the ability to
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
pursue happiness if we decide that
 
02:29:16.269 --> 02:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
they're wanted so you have a baby that's
 
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
not wanted their life is disposable now
 
02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
back in Nazi Germany Adolf Hitler and
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
the Nazi regime they worked very hard
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
for years perhaps even decades to start
 
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
devaluing human life to their people so
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
finally they got to the point where they
 
02:29:38.190 --> 02:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
could encourage the people that we don't
 
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
want a certain class of people in that
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
situation it was the Jews and so we are
 
02:29:46.269 --> 02:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
justified in killing 6 million of them
 
02:29:48.110 --> 02:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
now this is a very slippery slope that
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
we're going down as a society and have
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
we really stooped to that level that we
 
02:29:55.630 --> 02:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
devalue life so much do we want New
 
02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be a culture of life or a
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
culture of death and I just heard a
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
testimony a few minutes ago saying that
 
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
um you have to fight for life and that
 
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
banning abortions deprives life I think
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
abortions deprived life the mother who
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
makes a decision to abort her baby is
 
02:30:18.870 --> 02:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
not deprived of Life the baby in her
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
womb is the only one that is killed so I
 
02:30:24.269 --> 02:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
think of you know we were told back in
 
02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
73 when roie Wade was passed this is not
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
going to lead to any more death it's
 
02:30:31.710 --> 02:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
just abortion it's just about the baby
 
02:30:33.309 --> 02:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
in the womb that the mother's not ready
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
to have but we have the Terry shyo case
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
and she was a disabled woman and her
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
husband said she wouldn't want to live
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
disabled like this so he made the
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
decision the court agreed with him for
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
her to be euthanized by withholding food
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
now the thing is she had no living will
 
02:30:52.950 --> 02:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
no one was there in the conversation
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
between her and her husband we don't
 
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
know if she actually said that so this
 
02:30:59.309 --> 02:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
is a very very slippery slope that we're
 
02:31:02.670 --> 02:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
going down as a society and we have the
 
02:31:05.070 --> 02:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to agree with the Supreme
 
02:31:08.269 --> 02:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
Court of the United States and stand for
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
life as they ruled Roby weade
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
overturning was a good thing and we have
 
02:31:16.110 --> 02:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
a chance even if we're one in a handful
 
02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
of States in this country that stands
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
for life we can stand for what's just
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
and true and we can stand for you're
 
02:31:24.870 --> 02:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
over your 3 minutes and if you just sum
 
02:31:27.790 --> 02:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
up I'd appreciate it okay so the bottom
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
line is I believe that all life should
 
02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
be protected from conception to Natural
 
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
death and thank you very much for
 
02:31:36.309 --> 02:31:36.319 align:start position:0%

I'm not going to take more than that um
 
02:32:19.349 --> 02:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
biological facts every U um every
 
02:32:22.750 --> 02:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
study's ever ever been done um been done
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
um human life begins a conception we all
 
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
know that that's a fact and after 8
 
02:32:32.030 --> 02:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
weeks after conception the baby's heart
 
02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
beat is detected and the baby feels
 
02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:37.590 align:start position:0%
beat is detected and the baby feels
pain

02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
pain
 
02:32:40.830 --> 02:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
and every survey uh which was mentioned
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
here earlier every survey Across America
 
02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
um particularly the Harvard Harris poll
 
02:32:50.910 --> 02:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
that 90% of all voters across the
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
country oppose abortion right up to the
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
moment of birth and 70% of independent
 
02:32:59.630 --> 02:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
voters oppose abortion right up to
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
birth so that relates to in New
 
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that remate relates that 10 to
 
02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
a maximum of 30 30% of the voters here
 
02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
in the granite state support late term
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
abortions right up to the moment of
 
02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:17.110 align:start position:0%
abortions right up to the moment of
birth

02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
birth
 
02:33:20.110 --> 02:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
this is Extreme this is radical and this
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
is poor legislation for the State of New

afternoon but I just want the committee
 
02:34:25.710 --> 02:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
to know what I've been going through
 
02:34:27.269 --> 02:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
this morning sitting
 
02:34:30.910 --> 02:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
here um I you
 
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
know I suffer from a little
 
02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:34.950 align:start position:0%
know I suffer from a little
post-traumatic

02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic
 
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
stress um disorder and I have a history
 
02:34:41.349 --> 02:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a woman and uh the testimonies
 
02:34:44.429 --> 02:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
that I've heard today have been very
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
varied so we've heard heard a lot of
 
02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:47.990 align:start position:0%
varied so we've heard heard a lot of
different

02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
stories uh every
 
02:34:53.469 --> 02:34:53.479 align:start position:0%
situation that involves bringing a new
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
person into this world is
 
02:34:59.190 --> 02:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
unique and that's why I feel like it
 
02:35:01.469 --> 02:35:01.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't really belong with the Judiciary
 
02:35:04.110 --> 02:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
commit the Judiciary Committee and I
 
02:35:06.990 --> 02:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
will be here this afternoon to testify
 
02:35:11.269 --> 02:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
on the other bill because really this
 
02:35:12.590 --> 02:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
comes down
 
02:35:16.190 --> 02:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
to uh our first amendment rights to
 
02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
exercise our own
 
02:35:21.469 --> 02:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
beliefs and so some people here believe
 
02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
that life starts at conception and maybe
 
02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
it does I'm not really saying that it
 
02:35:30.309 --> 02:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't it could actually start at
 
02:35:32.110 --> 02:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
conception maybe it does that's up for
 
02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:33.309 align:start position:0%
conception maybe it does that's up for
the

02:35:33.309 --> 02:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:35:33.319 --> 02:35:34.910 align:start position:0%
the
scientists

02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
scientists
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
but uh the sanctity of my
 
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
conception I I have God has given me
 
02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
life and I'm grateful for the life that
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
I've been
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
given but I also believe that I have the
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
right over my own body and my own
 
02:35:59.790 --> 02:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
decisions and I've had to make those
 
02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
decisions in my life I've been on both
 
02:36:04.190 --> 02:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
ends of the
 
02:36:07.389 --> 02:36:07.399 align:start position:0%
Spectrum in my life I've had to make
 
02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
decisions to make abortions I've had
 
02:36:12.269 --> 02:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
decisions to keep my child and I have
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
lost a child at 16 weeks and none of
 
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
that belongs none of those decisions
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
government belongs with me and my
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
relationship to
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
God right thank you my belief my belief
 
02:36:36.510 --> 02:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
and my religion and we have freedom of
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
religion and every other testimony here
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
when it comes to right of Life deals
 
02:36:42.319 --> 02:36:43.590 align:start position:0%
when it comes to right of Life deals
with

02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:36:46.349 --> 02:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
God and we have the the right to
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
religion first okay so it is up to the
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
woman and I I think this uh vote is for
 
02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
the protection of women because it
 
02:36:59.269 --> 02:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
involves medical
 
02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
personnel and the medical personnel
 
02:37:04.429 --> 02:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
still needs to be involved in the care
 
02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
and protection of a woman you can't just
 
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
say that all life is sanct is Sanctified
 
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
when you hear the testimony of a woman
 
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
who almost lost her life because uh she
 
02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
and she needed a DNC for that right so
 
02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
if you say if you make a decision like
 
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
that you're putting other women's life
 
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
at risk and that's not your decision
 
02:37:30.469 --> 02:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
that's not your decision you're also
 
02:37:31.710 --> 02:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
making the
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
decision to murder live women women who
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
are already alive on this planet doing
 
02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
things like taking care of other
 
02:37:42.510 --> 02:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
children she's a doctor and her life was
 
02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
at risk she takes care she's a medical
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
Prof professional we need to have
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
respect for the people in our society to
 
02:37:52.670 --> 02:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
do the jobs that they need to do and
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
give that responsibility to our medical
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
personnel and I'm here talking now but I
 
02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
am going to be here this afternoon uh
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
because I wouldn't be here now if it
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't for those bills that you have
 
02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and I'm a little bit
 
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
confused as to why you have those bills
 
02:38:13.710 --> 02:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and you have this bill
 
02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
this bill should be brought up to the
 
02:38:17.950 --> 02:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
population of the state of New Hampshire
 
02:38:20.830 --> 02:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
to be voted on because it is ultimately
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
the people's that's why that's the
 
02:38:25.150 --> 02:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
definition of a democracy is for us to
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
be able to vote on these things not for
 
02:38:30.030 --> 02:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
a Judiciary Committee to make those
 
02:38:32.110 --> 02:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
decisions so I do hope it goes up for
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
vote and whatever these other bills are
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon I'm going to get up and
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear the same thing
 
02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
except that it's going to be in written
 
02:38:42.750 --> 02:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and you're you know I I really
 
02:38:45.269 --> 02:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
think that we have precedent here in the
 
02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution and the New
 
02:38:50.230 --> 02:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution that protects a
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
woman's right to make this decision for
 
02:38:55.269 --> 02:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
herself so thank you thank

up a few things that I brought up even
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
this morning and and we talked about the
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh cacr bill but in essence we're still
 
03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
talking about a life of a child a baby
 
03:39:42.510 --> 03:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
at this point and it's not going away
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
all right we're not trying we're trying
 
03:39:47.469 --> 03:39:47.479 align:start position:0%
to protect life and save life where the
 
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
other side or the sponsors or or the
 
03:39:51.389 --> 03:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
people against this bill are trying to
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
actually destroy life and kill it and
 
03:39:55.269 --> 03:39:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's not a
 
03:40:00.429 --> 03:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
growth you know it's not a uh a tumor
 
03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know it's an individual being I mean
 
03:40:07.349 --> 03:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
from once that when that once the the
 
03:40:09.070 --> 03:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
woman and the man get together and they
 
03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
do the ACT IM and that uh uh that seed
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
actually penetrates the egg it is
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
immediately starting to be a unique
 
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
human being you're talking about hair
 
03:40:22.710 --> 03:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
color eye color skin color height maybe
 
03:40:25.469 --> 03:40:25.479 align:start position:0%
even weight um and anything else that
 
03:40:27.830 --> 03:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
goes along with the body at that point
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
so I mean this is very interesting I
 
03:40:31.630 --> 03:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
mean it's not like science we can't
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
create this stuff and I don't understand
 
03:40:36.429 --> 03:40:36.439 align:start position:0%
why we're trying to destroy it it makes
 
03:40:39.870 --> 03:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
no sense to destroy it so I just want to
 
03:40:41.870 --> 03:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
bring up a few items here that I that I
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
had gotten written down here you know we
 
03:40:46.590 --> 03:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
I heard even this morning it's like my
 
03:40:49.389 --> 03:40:49.399 align:start position:0%
body my choice and and God I mean I keep
 
03:40:51.030 --> 03:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
hearing it over and over and over my
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
body my choice you know isn't that the
 
03:40:55.870 --> 03:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
time of choice wouldn't that be the time
 
03:40:57.870 --> 03:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
when you're actually having the sex
 
03:41:00.790 --> 03:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
taking the sex doing the sex I mean
 
03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
seriously isn't it isn't that the time
 
03:41:04.189 --> 03:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
you you know you make the choice of
 
03:41:08.110 --> 03:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
saying should I protect myself or
 
03:41:12.030 --> 03:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
not what about at that point after
 
03:41:14.590 --> 03:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
they've had the sex at that point the
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
child that starts to grow immediately
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
what about the she's a woman it could be
 
03:41:22.149 --> 03:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
a woman or it could be a man but let's
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
assume she's a woman what about her
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
choice what about her rights you know
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's like you're you're only protecting
 
03:41:31.550 --> 03:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
the living outside because you can
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
physically see a person but just because
 
03:41:35.670 --> 03:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
you can't physically see someone doesn't
 
03:41:37.389 --> 03:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
mean they're not
 
03:41:40.269 --> 03:41:40.279 align:start position:0%
existing and and and again you you just
 
03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
keep trying to kill this child over and
 
03:41:47.590 --> 03:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
over and and it's it's just as
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
legislators we're
 
03:41:52.510 --> 03:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
actually having license or we making the
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
law to say we have the right to murder
 
03:41:59.070 --> 03:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
think about it we're creating the law
 
03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
that says hey you can abort your child
 
03:42:04.429 --> 03:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
right now it's 24 weeks 6
 
03:42:06.750 --> 03:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
months we say you can go ahead and kill
 
03:42:09.550 --> 03:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
your child you can murder your child at
 
03:42:12.269 --> 03:42:12.279 align:start position:0%
that point up until 6 months we're the
 
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
lawmakers we have to determine that and
 
03:42:16.870 --> 03:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
to say this is where we have to look at
 
03:42:19.349 --> 03:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
morality and ter you know and say wait
 
03:42:21.229 --> 03:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
you know where are we going as a
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
morality and people of New Hampshire you
 
03:42:26.990 --> 03:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
know I have a document here that I got
 
03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:28.469 align:start position:0%
know I have a document here that I got
from

03:42:28.469 --> 03:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
U Americans United for life they did
 
03:42:33.630 --> 03:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
some research for me which I appreciate
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
what they did and I'm I'm just going to
 
03:42:37.630 --> 03:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
read a couple things and what I can do
 
03:42:39.710 --> 03:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
is I'll send it to the entire committee
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
you you guys can look through it it's
 
03:42:44.429 --> 03:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
about 63 pages and you know we we're
 
03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to just rehash the same things
 
03:42:47.630 --> 03:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
over and over this bill the first bill
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
the next bill at this point um but I
 
03:42:53.550 --> 03:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
just want to kind of put on a couple
 
03:42:56.030 --> 03:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
things which is you know you to start
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
thinking about these couple of things
 
03:42:57.720 --> 03:42:58.910 align:start position:0%
thinking about these couple of things
they're

03:42:58.910 --> 03:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
irritating says most abortions are done
 
03:43:05.110 --> 03:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
social for social reasons not because
 
03:43:07.309 --> 03:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
the baby or the mother is
 
03:43:10.750 --> 03:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
medical then it goes on it says the gut
 
03:43:13.110 --> 03:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
Institute has provided a number of
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
reports over two decades that have
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
identified the reasons why women choose
 
03:43:21.309 --> 03:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
abortion and they have been consistently
 
03:43:24.070 --> 03:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
reported that childbearing would
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
interfere with their education work and
 
03:43:30.790 --> 03:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
ability to care for existing dependence
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:43:35.670 --> 03:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
on overall common exceptions to
 
03:43:38.429 --> 03:43:38.439 align:start position:0%
abortions restrictions are estimated uh
 
03:43:41.790 --> 03:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
to account for less than than 5% of all
 
03:43:45.149 --> 03:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
abortions all right less than
 
03:43:49.149 --> 03:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
5% meaning the 95% of abortions are
 
03:43:54.429 --> 03:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
for um elective or unspecified reasons
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
95% this is what we're talking about I
 
03:43:59.309 --> 03:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
mean the 5% yes if the woman needs the
 
03:44:01.149 --> 03:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
help you know there's something going
 
03:44:03.189 --> 03:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
wrong with her life and you know
 
03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
something happened in your life yes I
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
get it you know save the woman for all M
 
03:44:09.550 --> 03:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
you know all possibilities but you know
 
03:44:11.590 --> 03:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
this here
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
95% we saying take that baby just throw
 
03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
it in the trash can someone said we
 
03:44:18.429 --> 03:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
should all go down to an abortion clinic
 
03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
and watch one done I watch a video even
 
03:44:22.990 --> 03:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
it be amazing you you you might change
 
03:44:25.309 --> 03:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
your mind just by watching
 
03:44:27.389 --> 03:44:27.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm just going to point out maybe
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.630 --> 03:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
here if it goes on it
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
um it says it goes on the belief that a
 
03:44:45.790 --> 03:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
woman needs abor the belief that a that
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
women need abortion in order to obtain
 
03:44:52.349 --> 03:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
Su success and equality in American
 
03:44:55.870 --> 03:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
society is unfounded and a um accurately
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
harms women basically this this goes on
 
03:45:01.110 --> 03:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
to say
 
03:45:01.120 --> 03:45:02.950 align:start position:0%
to say
that

03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
um women are harmed by abortions active
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
activist equality uh B uh arguing
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
because it easily communicates the
 
03:45:15.670 --> 03:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
woman's pregnancy the woman's pregnancy
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
and parenting is a
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
disability it's not a disability it's a
 
03:45:23.429 --> 03:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
blessing it truly is a
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
blessing and and it goes on last part of
 
03:45:30.710 --> 03:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
this says uh um parent is a disability
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
it for most femal suff and most female
 
03:45:37.550 --> 03:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
suffer therefore it explicitly or
 
03:45:40.389 --> 03:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
implicitly assumes that the male body is
 
03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
the and reproduction model is the Nom
 
03:45:46.309 --> 03:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's not the case this I mean
 
03:45:47.710 --> 03:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
we can just go over and over and over
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
and over you we all have to come to this
 
03:45:51.950 --> 03:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
morality part of our life here and say
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
you know come on let's let's we all know
 
03:45:56.510 --> 03:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
the truth all right there are some
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
abortions that absolutely need to happen
 
03:46:02.189 --> 03:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
there are 95% of them that don't and we
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
can't be the ones given the license for
 
03:46:06.950 --> 03:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
the law we got to stop this if it's 15
 
03:46:08.830 --> 03:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
days 15 weeks we got to stop but
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
actually it should be from conception
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
and really I'll admit that 15 days is
 
03:46:16.990 --> 03:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
technically from conception thank you
 
03:46:18.830 --> 03:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this
 
03:46:22.710 --> 03:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
trip uh thank you for taking my question
 
03:46:29.630 --> 03:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh I since you said that 95% of the
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
abortions are elective could do you have
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
any statistics on when in the pregnancy
 
03:46:40.110 --> 03:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
these uh elective uh abortions occur say
 
03:46:43.149 --> 03:46:43.159 align:start position:0%
at the 15-day Mark or the 15 week month
 
03:46:46.269 --> 03:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
or the 24 week Mark uh it in this
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
article here it does not say which I am
 
03:46:49.870 --> 03:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
going to pass the entire article on for
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
you and it's again it's only six R pages
 
03:46:54.349 --> 03:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
and and they also reference all the
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
footnotes and where they have all their
 
03:46:58.950 --> 03:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
information from all right so that does
 
03:47:01.070 --> 03:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
not say if it was like from the first
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
week to you know the 27th week or
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:11.149 --> 03:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
Witness none thank you very much thank
 
03:47:13.030 --> 03:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh next I'm going to call
 
03:47:22.870 --> 03:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you um Mary hecken
 
03:47:27.429 --> 03:47:27.439 align:start position:0%
Phillips representing Grafton County
 
03:47:29.830 --> 03:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
District 12 I rise today in opposition
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
of hb1
 
03:47:34.349 --> 03:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
1248 let's just say you ignore the
 
03:47:37.309 --> 03:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
science that at 15 days it's difficult
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
to determine exact just age because
 
03:47:42.630 --> 03:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about two to four
 
03:47:44.670 --> 03:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
cells instead of a
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
fetus let's just ignore the fact that at
 
03:47:49.710 --> 03:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
15 days nothing would show up at an
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
ultrasound and no diagnosis of a
 
03:47:54.429 --> 03:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
mother's health or a baby's prospective
 
03:47:57.389 --> 03:47:57.399 align:start position:0%
Health Care can be made Let's just
 
03:47:59.429 --> 03:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
ignore the fact that at 15 days
 
03:48:02.110 --> 03:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
Physicians can't knowingly locate let
 
03:48:04.990 --> 03:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
alone perform any procedure on said 2 to
 
03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:06.870 align:start position:0%
alone perform any procedure on said 2 to
four

03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:48:10.510 --> 03:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
cells Let's ignore the fact that at days
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
um an abortion ban would further Drive
 
03:48:15.149 --> 03:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
obgy surgeons and Physicians from
 
03:48:17.950 --> 03:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire creating a
 
03:48:20.070 --> 03:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancy care and reproductive Cancer
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
Care desert for all of our
 
03:48:25.550 --> 03:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
families let's just ignore that more
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
than 75% of granite Staters who believe
 
03:48:29.469 --> 03:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
that reproductive Choice should be
 
03:48:31.550 --> 03:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
available to pregnant
 
03:48:34.590 --> 03:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
people Let's ignore the unfair Financial
 
03:48:36.950 --> 03:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
impacts on women and pregnant people who
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
are denied abortion care aiming in dead
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%

03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
progress Let's ignore the vast majority
 
03:48:47.750 --> 03:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
of granite Staters who believe that
 
03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
government should have no place in the
 
03:48:52.590 --> 03:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
medical decision-making or interfering
 
03:48:55.229 --> 03:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
with granite St Staters
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
privacy Let's ignore the other do
 
03:49:00.189 --> 03:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
denominations of Christianity and
 
03:49:03.950 --> 03:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
religion that believe abortion is moral
 
03:49:06.550 --> 03:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
Humane and a true expression of God's
 
03:49:09.950 --> 03:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
love and Let's ignore the fact that a
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
cruel 15-day abortion ban would
 
03:49:14.309 --> 03:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
effectively be signing the death
 
03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
warrants for granite Staters who
 
03:49:18.590 --> 03:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
experience complications in pregnancy
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
and run out of time or cannot afford to
 
03:49:22.510 --> 03:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
travel to other states to get the health
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
care that we need so let's just ignore
 
03:49:27.670 --> 03:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
all that science logic fact reason
 
03:49:30.110 --> 03:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
Humanity let's pass this unconscionable
 
03:49:34.590 --> 03:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
Bill Let's be clear passage of hb1 1248
 
03:49:37.349 --> 03:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
will accelerate the quickening pace of
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
the voting age electorate in New
 
03:49:42.309 --> 03:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that runs not walks away from
 
03:49:44.910 --> 03:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
the Republican party for either more
 
03:49:46.590 --> 03:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
independent or more democratic
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
candidates who will protect independent
 
03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
medical decisionmaking and the right to
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
reproductive healthc care Choice let
 
03:49:56.030 --> 03:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
this be a warning to you a 15-day
 
03:49:58.830 --> 03:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
abortion ban will trigger a generational
 
03:50:00.510 --> 03:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
political wave against trusting
 
03:50:03.510 --> 03:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
Republicans to draft public policy for
 
03:50:06.269 --> 03:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
which the G GOP will never fully fully
 
03:50:08.790 --> 03:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
recover in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:50:11.229 --> 03:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
Passage of 1248 will be a strategic
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
failure and a colossal mistake and for
 
03:50:15.670 --> 03:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
these reasons I implore members of this
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
committee to vote in expedient to
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you thank you questions
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative gon thank you
 
03:50:27.710 --> 03:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
03:50:29.790 --> 03:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
for taking our questions you said that
 
03:50:32.670 --> 03:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
in 15 days there's only two to four
 
03:50:35.830 --> 03:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
cells let alone a fetus so when is there
 
03:50:39.389 --> 03:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
a fetus uh thank you for the question um
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
so I am not a healthc care physician I
 
03:50:44.429 --> 03:50:44.439 align:start position:0%
am married to one and um I do not hold
 
03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
the expertise to um to delineate when a
 
03:50:50.269 --> 03:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
fetus becomes into existence but I think
 
03:50:53.349 --> 03:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
we should recognize that at 15 days from
 
03:50:54.910 --> 03:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
the point of pregnancy we are not
 
03:50:56.750 --> 03:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
talking about a heartbeat we're not
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
talking about cardiac activity we're not
 
03:51:00.389 --> 03:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
talking about hearts and lungs we're not
 
03:51:02.550 --> 03:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
talking about hands and fingertips and
 
03:51:04.870 --> 03:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
feet we're talking about two to four
 
03:51:07.349 --> 03:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
cells so I think we just need to
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that you know that is not
 
03:51:11.229 --> 03:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
something that a woman will even know
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
she's pregnant at that point because
 
03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
there is no physical embodiment that
 
03:51:16.269 --> 03:51:16.279 align:start position:0%
would cause a woman to know they're
 
03:51:19.309 --> 03:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
pregnant at that point Thank you other
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:51:26.870 --> 03:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
next representative Perez did you wish
 
03:51:26.880 --> 03:51:38.149 align:start position:0%
next representative Perez did you wish
to

03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%

testify

03:51:47.030 --> 03:51:47.040 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:51:51.309 --> 03:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
committee um I was an original signer on
 
03:51:53.349 --> 03:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
this bill I would like to read quickly
 
03:51:57.309 --> 03:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
to you my um apology to my constituents
 
03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
to my federal fed fellow um
 
03:52:04.790 --> 03:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislators uh HB 1248 does not
 
03:52:06.910 --> 03:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
represent my the voice of my
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
constituents I have withdrawn my name as
 
03:52:11.429 --> 03:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor when I was first approached
 
03:52:14.469 --> 03:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
with the intent of this proposed bill I
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
was told that it would be offer it would
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
offer lowering the existing limit of 6
 
03:52:22.269 --> 03:52:22.279 align:start position:0%
months 24 weeks without restrictions to
 
03:52:25.710 --> 03:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
3.5 months 15 weeks without restrictions
 
03:52:28.189 --> 03:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
for pregnancy termination when the draft
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
was released from the office of
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislative Services I did not do my due
 
03:52:35.429 --> 03:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
diligence and neglected to review the
 
03:52:37.349 --> 03:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
proposal prior to AG greeting to
 
03:52:40.670 --> 03:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this was my mistake I and
 
03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
admittedly a grave one I trusted but did
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
not verify but this was not being
 
03:52:48.269 --> 03:52:48.279 align:start position:0%
offered as an excuse I had heard from
 
03:52:50.910 --> 03:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
multiple constituents that they felt a
 
03:52:54.149 --> 03:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
15 week limit was more in line with what
 
03:52:56.590 --> 03:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
they would be comfortable supporting
 
03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
based on that and prior tentatively
 
03:53:01.830 --> 03:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
agreeing to this bill I researched all
 
03:53:04.870 --> 03:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy clinics in New Hampshire I
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
researched um in New Hampshire that
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
offered um that offer pregnancy
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
termination including Planned Parenthood
 
03:53:15.429 --> 03:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
I found that medical abortions are only
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
offered up to 10 to 11 weeks with as an
 
03:53:20.710 --> 03:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
aspiration or dilations are offered
 
03:53:24.790 --> 03:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
between 13 and 15 week six days except
 
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
for Planned Parenthood which offers um
 
03:53:30.550 --> 03:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
Pro aspirations from 14 to 16 and
 
03:53:33.070 --> 03:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
dilation procedures up to 20 we one
 
03:53:35.149 --> 03:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
weeks here in New Hampshire although I
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
am adamantly pro-life I have I have said
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
I have said since first announcing my
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
run for representative that I would not
 
03:53:47.469 --> 03:53:47.479 align:start position:0%
have my Personal Agenda but instead be a
 
03:53:50.030 --> 03:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
voice your voice that continues to be my
 
03:53:52.469 --> 03:53:52.479 align:start position:0%
pledge I'm truly sorry that potentially
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
misrepresented misrepresented your voice
 
03:53:58.110 --> 03:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
it was not my intention and therefore
 
03:54:00.030 --> 03:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
please accept my
 
03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
withdrawal I take full responsibility
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
that all being said I too like
 
03:54:09.389 --> 03:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
representative patau found
 
03:54:12.670 --> 03:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
that not one of the individuals that I
 
03:54:15.910 --> 03:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
encountered during my run for office had
 
03:54:20.070 --> 03:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
any idea of what the law was here in New
 
03:54:23.790 --> 03:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they had no idea that we had a
 
03:54:26.710 --> 03:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
six-month Li uh allowance for abortions
 
03:54:29.229 --> 03:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
for any reason in the states I have
 
03:54:31.830 --> 03:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
since I have since becoming elected had
 
03:54:34.830 --> 03:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
multiple constituents reach out to the
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
state that 6 months is too long why that
 
03:54:41.469 --> 03:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
is why I continually questioned in the
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
last hearing why 24 weeks um when I
 
03:54:47.630 --> 03:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
explained to those not aware that they
 
03:54:49.469 --> 03:54:49.479 align:start position:0%
were surprised that it was abortion was
 
03:54:51.710 --> 03:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
allowed that high that is one of the
 
03:54:56.750 --> 03:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
reasons when speaking about CR2 cacr I
 
03:54:59.389 --> 03:54:59.399 align:start position:0%
kept asking the question I am prolife
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
but I was not elected to represent
 
03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
myself I believe that the 24 weeks is
 
03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
way too high the constituents want 15
 
03:55:14.149 --> 03:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
weeks and people are so
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
uninformed about what the actual laws
 
03:55:20.590 --> 03:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
are here in New Hampshire that we need
 
03:55:23.950 --> 03:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
to guide them until they can become
 
03:55:26.670 --> 03:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
informed thank you thank you uh
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%

03:56:42.670 --> 03:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
with with him about this
 
03:56:46.229 --> 03:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
topic because legis similar legislation
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh was also being heard at that time to
 
03:56:51.309 --> 03:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
restrict access to this important piece
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
of health care which affects o around
 
03:56:58.750 --> 03:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
population and it's amazing me to me
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we really even have anything left
 
03:57:05.950 --> 03:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
to discuss but here we are so as you
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
know with that timeline I also grew up
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
in a time when when people were dying
 
03:57:14.670 --> 03:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
because they were not able to find a
 
03:57:19.630 --> 03:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
medically safe abortion place to have an
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
abortion many folks lost family members
 
03:57:25.830 --> 03:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
I know families that lost family members
 
03:57:29.110 --> 03:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
and mothers of families during this
 
03:57:32.110 --> 03:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
time and so I understand the
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
repercussions about restricting abortion
 
03:57:37.870 --> 03:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
access so during these discussions I
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
obviously shared stories I shared my own
 
03:57:44.790 --> 03:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
story but I presented them as my friend
 
03:57:47.670 --> 03:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
stories I also did share my friend
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
stories with my father who had struggled
 
03:57:53.349 --> 03:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
with this topic and I managed to get my
 
03:57:55.950 --> 03:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
father to see the other side quote
 
03:57:58.469 --> 03:57:58.479 align:start position:0%
unquote of this issue to see that this
 
03:58:01.349 --> 03:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
was a matter of individual rights
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
freedom and liberty to make decisions
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
about our own
 
03:58:10.750 --> 03:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
bodies while I did not share that to
 
03:58:12.149 --> 03:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
with my dad that some of these stories
 
03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
were about me today I will gladly stand
 
03:58:17.510 --> 03:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
here and tell you all that abortion
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
saved my life saved it and so while
 
03:58:25.349 --> 03:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about life and death and
 
03:58:25.359 --> 03:58:26.590 align:start position:0%
we're talking about life and death and
human

03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
human
 
03:58:29.429 --> 03:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
beings I'm one of the people right and
 
03:58:31.950 --> 03:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
women or people that can get pregnant
 
03:58:33.790 --> 03:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
those are the people that we're talking
 
03:58:36.790 --> 03:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
about who deserve to have rights
 
03:58:40.229 --> 03:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise we are not full citizens
 
03:58:44.110 --> 03:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.630 --> 03:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
so the other part that saved my life is
 
03:58:48.990 --> 03:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that I did not have to tell my
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
father about
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
this and I don't know if any of you
 
03:58:54.910 --> 03:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
understand the repercussions of a young
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
person telling their parent who does not
 
03:58:59.950 --> 03:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
agree with their decision what what
 
03:59:03.229 --> 03:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
kinds of consequences can come of that
 
03:59:06.670 --> 03:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
to I Knew other options were not going
 
03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
to work for me
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
abortion adoption
 
03:59:16.990 --> 03:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
while a great option for some people I
 
03:59:18.750 --> 03:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
knew it would not work for me I knew I
 
03:59:20.469 --> 03:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
would not be able to give birth to a
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
baby and then give it up for adoption I
 
03:59:25.229 --> 03:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
already knew
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
that I also knew that I had not finished
 
03:59:32.110 --> 03:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
College I had other goals in my life to
 
03:59:35.070 --> 03:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
finish college to have a career and that
 
03:59:37.149 --> 03:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
if I became pregnant and gave birth to
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
that child that I was more likely to
 
03:59:45.189 --> 03:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
have to be on Public Assistance or
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
Services I was not going to have the
 
03:59:49.550 --> 03:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
career I wanted because I was not going
 
03:59:52.229 --> 03:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
to be able to finish school and I am not
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
lying as other I think someone else this
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
morning um said I'm not a liar that is
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
an actual truth that is the actual truth
 
04:00:03.870 --> 04:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm standing here to tell you my
 
04:00:06.670 --> 04:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
truth so for me that decision was fairly
 
04:00:09.910 --> 04:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
simple but many folks folks who even
 
04:00:13.149 --> 04:00:13.159 align:start position:0%
support having a choice may also
 
04:00:15.910 --> 04:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
struggle with that decision for many
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
reasons whether it's an individual thing
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
or a group or family thing or a
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
spiritual thing or an economic thing
 
04:00:28.189 --> 04:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's not always an easy cut and dry
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
decision as many folks seemingly would
 
04:00:34.469 --> 04:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
like to portray people who have
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
abortions many pregnant people simply do
 
04:00:39.950 --> 04:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
not know that that they are pregnant in
 
04:00:43.030 --> 04:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
the early stages most discover I would
 
04:00:45.389 --> 04:00:45.399 align:start position:0%
say around 30 days when their
 
04:00:47.910 --> 04:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
menstration cycle has
 
04:00:51.229 --> 04:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
failed to initiate for that month that
 
04:00:53.990 --> 04:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
is generally when someone would seek a
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancy test or medical care so
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
restricting that right even by reducing
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that one can follow
 
04:01:04.870 --> 04:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
through like getting appointments and
 
04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
counseling would be a violation of the
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
United States con constitution in my
 
04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
view by restricting a person's right to
 
04:01:12.840 --> 04:01:14.870 align:start position:0%
view by restricting a person's right to
bodily

04:01:14.870 --> 04:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
bodily
 
04:01:17.910 --> 04:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
autonomy now bily autonomy this is my
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
final piece bily autonomy is also at the
 
04:01:22.750 --> 04:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of medical ethics and I'm a
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
healthc care organizer for my profession
 
04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
so I read a lot about Healthcare medical
 
04:01:31.030 --> 04:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
ethics is really important to me and
 
04:01:32.910 --> 04:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
it's the build it's one of the building
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
blocks literally of our freedom and our
 
04:01:38.910 --> 04:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
Liberty we are free to refuse refuse
 
04:01:42.189 --> 04:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
medical treatment if we choose we can
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
even get a second or even third opinion
 
04:01:48.590 --> 04:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
and ultimately whatever decision we
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
make we get to either reap the rewards
 
04:01:53.510 --> 04:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
or suffer the
 
04:01:56.950 --> 04:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
consequences even if someone did not
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
agree with our choice it was ours to
 
04:02:05.389 --> 04:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
make and I will just end on
 
04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise we are not free in the state
 
04:02:11.070 --> 04:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that proclaims that it
 
04:02:13.950 --> 04:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
stands for these ideals or that we would
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise be better off
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
dead Live Free or Die death is not the
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
worst of evils we say
 
04:02:29.429 --> 04:02:29.439 align:start position:0%
that I'm asking you to please protect
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
our rights our individual rights as
 
04:02:32.319 --> 04:02:33.950 align:start position:0%
our rights our individual rights as
human

04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
human
 
04:02:36.910 --> 04:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
beings thank you so much for considering
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
my testimony today do you have have any
 
04:02:40.229 --> 04:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much questions
 
04:02:43.630 --> 04:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:47.950 --> 04:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:02:53.309 --> 04:02:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
question it's a complex issue it sure is
 
04:02:59.710 --> 04:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of uh nuances and
 
04:03:01.950 --> 04:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances that have been discussed
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
here and uh earlier on in testimony yes
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
I was here this morning and
 
04:03:11.070 --> 04:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
we can appreciate the hardship and the
 
04:03:14.429 --> 04:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
struggle and the difficulty in making
 
04:03:16.830 --> 04:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
choices but one of the things that I
 
04:03:19.630 --> 04:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
haven't heard about is
 
04:03:23.590 --> 04:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
when do we consider the life of the
 
04:03:25.950 --> 04:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
nassin human being that's being formed
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the womb when does that individual
 
04:03:31.710 --> 04:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
person have rights under the
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution and how do we balance that
 
04:03:36.670 --> 04:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
with the personal decisions that you
 
04:03:38.990 --> 04:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
just talked about
 
04:03:41.149 --> 04:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I guess that is the con
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
conundrum for many
 
04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I can answer that
 
04:03:50.910 --> 04:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
question because it is so
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a doctor I'm not a um I
 
04:03:58.910 --> 04:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
consider myself maybe a philosopher uh
 
04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
but I personally believe that it's birth
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
it is birth while it is a living being
 
04:04:07.630 --> 04:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
we don't actually consider them a human
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
being don't get a Social Security number
 
04:04:12.429 --> 04:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
they don't get any health you know the
 
04:04:14.189 --> 04:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
mother is getting the healthc care not
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily the baby at that point until
 
04:04:18.590 --> 04:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
we're really in the last trimester I
 
04:04:21.389 --> 04:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
would say that's my understanding I I
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
will stand here today and tell you I am
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
the mother of a 22-year-old son and so I
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
I know both sides of this and I did I I
 
04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
had my son when I was ready to have a
 
04:04:36.429 --> 04:04:36.439 align:start position:0%
family when I had a more secure life
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
where I was married and I
 
04:04:42.070 --> 04:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
was had a house to live in a lot of my
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
life when I was younger was not so
 
04:04:46.670 --> 04:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
stable and I didn't think it would be
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
fair to bring a life into the world as
 
04:04:54.070 --> 04:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
it is without being having the capacity
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
or the means to take care of that child
 
04:04:59.950 --> 04:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
and even when one is adopted that also
 
04:05:02.590 --> 04:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
means that they are receiving some sort
 
04:05:04.990 --> 04:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
of services right they're in some kind
 
04:05:08.950 --> 04:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
of um institution if you will or program
 
04:05:12.670 --> 04:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
for children who do not have families
 
04:05:16.149 --> 04:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
and so it's still a burden if you will
 
04:05:18.750 --> 04:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
on our
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
services either way so I don't I I guess
 
04:05:26.590 --> 04:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's not really the the whole point I
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
guess is
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
because frankly it's it's it's happening
 
04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
in my body right or a woman's body
 
04:05:36.149 --> 04:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
somebody that has a uterus let's just
 
04:05:40.349 --> 04:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
say that right right other questions for
 
04:05:40.359 --> 04:05:42.269 align:start position:0%
say that right right other questions for
this

04:05:42.269 --> 04:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
witness followup yes yeah thank
 
04:05:51.750 --> 04:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
you so it's got to be a difficult
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
decision sure for each individual as to
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
when the value of that life in the
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
womb deserves to be sure born or
 
04:06:06.800 --> 04:06:08.710 align:start position:0%
womb deserves to be sure born or
otherwise

04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
CC but what I'm getting at here is the
 
04:06:17.070 --> 04:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
job that the legislators have to do is
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
to set some guidelines and we did that
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
with the fetal Life protection act and
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is it uh 15 days 15
 
04:06:32.790 --> 04:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
weeks 18 weeks 24 weeks um Planned
 
04:06:36.030 --> 04:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
Parenthood versus Casey uh focused on
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
the viability when when um a a life in
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
the womb could conceivably live outside
 
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
on its own sure I mean these are guide
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
posts sure but and they may be different
 
04:06:50.670 --> 04:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
for each each person I think you're
 
04:06:52.710 --> 04:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
you're asking me a question that is not
 
04:06:57.550 --> 04:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
in my expertise and I'm not a doctor and
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
I don't claim to be one on
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
TV um that was humor by the way
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and I think what you
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
are which you're you're you're getting
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
at that timeline and restricting that
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
timeline knowing what I know about how
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
hard it is to to have access to health
 
04:07:21.309 --> 04:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
care right now especially in our state
 
04:07:22.990 --> 04:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
because we have had a hard time
 
04:07:23.000 --> 04:07:24.349 align:start position:0%
because we have had a hard time
retaining

04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
doctors I've literally gone out of state
 
04:07:29.070 --> 04:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
to receive health care because I can get
 
04:07:31.630 --> 04:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
it faster in Massachusetts than I can in
 
04:07:31.640 --> 04:07:32.590 align:start position:0%
it faster in Massachusetts than I can in
New

04:07:32.590 --> 04:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the weight time was
 
04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
significantly less and so
 
04:07:41.550 --> 04:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
with that said that those decisions are
 
04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
very complicated we should give people
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
the time they need and deserve to make
 
04:07:51.630 --> 04:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
that difficult decision and not rush
 
04:07:54.149 --> 04:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
them doctors are going to have their own
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
opinions because they know more about
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
the human body they may have other
 
04:08:03.309 --> 04:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations but that is all between
 
04:08:07.070 --> 04:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
a person an individual and their doctor
 
04:08:09.309 --> 04:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
and their family and whoever they have
 
04:08:11.469 --> 04:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
in their Circle it is not the business
 
04:08:15.429 --> 04:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
of legislators to restrict our rights
 
04:08:18.070 --> 04:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
this has been a medical procedure for a
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
long time now we just want to keep it
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
safe and
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
accessible whether you agree with that
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
or not whether you want to have an
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
abortion or not is nobody's business but
 
04:08:32.590 --> 04:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here to tell you I'm out here I
 
04:08:34.510 --> 04:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
don't really want to come here and tell
 
04:08:36.189 --> 04:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
you about the fact that I've had an
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
abortion but I'm here today because it
 
04:08:41.950 --> 04:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
was an important decision in my life and
 
04:08:45.149 --> 04:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
I still feel that I made the right
 
04:08:46.950 --> 04:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
decision for
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
me would I make the same decision now or
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
when I was of childbearing age no maybe
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
not I might have had a different
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
decision was my fetus viable these are
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
all like what if questions and it's
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
still those conversations belong between
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
the pregnant person and their providers
 
04:09:11.950 --> 04:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
right not the legislator not the
 
04:09:14.469 --> 04:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
government is there any other other
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions to this
 
04:09:19.870 --> 04:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.349 --> 04:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
trip uh thank you for taking my question
 
04:09:27.469 --> 04:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh the delay to receive Health Care in
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was
 
04:09:39.109 --> 04:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh causing a problem and that you
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
essentially had to go to Massachusetts
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
to get your health care could you please
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
tell me what kind of Health Care you
 
04:09:46.960 --> 04:09:48.550 align:start position:0%
tell me what kind of Health Care you
were

04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
getting I would prefer
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
not thank you uh I will just say that it
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
was a six-month weight in New Hampshire
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
and it was a two-month weight in
 
04:10:02.590 --> 04:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that was the difference
 
04:10:04.109 --> 04:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
that was that's a pretty significant
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
difference when you might be navigating
 
04:10:09.510 --> 04:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
surgery perhaps so yeah it was
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
significant other questions to this
 
04:10:15.790 --> 04:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time I
 
04:10:20.030 --> 04:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate thank you uh Liz Canada
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
please and I I again I'm I'm trying to
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
be mindful of the time I'm going to ask
 
04:10:28.990 --> 04:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
you the the following the witnesses to
 
04:10:30.910 --> 04:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
please try to limit your testimony to 3
 
04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
minutes if you would please we'll do
 
04:10:34.750 --> 04:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman so again
 
04:10:36.670 --> 04:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Liz Canada I'm
 
04:10:37.870 --> 04:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
the advocacy director director for
 
04:10:39.309 --> 04:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood New Hampshire action
 
04:10:41.109 --> 04:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
fund Planned Parenthood of Northern New
 
04:10:43.149 --> 04:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
England we're in strong opposition to
 
04:10:45.550 --> 04:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1248 it's a complete ban on
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire 15 days which
 
04:10:51.429 --> 04:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
is the subject of this bill is before
 
04:10:53.429 --> 04:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
almost anyone could even know they are
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant and before pregnancy tests are
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
even accurate so I want to use my time
 
04:11:00.670 --> 04:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll keep it within my two minutes I
 
04:11:03.950 --> 04:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
promise to explain how pregnancy works
 
04:11:05.790 --> 04:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
as a reminder to this committee
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is counted from the first day
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
of your period so day one is the first
 
04:11:16.469 --> 04:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
day of your period around day 8 or 9
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
after your period has ended it is
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
possible to get
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant around day 14 is ovulation when
 
04:11:29.309 --> 04:11:29.319 align:start position:0%
a person is most likely to get pregnant
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
within 24 to 48 hours of ovulation a
 
04:11:36.670 --> 04:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
sperm can fertilize an egg and then the
 
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
egg needs to to be implanted into the
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
uterus and now in this timeline that
 
04:11:44.910 --> 04:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
I've just given you we are either at or
 
04:11:48.070 --> 04:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
after day 15 which is what this bill is
 
04:11:51.630 --> 04:11:51.640 align:start position:0%
about and when abortion would be banned
 
04:11:53.950 --> 04:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is absolutely outrageous it's
 
04:11:55.229 --> 04:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
one of the most restrictive abortion
 
04:11:57.790 --> 04:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
bands in the country it would put us on
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
par with Texas and Arkansas and Alabama
 
04:12:02.469 --> 04:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
and these other states where women and
 
04:12:04.349 --> 04:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
Pregnant patients are having to travel
 
04:12:05.950 --> 04:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
out of state out of their home state to
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
get the care that they need and under no
 
04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances should we in New Hampshire
 
04:12:11.670 --> 04:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
be trying to emulate what is happening
 
04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
in those other states so we urge you to
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
vote in expedient to legislate on House
 
04:12:18.389 --> 04:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 1248 thank you thank you questions
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%

thank you so much for uh your time
 
04:12:57.790 --> 04:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony in strong
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
opposition to hp1
 
04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
1248 uh my name is Courtney Reid I am
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
policy Advocate at the ACLU of New
 
04:13:07.870 --> 04:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I will keep it brief for
 
04:13:09.950 --> 04:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
you as you uh have gotten a copy of my
 
04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
written testimony um what this bill does
 
04:13:16.510 --> 04:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh is essentially an allout abortion ban
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
04:13:21.469 --> 04:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Banning people from making
 
04:13:23.950 --> 04:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
a decision about their Healthcare before
 
04:13:25.630 --> 04:13:25.640 align:start position:0%
they would even know that they're
 
04:13:29.149 --> 04:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
pregnant um decisions like this don't
 
04:13:33.550 --> 04:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
only infringe on the right to privacy
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
and undermine uh individual's autonomy
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
and making private decisions about um
 
04:13:41.870 --> 04:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
the trajectory of their life course but
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
they also have um and what you've heard
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
in previous testimony um really damaging
 
04:13:49.309 --> 04:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
consequences um when we've seen other
 
04:13:54.269 --> 04:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
abortion bans in some states for example
 
04:13:57.710 --> 04:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
a six- we ban in Texas there have been
 
04:13:57.720 --> 04:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
a six- we ban in Texas there have been
um

04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:01.349 --> 04:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
correlating uh effects in public health
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
for example like I mentioned in Texas an
 
04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
11.5% increase in deaths since the onset
 
04:14:11.710 --> 04:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
of the D of the ban with experts
 
04:14:13.830 --> 04:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
agreeing that the legislation has
 
04:14:16.870 --> 04:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
increased health risks for both babies
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
and mothers Granite Staters need access
 
04:14:23.309 --> 04:14:23.319 align:start position:0%
to reproductive care um and this bill
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
would make it nearly impossible for them
 
04:14:28.349 --> 04:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
to access it in the state I urge members
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
of the committee to vote decisively
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
against this Bill thank you thank you
 
04:14:35.670 --> 04:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
witness say thank you very much next uh
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:47.910 --> 04:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
pritzer is that right is there another
 
04:14:51.790 --> 04:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
Beverly from Lowden yeah yep all right I
 
04:14:54.510 --> 04:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
would rather not be filmed do I have
 
04:14:56.189 --> 04:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
that option not to be filmed maybe I
 
04:15:00.750 --> 04:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:04.349 --> 04:15:04.359 align:start position:0%
um I just concur with uh the testimony
 
04:15:08.189 --> 04:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
of uh Heather Stockwell uh
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of what she had to say I could
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
definitely relate to but uh what I have
 
04:15:13.750 --> 04:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
here is just what I could pick out from
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
the bill itself the first thing I picked
 
04:15:17.830 --> 04:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
out was that it starts with in the year
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
of Our Lord which infers that a person
 
04:15:22.349 --> 04:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
has to believe in the Lord in order to
 
04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
comply with the law um I hope I have
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
time to read through this I'll try to
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
read it as quickly as possible because
 
04:15:31.070 --> 04:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
really the Crux of it is at the end but
 
04:15:33.269 --> 04:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with the biology of
 
04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
women and therefore it belongs to the
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services committee
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
to have it with the judicial Judiciary
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
Committee goes against the First
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the United States
 
04:15:45.910 --> 04:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution the Congress shall make no
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
law respecting establishment of religion
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
and honestly every argument in favor of
 
04:15:56.510 --> 04:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
of uh the pro-life deals with life
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
starts at conception because uh I don't
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
exactly understand why we had testimony
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
here about pregnancies and and and how
 
04:16:08.469 --> 04:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
pregnancies work can um I'm going to
 
04:16:10.670 --> 04:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
just move on to the second the second is
 
04:16:13.229 --> 04:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
the paragraph shall be construed to
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
require the performance of an ultra
 
04:16:17.109 --> 04:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
sound only if the provider either knows
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
that the fetus has a gastation agent can
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
I just ask you to get a little closer to
 
04:16:21.790 --> 04:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
the microphone I think we're having some
 
04:16:24.389 --> 04:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
trouble it appears it appears okay there
 
04:16:26.910 --> 04:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
are 22 weeks
 
04:16:30.630 --> 04:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
or4 days between 15 days and 24 weeks
 
04:16:34.269 --> 04:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
even I know that and I'm I'm not a
 
04:16:37.590 --> 04:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
medical professional it appears to be
 
04:16:39.550 --> 04:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill contains absolutely no
 
04:16:42.550 --> 04:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
measure of compromise to the status of
 
04:16:46.030 --> 04:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
the current legal terms for abortion
 
04:16:49.550 --> 04:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
while 24 weeks may be a little too long
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
too close to viability 15 days is too
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
far from it in fact research shows that
 
04:16:57.149 --> 04:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
most women are not aware that they have
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
missed a period or can even have a
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
period and have conceived and not know
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
it this is especially true of women who
 
04:17:06.119 --> 04:17:07.309 align:start position:0%
it this is especially true of women who
work

04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
women who are working miss a period
 
04:17:11.670 --> 04:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
could easily attribute it to stress
 
04:17:14.189 --> 04:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
which is a major contributor to a
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
woman's regularity and I do have uh I'm
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to give you these the research
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
that I found on about that it would be
 
04:17:23.550 --> 04:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of all men and
 
04:17:26.109 --> 04:17:26.119 align:start position:0%
women if distinctions of when to call
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
abortion a crime were left up to the
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
professionals who understand the nature
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
of these subtle biological nuances this
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
was the entire purpose of Row versus
 
04:17:37.750 --> 04:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
Wade to give the authority to the
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
distinctions of whether a fetus was
 
04:17:42.349 --> 04:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
viable or if the mother's life was in
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
danger to the medical professionals
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
leaving these decisions up to law
 
04:17:48.670 --> 04:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement is
 
04:17:52.590 --> 04:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
Impractical it totally infringes on the
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
privacy of even the union between a man
 
04:17:57.590 --> 04:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
and a
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
woman it is even stated in our New
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitutional Bill of Rights
 
04:18:06.269 --> 04:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
under the Article 2 Section B right of
 
04:18:06.279 --> 04:18:07.550 align:start position:0%
under the Article 2 Section B right of
privacy

04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
an individual's right to live free from
 
04:18:13.830 --> 04:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion and private or
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
04:18:17.790 --> 04:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
essential and
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
inherent the fact that this bill is
 
04:18:23.229 --> 04:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
founded on the religious belief that God
 
04:18:26.030 --> 04:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
creates life is kind of a fantasy in my
 
04:18:28.590 --> 04:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
opinion because what creates life is the
 
04:18:30.910 --> 04:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
joining of an egg and a sperm from two
 
04:18:33.950 --> 04:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
consenting adults God does not tell
 
04:18:37.149 --> 04:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
people when to conceive when to even
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
have sex the premise that you would ban
 
04:18:43.990 --> 04:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
abortion is the premise that that you
 
04:18:48.910 --> 04:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
would have people performing sexual acts
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
only when they intend to have children
 
04:18:56.910 --> 04:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
and that is totally not
 
04:18:59.149 --> 04:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
realistic life does not start at
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
fertilization we've had that already
 
04:19:03.870 --> 04:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
life is completely dependent on the
 
04:19:08.349 --> 04:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
woman for it to achieve success outside
 
04:19:12.309 --> 04:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
the body not the Judiciary Committee a
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
woman has religious freedom she can
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
choose whether or not to believe in God
 
04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
she can choose to believe in God and get
 
04:19:23.229 --> 04:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
an abortion she even if she believes in
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
God or she can believe in something or
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
nothing because we have freedom of
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
religion it doesn't matter because she
 
04:19:31.630 --> 04:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
has the choice to pick her own beliefs
 
04:19:33.790 --> 04:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
according to the US Constitution and the
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution it's not the
 
04:19:35.920 --> 04:19:37.269 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution it's not the
Judiciary

04:19:37.269 --> 04:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
Judiciary
 
04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee's decision for that if a fetus
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
could survive outside a woman's body
 
04:19:45.630 --> 04:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
then she would not be human and that's
 
04:19:48.550 --> 04:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
where you're taking this because women
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
are going to abstain from reproduction
 
04:19:56.109 --> 04:19:56.119 align:start position:0%
if you start putting these kind of rules
 
04:19:58.990 --> 04:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
on them uh I am a woman and I'm a human
 
04:20:01.109 --> 04:20:01.119 align:start position:0%
and I believe in God God has save my
 
04:20:04.109 --> 04:20:04.119 align:start position:0%
life and he will save the lives of many
 
04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
women and many babies in into the
 
04:20:11.189 --> 04:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
future it's a very small percentage of
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
women that are seeking abortions up to
 
04:20:13.920 --> 04:20:15.109 align:start position:0%
women that are seeking abortions up to
full

04:20:15.109 --> 04:20:15.119 align:start position:0%
full
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
term as somebody previously stated New
 
04:20:22.590 --> 04:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire abortion service centers have
 
04:20:26.910 --> 04:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions already up to like 11 weeks
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
so this bill whoever introduced it was
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
really crossing the
 
04:20:35.710 --> 04:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
boundaries of what is reasonable to
 
04:20:35.720 --> 04:20:37.510 align:start position:0%
boundaries of what is reasonable to
expect

04:20:37.510 --> 04:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
expect
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
um I believe that women can I ask you to
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh to summarize I've got one more
 
04:20:44.910 --> 04:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph I believe that women are
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
divinely designed to determine whether
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
they can sustain another life or
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
not women who give birth to life every
 
04:20:59.229 --> 04:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
day all over the world deserve to
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
maintain the respect and the reverence
 
04:21:06.070 --> 04:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
for the sacrifices that they make to
 
04:21:10.109 --> 04:21:10.119 align:start position:0%
keep humans in this world we do not have
 
04:21:14.030 --> 04:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
a shortage of humans in this world this
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to respect women's
 
04:21:18.590 --> 04:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
right to decide for themselves and thank
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
you for my listening to my testim thank
 
04:21:22.710 --> 04:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
you questions to this
 
04:21:25.710 --> 04:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
witness I taking questions you all right
 
04:21:27.149 --> 04:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
winess does not want to take questions
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.439 --> 04:21:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
please

04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
hello there thanks for letting me speak
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
um my name is Dr Maris toand I'm an
 
04:21:44.109 --> 04:21:44.119 align:start position:0%
obstetrician gynecologist in Southern
 
04:21:46.349 --> 04:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh I think we've already
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony I'm going to
 
04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
try not to repeat anything that's
 
04:21:53.790 --> 04:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
already been said um this is the most
 
04:21:55.870 --> 04:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
restrictive ban it's more restrictive
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
than the ban in Texas um we know that
 
04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
bans of this nature are very um have
 
04:22:08.070 --> 04:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
poor consequences for the patients in
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.550 --> 04:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
um sorry I'm not as eloquent as usual
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
today I worked last
 
04:22:19.710 --> 04:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
night um so just to clarify a little bit
 
04:22:21.510 --> 04:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
about the physiology of a menstrual
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
period I agree with what people have
 
04:22:26.510 --> 04:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
said 15 days um is around the time that
 
04:22:28.510 --> 04:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
Aver on average people will ovulate some
 
04:22:30.990 --> 04:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
people ovulate after that so really at
 
04:22:33.670 --> 04:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
this ban a decent percentage of um
 
04:22:35.429 --> 04:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
people would not actually even be
 
04:22:35.439 --> 04:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
people would not actually even be
pregnant

04:22:36.870 --> 04:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
04:22:39.309 --> 04:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
um so it would be impossible to perform
 
04:22:40.990 --> 04:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
an abortion it also would be impossible
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
to tell if a patient is pregnant roughly
 
04:22:46.269 --> 04:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
30 days is the very soonest that you can
 
04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
tell a patient is pregnant based on a um
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
hormone test either through the urine or
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
blood um through an ultrasound you know
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
the earliest you can see something is
 
04:22:58.830 --> 04:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
about five weeks sometimes six weeks uh
 
04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
so you know really this doesn't make any
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
sense when it comes to um reproductive
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:07.910 align:start position:0%
sense when it comes to um reproductive
physiology

04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
physiology
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
in the grand scheme of things um you
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
know I I I think that we have great data
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
and has been very well eloquently put
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
today to show um the negative
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
ramifications of having very restrictive
 
04:23:21.109 --> 04:23:21.119 align:start position:0%
abortion banss and that's not just on
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
patients that's also on your healthc
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
care provider um uh population um this
 
04:23:29.070 --> 04:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
would push Healthcare Providers out of
 
04:23:31.870 --> 04:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
the state it would also severely limit
 
04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
the ability of healthcare providers in
 
04:23:36.510 --> 04:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
the state to provide safe accessible
 
04:23:39.149 --> 04:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
care in many situations we know that
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
abortion is an evidence-based essential
 
04:23:43.990 --> 04:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
component of reproductive Health Care um
 
04:23:47.910 --> 04:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
and to not have that option um puts
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
patients at significant risk thank you
 
04:23:54.389 --> 04:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:59.070 --> 04:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
witness see none thank you uh next uh
 
04:24:02.910 --> 04:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.349 --> 04:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
please good morning thank you for
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
letting me speak here
 
04:24:10.389 --> 04:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
um got a couple things I strongly oppose
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh this bill I believe a woman really
 
04:24:14.670 --> 04:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be able to make her own
 
04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
decision with assistance from her
 
04:24:20.990 --> 04:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
physician uh to push this to 15 days is
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
crazy as as it's been said multiple
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
times 15 days you don't even know you're
 
04:24:27.910 --> 04:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant much less have enough time at
 
04:24:30.630 --> 04:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
that point to really think about what to
 
04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
do get a doctor's appointment to go
 
04:24:35.550 --> 04:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
forward one way or the other so 15 days
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
is just absolutely crazy um the other
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
thing I noticed in this bill there's no
 
04:24:44.910 --> 04:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
exceptions for rape or anything to that
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
effect um you know you we've seen what's
 
04:24:51.070 --> 04:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
happened in other states here that's uh
 
04:24:53.710 --> 04:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
passed abortion bills and all the people
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
are have to go out of state if they have
 
04:24:58.670 --> 04:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
the means or they have to have a a child
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
that they can't take care of
 
04:25:04.109 --> 04:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
um you know it that's should it just
 
04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be uh it needs to be the
 
04:25:08.070 --> 04:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
person the woman really needs to be able
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
to make her decision as to what she can
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
do when she can do it um you know until
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
the abortion is ingrained in the
 
04:25:18.790 --> 04:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution this is just going to keep
 
04:25:21.950 --> 04:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
going on and on with these bills uh this
 
04:25:24.189 --> 04:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
morning's Bill trying to change the
 
04:25:26.590 --> 04:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution I support that it really
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
that's the direction we need to be going
 
04:25:31.750 --> 04:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh not individual little bills that keep
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
changing with every time the legislature
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
changes um I will not talk my wife is
 
04:25:38.670 --> 04:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
going to talk so I won't talk her
 
04:25:42.429 --> 04:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
specific abortion or her specific uh
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy but you know leaving putting
 
04:25:48.990 --> 04:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill you can only have an
 
04:25:52.349 --> 04:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
abortion if the doctor says so uh we've
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
seen what's happened uh in Texas as an
 
04:25:57.109 --> 04:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
example where someone needed a medical
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
induced abortion to save the woman's
 
04:26:01.189 --> 04:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
life and she couldn't get it she was
 
04:26:02.790 --> 04:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
struggling to get it she finally had to
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
leave the state of Texas to get it uh
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
when you suddenly start getting lawyers
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
involved in that you're going to be in
 
04:26:12.269 --> 04:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
trouble and someone's you know you're
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
going to have women die or severely get
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
restricted because you put these bans in
 
04:26:20.790 --> 04:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
there and restrictions in there that
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
they're afraid you know doctors are
 
04:26:24.030 --> 04:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
afraid to do anything because they're
 
04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
going to potentially lose their license
 
04:26:29.790 --> 04:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
get fined get thrown in jail it's just
 
04:26:32.590 --> 04:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
unacceptable so I'll leave it at that
 
04:26:34.349 --> 04:26:34.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you questions
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
04:26:40.830 --> 04:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir uh next uh
 
04:26:43.469 --> 04:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
Aaron joerger
 
04:26:45.550 --> 04:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
chairman got it right this time and
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm here to
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
voice my strong opposition to hp1 1248 I
 
04:26:56.710 --> 04:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
strongly believe that decisions
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
regarding abortion should be solely left
 
04:27:01.309 --> 04:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
to a pregnant person and her physician
 
04:27:04.030 --> 04:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
this personal medical decision should
 
04:27:07.229 --> 04:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
not be legislated I was fortunate to
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
have a healthy full-term pregnancy
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
however that was not guaranteed I had a
 
04:27:15.109 --> 04:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
high risk for atopic
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy I didn't know that I was
 
04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
pregnant by 15 days and considering what
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen happen in other states with
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
very restrictive laws I may very well
 
04:27:30.830 --> 04:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
have died if I if my pregnancy was a
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
topic even though the this particular
 
04:27:36.269 --> 04:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
Bill allows exceptions for medical eerc
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
mercies we see doctors in other states
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
are delaying those procedures because
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
they're concern rightfully so for
 
04:27:48.309 --> 04:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
criminal charges against them um we
 
04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
can't allow this to happen in New
 
04:27:54.550 --> 04:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire instead I support cacr 23 to
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
ingrain abor abortion rights in New
 
04:27:56.880 --> 04:27:59.750 align:start position:0%
ingrain abor abortion rights in New
Hampshire

04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution I'd also like to challenge
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
the statement that pregnancy is only a
 
04:28:07.830 --> 04:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
joy and not a burden or a disability
 
04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
being someone who has actually gone
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
through pregnancy I can tell you that
 
04:28:16.109 --> 04:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
even the easiest of pregnancies is a
 
04:28:18.510 --> 04:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
great burden on a woman's body as well
 
04:28:21.710 --> 04:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
as her time the time from work required
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
for medical appointments and for illness
 
04:28:27.950 --> 04:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
often caused by pregnancy is Extreme I
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
was very fortunate that I had a job that
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
allowed me to take that time many women
 
04:28:36.309 --> 04:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
don't they have to choose but between
 
04:28:38.910 --> 04:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and having a job to support
 
04:28:41.910 --> 04:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
themselves and their family so I will
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
say pregnancy can be both a joy and a
 
04:28:47.309 --> 04:28:47.319 align:start position:0%
burden at the same
 
04:28:49.630 --> 04:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
time I won't be here for the next
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
hearing for hp1 1541 but I'd like to
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
voice my opposition to that as well and
 
04:28:59.429 --> 04:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
again urge you to support CAC
 
04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
c23 lastly I'm going to leave with a
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
statement I believe that if men were the
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
ones that were able ble to get pregnant
 
04:29:08.670 --> 04:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be having this debate right
 
04:29:10.950 --> 04:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
now thank you thank you very much
 
04:29:14.510 --> 04:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:16.269 --> 04:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
witness thank
 
04:29:19.630 --> 04:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
you right and uh I'm going to call next
 
04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
please bear with me I'm a little nervous
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
this is my first testimony uh good good
 
04:29:32.389 --> 04:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon judicial Community my name is
 
04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
Nicholas Patrick and I'm an independent
 
04:29:35.910 --> 04:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
from Dublin New Hampshire I'm I'm here
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
to oppose House Bill 1248 I want to
 
04:29:40.630 --> 04:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
first off by starting to poke some holes
 
04:29:42.429 --> 04:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
in this bill this bill is to ban
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
abortion this has already been talked
 
04:29:45.109 --> 04:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
about so I'll skip a little bit over
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
this but it should be called exactly
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
what it is a governmental Outreach on
 
04:29:51.510 --> 04:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
individuals Reproductive Rights if you
 
04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
look at Clause 2 and three of this bill
 
04:29:55.950 --> 04:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
line 17 through 27 this bill does not
 
04:29:58.109 --> 04:29:58.119 align:start position:0%
include instances of rape a woman should
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
not have the burden of raising a child
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
that was not her choice nor in any way
 
04:30:01.840 --> 04:30:02.710 align:start position:0%
that was not her choice nor in any way
her

04:30:02.710 --> 04:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:30:04.990 --> 04:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
fault and I hope Representatives who
 
04:30:06.670 --> 04:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
have impressed experience in the medical
 
04:30:09.109 --> 04:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
field both administratively and handson
 
04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
would believe and understand the
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
enormous burden that rape victims and
 
04:30:13.750 --> 04:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
survivors already have to go through
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
physically mentally and financially and
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
having to raise a child entirely by
 
04:30:19.710 --> 04:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
yourself isn't something the state
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
should be allowed or forced upon
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
anybody especially victims the state has
 
04:30:27.070 --> 04:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
completely failed to protect and very
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
rarely bring Justice to secondly this
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't allow abortion for minors
 
04:30:34.510 --> 04:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
many Republicans and even Democrats
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
stated earlier this week that a child is
 
04:30:38.109 --> 04:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
incapable of making life-altering or
 
04:30:40.309 --> 04:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
long-term decisions however forcing a
 
04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
child to have a baby wholly violates
 
04:30:42.359 --> 04:30:43.790 align:start position:0%
child to have a baby wholly violates
that

04:30:43.790 --> 04:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
concept many of you have worked on
 
04:30:47.750 --> 04:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
school boards and in
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
education and our parents and
 
04:30:51.149 --> 04:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
grandparents of talented children and
 
04:30:53.229 --> 04:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and understand that young
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
teenagers do not have the proper
 
04:30:57.269 --> 04:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
maturity to properly raise a
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
child nor should they have no choice but
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
to take on such a monstrous and
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous task due to the
 
04:31:04.560 --> 04:31:06.229 align:start position:0%
tremendous task due to the
state

04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:31:08.229 --> 04:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
however most importantly it goes against
 
04:31:10.389 --> 04:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
everything our state represents Live
 
04:31:13.269 --> 04:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
Free or Die Give me liberty or give me
 
04:31:15.349 --> 04:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
death that's something that I as well as
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
you have probably been taught from a
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
very young age a modotto that has guided
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
our state's politics and policies since
 
04:31:24.109 --> 04:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
it's Inception and this ban isn't as
 
04:31:26.349 --> 04:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
simple as if there should be abortion or
 
04:31:28.990 --> 04:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
not abortion it goes so much deeper than
 
04:31:31.349 --> 04:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
that it's an outof touch government
 
04:31:33.030 --> 04:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
imposing its ideals and controlling the
 
04:31:33.040 --> 04:31:34.389 align:start position:0%
imposing its ideals and controlling the
people's

04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
people's
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
Liberties and and controlling 60% of
 
04:31:39.109 --> 04:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
granite Staters according to 538 that
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to be restricted by the state
 
04:31:43.229 --> 04:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
in this manner and at 70% according to
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
WM are and I've had friends who have
 
04:31:48.389 --> 04:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
gotten abortions or the guys that were
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
the biological fathers and the biggest
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
lie that the opposition tells us is that
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's done without a heavy heart I'm here
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
telling you today that it absolutely is
 
04:31:59.950 --> 04:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
however my friends weren't robbed of
 
04:32:01.950 --> 04:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
their Liberties nor their
 
04:32:04.830 --> 04:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
potential one is in law school one is
 
04:32:07.149 --> 04:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
graduating Med and one is working as a
 
04:32:07.159 --> 04:32:08.790 align:start position:0%
graduating Med and one is working as a
child

04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:32:10.870 --> 04:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
psychologist and I understand as a
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
political science student myself that we
 
04:32:14.590 --> 04:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
have to pick a party in order to
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
maintain and get office however first
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
and foremost you made an oath to this
 
04:32:21.910 --> 04:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
office you made an oath to us the
 
04:32:24.109 --> 04:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
granite Staters and you made an oath to
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
this state and this state says it is not
 
04:32:28.469 --> 04:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
your choice to make thank you and I'm
 
04:32:29.790 --> 04:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you may
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much sir questions
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:34.439 --> 04:32:36.630 align:start position:0%
 
Witness

04:32:36.630 --> 04:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no seeing none thank you all
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
right that was the last uh card I have
 
04:32:46.710 --> 04:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
on uh hb1 1248 is there anyone else here
 
04:32:50.910 --> 04:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
who desires to testify on hb1
 
04:32:54.510 --> 04:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
1248 all right uh seeing none with that
 
04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the hearing and I
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
think we're maybe a minute or two early
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
to start the hearing on the next bill so
 
04:33:00.359 --> 04:33:04.349 align:start position:0%
to start the hearing on the next bill so
we'll

04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.359 --> 04:35:18.750 align:start position:0%
 
take

04:35:18.750 --> 04:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.510 --> 04:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
can be looked at as sort of a compromise
 
04:35:23.551 --> 04:35:23.561 align:start position:0%
and I hate to think about it that way
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
because I frankly wouldn't allow
 
04:35:29.070 --> 04:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
abortions if I was given a choice but
 
04:35:31.150 --> 04:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
what it does it
 
04:35:35.629 --> 04:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
takes the 24 of 25 weeks that we have
 
04:35:38.230 --> 04:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
and moves it up to 15
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
weeks and after that it's pretty much
 
04:35:43.269 --> 04:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
the same except that knowing that
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some additional
 
04:35:49.230 --> 04:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
chance of medical uh conditions you know
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
it it provides some add additional
 
04:35:54.750 --> 04:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
Medical Care
 
04:35:58.590 --> 04:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh the problem with abortions at 15
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
weeks 15 days 14 weeks whatever the the
 
04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:08.561 align:start position:0%
time is isn't a problem of medical
 
04:36:10.750 --> 04:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
issues that we should be trying to
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
handle it's it's a situation a natural
 
04:36:19.269 --> 04:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
situation and it's it's not a a job for
 
04:36:22.750 --> 04:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh Planned Parenthood it's not a job for
 
04:36:27.349 --> 04:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
ACLU uh and it's it to me it's really
 
04:36:30.510 --> 04:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
sad that we have to come together and
 
04:36:32.510 --> 04:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
try to come up with some sort
 
04:36:37.629 --> 04:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
of involved or or crazy solution to
 
04:36:41.629 --> 04:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
Medical Care uh you whether it be a a
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
cicr which is really bad but
 
04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
it it's not really a medical issue per
 
04:36:56.269 --> 04:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
se it's an issue between a husband and a
 
04:37:00.029 --> 04:37:00.039 align:start position:0%
wife and a decision to make to have a
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
baby and get some medical care if you
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
need it uh or if you know maybe you
 
04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%

least 15 weeks so are you aware that
 
04:38:06.150 --> 04:38:06.160 align:start position:0%

opposition of HB
 
04:38:47.109 --> 04:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
1541 I'll limit my remarks to two
 
04:38:49.590 --> 04:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
overall points given the compelling
 
04:38:51.189 --> 04:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
testimony you will hear today from
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
providers and
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
Advocates first I'm here to relay an
 
04:38:58.390 --> 04:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
important constituent story for your
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
consideration an OBGYN and Dartmouth
 
04:39:03.310 --> 04:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock Medical Center physician and
 
04:39:05.109 --> 04:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
professor of geel School of Medicine who
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
lives in my district and is licensed to
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
practice in both Vermont and in New
 
04:39:12.670 --> 04:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has reported to me directly
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
that the attacks on his medical practice
 
04:39:17.470 --> 04:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are pushing him to stop
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
offering his Provider Services in New
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and move his clinical practice
 
04:39:23.789 --> 04:39:23.799 align:start position:0%
exclusively to
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
Vermont he feels that New Hampshire laws
 
04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
regulating abortion care like this
 
04:39:32.629 --> 04:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
arbitrary 15we ban in HB
 
04:39:35.310 --> 04:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
1541 are an intrusion upon his medical
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
decision-making which follow national
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
standards of care and an intrusion upon
 
04:39:41.628 --> 04:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
his professional
 
04:39:44.708 --> 04:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
expertise this law if passed will send
 
04:39:46.910 --> 04:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
another signal that New Hampshire does
 
04:39:50.350 --> 04:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
not trust its OBGYN Physicians and does
 
04:39:52.350 --> 04:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
not value their difficult and meaningful
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
work passage of this bill would take
 
04:39:57.550 --> 04:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
away vital access to abortion procedures
 
04:40:00.350 --> 04:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
that are a vital part of this doctor's
 
04:40:03.270 --> 04:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
work passage will cement the message
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is not serious
 
04:40:07.550 --> 04:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
about giving providers all the tools
 
04:40:10.270 --> 04:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
they need to best serve their patients
 
04:40:12.550 --> 04:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
this bill will be another depressing
 
04:40:15.310 --> 04:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
moral defeat in the many attacks upon
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
the profession causing our state's
 
04:40:20.110 --> 04:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
OBGYNs to lose further confidence in New
 
04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's legislators for putting
 
04:40:24.390 --> 04:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
politics ahead of people in their
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
healthcare for these reasons I hope you
 
04:40:28.430 --> 04:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
will oppose this
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
bill secondly I'm here on behalf of my
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
provider constituents and the maternally
 
04:40:35.150 --> 04:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
reproductive age individuals of my
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
district to express my deep
 
04:40:40.830 --> 04:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
disappointment that we even need to
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
expend this much Collective energy and
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
these resources to entertain a bill that
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
further restricts reproductive health
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
care for women without
 
04:40:51.948 --> 04:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
acknowledging without naming the true
 
04:40:54.030 --> 04:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination that pregnant individuals
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are facing due to these
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
ongoing political attacks the mere fact
 
04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
that we're not discussing the efficacy
 
04:41:03.550 --> 04:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
and the wisdom of restricting male
 
04:41:05.628 --> 04:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
reproductive Healthcare procedures when
 
04:41:08.590 --> 04:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
a man is 50% of the cause of all
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
pregnancies demonstrates the true
 
04:41:13.310 --> 04:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination against an injustice
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
thrust upon New Hampshire's
 
04:41:18.750 --> 04:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:20.670 --> 04:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrates first of all this is the
 
04:41:22.310 --> 04:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
point that really makes me fill with
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
rage attacks on women's health care but
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
not men's healthare is blatant
 
04:41:30.310 --> 04:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on race excuse me
 
04:41:33.470 --> 04:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
sex blatant discrimination based on sex
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
and it is a substantial government
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
interference of medical privacy but even
 
04:41:39.868 --> 04:41:39.878 align:start position:0%
though I'm filled with this rage about
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
these attacks on my constituent
 
04:41:44.350 --> 04:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
providers and potentially my own body is
 
04:41:46.110 --> 04:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm dedicated to climbing every
 
04:41:48.750 --> 04:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
proverbial Mountain to defeat bills like
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
hb1 1541 to ensure access to safe and
 
04:41:54.270 --> 04:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
effective reproductive Health Care
 
04:41:56.350 --> 04:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
procedures and for these Reasons I'm
 
04:41:58.150 --> 04:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to please
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
bipartisan vote uh to please vote
 
04:42:04.270 --> 04:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
bipartison Le to defeat hb1 1541 please
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
vote or in expedient to legislate thank
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
you questions for questions for this
 
04:42:13.230 --> 04:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Paige thank
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
question um I share your uh frustration
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
that the legislator is in the middle of
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
this uh personal issue and I think if I
 
04:42:25.310 --> 04:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
heard correctly when the bill was
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
introduced there was an expression that
 
04:42:33.390 --> 04:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
the um intent of the bill may have been
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
to um remove the government from from
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
this this decision-making process and
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
keep it within
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
the the mom and family and
 
04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
provider with that in mind would cacr 23
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
be a better vehicle to that goal than
 
04:42:57.360 --> 04:42:59.030 align:start position:0%
be a better vehicle to that goal than
this

04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:43:01.150 --> 04:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
bill um thank you for your question
 
04:43:03.750 --> 04:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative I think it's really an
 
04:43:06.030 --> 04:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
important question to be asking uh
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
especially amongst yourselves as members
 
04:43:09.190 --> 04:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee who will ultimately
 
04:43:12.270 --> 04:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
decide the fate of both of these bills
 
04:43:15.430 --> 04:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
um of course an affirmative
 
04:43:17.910 --> 04:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
um an affirmative display or
 
04:43:20.990 --> 04:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
codification of women's right pregnant
 
04:43:23.310 --> 04:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
people's right to reproductive Freedom
 
04:43:25.230 --> 04:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
um has a more positive connotation for
 
04:43:28.670 --> 04:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
sure um and it will hold a lot more
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
protections affirmatively it will fill
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
the void that is currently um in New
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law you know and missing from
 
04:43:38.110 --> 04:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
our books
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
um you know proposing statutory
 
04:43:43.750 --> 04:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
arbitrary weak band on women's
 
04:43:46.990 --> 04:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health um will bring a lot
 
04:43:48.750 --> 04:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
of negative connotation for a lot of
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
people who are affected personally by
 
04:43:54.910 --> 04:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
that um that codification so you know
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
whether we're talking about providers
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
being taken away tools that they need to
 
04:44:00.590 --> 04:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
do their job or we're talking about you
 
04:44:02.510 --> 04:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
know families and pregnant people who
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
are having those decisions taken away
 
04:44:07.030 --> 04:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
from them based on some arbitrary weak
 
04:44:09.868 --> 04:44:09.878 align:start position:0%
designation so um I think that's an
 
04:44:13.390 --> 04:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
important question I think um ultimately
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
I think many of us believe that you know
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
the natural progression of where we are
 
04:44:19.390 --> 04:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
discussing these bills from year to year
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
is going to lead us to ultimately a
 
04:44:23.150 --> 04:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional question of whether or
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
not this should be affirmatively written
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
and protected in our state's most you
 
04:44:32.110 --> 04:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
know highest law um but I think you know
 
04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
given the political will and the makeup
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
of the bodies that are before us at this
 
04:44:39.150 --> 04:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
time in our Chambers we have to be
 
04:44:40.910 --> 04:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
prepared for any step that we can take
 
04:44:42.470 --> 04:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
affirmatively towards the direction of
 
04:44:45.670 --> 04:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
protecting Women's Healthcare thanks
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you for
 
04:44:52.430 --> 04:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you feel better
 
04:44:53.470 --> 04:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
if it
 
04:44:58.030 --> 04:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
said if the wording went that um it was
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
only that they tried to save the
 
04:45:05.230 --> 04:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
baby if it was not a baby that was born
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
with a uh lifethreatening fetal anomaly
 
04:45:11.070 --> 04:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
that type of thing so thank you
 
04:45:13.868 --> 04:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
representative for the question um and I
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
just reject the premise um again going
 
04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
back to my remarks the mere fact that
 
04:45:19.868 --> 04:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
we're not discussing limiting other
 
04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
people's Healthcare but we're limiting
 
04:45:24.270 --> 04:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
women's healthare is the issue that I'm
 
04:45:26.910 --> 04:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
most upset about and that you know any
 
04:45:29.910 --> 04:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
phonetic changes that you may determine
 
04:45:32.830 --> 04:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
is more pable for your party to pass is
 
04:45:33.910 --> 04:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
not something that I'm willing to
 
04:45:35.910 --> 04:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
entertain anyway so we are not even
 
04:45:37.750 --> 04:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
coming close to
 
04:45:41.788 --> 04:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
that other yes representative
 
04:45:44.590 --> 04:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
trip thank you for asking answering my
 
04:45:47.708 --> 04:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
question uh it appears to me that the
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
conditions within this bill are only
 
04:45:54.310 --> 04:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
effective after 15 weeks do you read it
 
04:45:54.320 --> 04:45:55.390 align:start position:0%
effective after 15 weeks do you read it
that

04:45:55.390 --> 04:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:57.550 --> 04:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
way I'm
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I said it appears to me that the
 
04:46:04.030 --> 04:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
conditions within this bill are only in
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
a effect after
 
04:46:11.230 --> 04:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
a a gestation period of 15 weeks do you
 
04:46:13.350 --> 04:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
read it that way thank you for the
 
04:46:14.910 --> 04:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
question I have I don't have the
 
04:46:16.350 --> 04:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
language in front of me here so I
 
04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you an answer off the top
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
of my head but I'm happy to dig in and
 
04:46:22.990 --> 04:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
report back to you all right well thank
 
04:46:26.470 --> 04:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this
 
04:46:29.070 --> 04:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
witness see none I guess I just had one
 
04:46:30.590 --> 04:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
question I noticed you you made the
 
04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
point about the discrimination against
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
women uh that you know that you think
 
04:46:37.548 --> 04:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
this would impose and and you know at
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
least personally you might be right I
 
04:46:42.788 --> 04:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
guess I wonder on the other side of that
 
04:46:45.470 --> 04:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
um since it is the law that it's the
 
04:46:47.390 --> 04:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
woman's Choice whether to have an
 
04:46:50.390 --> 04:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
abortion or not would you agree that
 
04:46:52.990 --> 04:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
there that if the woman decides to have
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
an abortion over the objection of the
 
04:46:58.670 --> 04:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
father that the woman should be solely
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for support of the child and
 
04:47:02.750 --> 04:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
should not be able to impo impose a
 
04:47:04.990 --> 04:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
support obligation on the man so thank
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
you representative for the question I
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
believe those questions are outside the
 
04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
scope of the actual matter before us St
 
04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
at hand so I'm going to go ahead and
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
decline to respond given that you know
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're discussing and
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's not you know the substance of the
 
04:47:19.470 --> 04:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
bill at hand today thank you right any
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
other questions for this
 
04:47:29.190 --> 04:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%

again with you know it's the same thing
 
04:47:42.430 --> 04:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
just a different Bill uh it's not quite
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
the same thing let's put that way but I
 
04:47:46.628 --> 04:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
do want to point out a couple more
 
04:47:49.030 --> 04:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
things and I heard one thing said today
 
04:47:51.230 --> 04:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
about reproduction or Reproductive
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
Rights Reproductive Rights Reproductive
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
Rights you ever looked up the term what
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
reproductive right or reproduction means
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
means to reproduce all right I mean
 
04:48:03.230 --> 04:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about reproducing
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about killing
 
04:48:07.230 --> 04:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
terminating all right that's what we're
 
04:48:10.750 --> 04:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
truly talking about all right 15 days 15
 
04:48:14.070 --> 04:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
weeks putting in a cacr you're talking
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
about killing you're not talking about
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
reproducing or Reproductive Rights I
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
mean this is how they go and change the
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
terms of the words and stuff like that
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't
 
04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
happen one other note I'm going to point
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
out here is from the American

Care
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
all right in it it's being used for
 
04:48:38.310 --> 04:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
healthc care it's you know I'm going to
 
04:48:39.548 --> 04:48:39.558 align:start position:0%
give you the document you can look up
 
04:48:41.628 --> 04:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
all the facts for yourself 95% of the
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:48.910 --> 04:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare abortion exploits the woman
 
04:48:52.548 --> 04:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
and kills an innocent pre-born
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
life when caring for a pregnant woman
 
04:48:58.390 --> 04:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
Physicians are caring for two distinct
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
patients the woman and The Unborn
 
04:49:03.990 --> 04:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
Child I think that's enough said I mean
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
at this point here we know we might
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
Dicker over when life starts but I I can
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
I like to say I can prove it but
 
04:49:13.390 --> 04:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
scientifically they have proved it I
 
04:49:15.628 --> 04:49:15.638 align:start position:0%
don't have to prove it you know
 
04:49:18.110 --> 04:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
immediately from day one the cells not
 
04:49:20.548 --> 04:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
the blob it's not a blob it's not a
 
04:49:23.310 --> 04:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
growth it's not a tumor the cells start
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
to divide and the cells are already
 
04:49:27.030 --> 04:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
known the
 
04:49:29.948 --> 04:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
xxxy what they are at that moment this
 
04:49:32.030 --> 04:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
is something that's just not made up all
 
04:49:34.230 --> 04:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
right this is scientifically so we're
 
04:49:35.948 --> 04:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
not talking about reproduction we're
 
04:49:37.868 --> 04:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
talking about killing all right
 
04:49:40.990 --> 04:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
destroying terminating abortion that's
 
04:49:42.990 --> 04:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about thank you all
 
04:49:45.270 --> 04:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
right questions for this
 
04:49:47.788 --> 04:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
witness see none thank you very much sir
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:01.510 --> 04:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon members of the
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee um I will be brief I know has
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
been a long day my name is Kayla
 
04:50:06.910 --> 04:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
Montgomery I'm the vice president of
 
04:50:08.670 --> 04:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
public affairs for Planned Parenthood of
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
Northern New England and Planned
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
Parenthood New Hampshire action fund we
 
04:50:13.868 --> 04:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
are here in opposition today to House
 
04:50:13.878 --> 04:50:14.910 align:start position:0%
are here in opposition today to House
Bill

04:50:14.910 --> 04:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:50:18.190 --> 04:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
1541 this bill is a government overreach
 
04:50:20.510 --> 04:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
into the practice of safe legal Medical
 
04:50:23.070 --> 04:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
Care in New Hampshire and we POS it this
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
bill would prevent patients from
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
accessing abortion care from trusted
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
providers like Planned Parenthood after
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
15 weeks abortion is safe at every stage
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
of pregnancy with absolutely no
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
justification this bill would prohibit
 
04:50:40.030 --> 04:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
highly qualified and trained providers
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
like those at Planned Parenthood of
 
04:50:43.868 --> 04:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
Northern New England from offering care
 
04:50:47.868 --> 04:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
after 15 weeks now patients they seek
 
04:50:49.990 --> 04:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
this care uh at the stage of pregnancy
 
04:50:52.628 --> 04:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons including
 
04:50:54.430 --> 04:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
because they have been forced to delay
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
care in order to travel from ban States
 
04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
this bill disregards the best interest
 
04:51:01.708 --> 04:51:01.718 align:start position:0%
of patients by further limiting
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
availability of this time sensitive care
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
and creating even more barriers for
 
04:51:08.030 --> 04:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
pregnant people and their
 
04:51:10.548 --> 04:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
families additionally this bill impacts
 
04:51:12.830 --> 04:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
the way hospitals deliver their Care by
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
interfering with standard medical
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
practice and imposing burdens on
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary mandates any health care
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
provider will tell you every pregnancy
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
is different and circumstances can
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
change quickly throughout a pregnancy a
 
04:51:29.708 --> 04:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
person's health and their well-being not
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
political interference should guide
 
04:51:34.350 --> 04:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
important medical decisions and I also
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
want to note that this bill lacks
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
compassion for grieving families I'm not
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
going to get into that because you this
 
04:51:42.070 --> 04:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee heard a similar Bill like this
 
04:51:44.430 --> 04:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
just last year and this committee um
 
04:51:48.670 --> 04:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
voted to itl that bill so just in uh in
 
04:51:50.230 --> 04:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
closing this bill does nothing to
 
04:51:52.270 --> 04:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
protect Granite Staters health or safety
 
04:51:55.310 --> 04:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
and we appr uh we uh urge you to oppose
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
this bill happy to take questions
 
04:52:01.390 --> 04:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:04.270 --> 04:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
witness uh yes representative peret
 
04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions last
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
year in speaking to you um you stated to
 
04:52:11.150 --> 04:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
me that Planned Parenthood did not do
 
04:52:13.708 --> 04:52:13.718 align:start position:0%
abortions over 15 weeks and that has now
 
04:52:15.788 --> 04:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
increased I believe to 21 weeks I have a
 
04:52:17.628 --> 04:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
couple questions where did you send
 
04:52:20.190 --> 04:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
people to have abortions after where did
 
04:52:22.708 --> 04:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
you refer people to have abortions after
 
04:52:22.718 --> 04:52:24.868 align:start position:0%
you refer people to have abortions after
15

04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
15
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
weeks sure so um I appreciate the uh
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
question and I appreciate the question
 
04:52:32.110 --> 04:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
because it gives me an opportunity to
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
explain this committee what has really
 
04:52:36.548 --> 04:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
changed on the ground in the last year
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
so as this committee knows 18 months ago
 
04:52:42.548 --> 04:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
roie Wade fell that um created chaos in
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
this country so throughout the last 18
 
04:52:47.190 --> 04:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
months we've seen bans in different
 
04:52:49.788 --> 04:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
states right now as of today we're at I
 
04:52:52.270 --> 04:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
think 21 states have banned abortion a
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
year ago uh February 16th I believe it
 
04:52:58.750 --> 04:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
was I stood before this committee and I
 
04:53:00.548 --> 04:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
said that in Manchester we perform
 
04:53:02.910 --> 04:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
abortions to 15 weeks and that was true
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
at the time in the year we have seen
 
04:53:08.430 --> 04:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
more patients coming from out of state
 
04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing patients from across this
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
country who are coming from band States
 
04:53:15.788 --> 04:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
in order to get the care that they need
 
04:53:17.548 --> 04:53:17.558 align:start position:0%
we have been listening to patients we
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
have been hearing them and what we know
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
is that they have delays in care because
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
it takes them time to get to us so we
 
04:53:27.070 --> 04:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
have been able to expand access to care
 
04:53:29.788 --> 04:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
at Planned Parenthood over the last year
 
04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
in two ways the first is that we have
 
04:53:35.150 --> 04:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
added medication abortion at a third
 
04:53:37.788 --> 04:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
site in New Hampshire in Dairy so now we
 
04:53:39.788 --> 04:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
do medication abortion at three out of
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
four of our health centers and at the
 
04:53:44.750 --> 04:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester Health Center we did um move
 
04:53:47.788 --> 04:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
to 18 weeks um and we did that not
 
04:53:50.708 --> 04:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
overnight but in the last
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
year do you have a followup yes my
 
04:53:54.000 --> 04:53:56.350 align:start position:0%
year do you have a followup yes my
question

04:53:56.350 --> 04:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
was where do you refer or where did you
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
refer patients
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
to if if you were not performing them
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
after 15
 
04:54:10.110 --> 04:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
weeks sure so like I said now we now go
 
04:54:12.788 --> 04:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
to 18 weeks but we were referring people
 
04:54:16.590 --> 04:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
to other states or to Dartmouth or um
 
04:54:19.150 --> 04:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
other uh providers that perform abortion
 
04:54:20.708 --> 04:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
later in
 
04:54:23.470 --> 04:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy okay I called every clinic in
 
04:54:25.310 --> 04:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and none of
 
04:54:28.628 --> 04:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
them do it over 15 weeks six days so it
 
04:54:31.948 --> 04:54:31.958 align:start position:0%
must have been to Dartmouth then am I am
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
I well you know know I represent PL
 
04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and I'm telling you that we
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know within the last year we started
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
going to 18 weeks one more quick
 
04:54:42.030 --> 04:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
question yep is there a reason why you
 
04:54:44.830 --> 04:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
don't perform them to 24 weeks since
 
04:54:47.230 --> 04:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
that's what everybody seems yeah I mean
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
I so of course I'll remind this
 
04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
committee that abortion is safe and
 
04:54:57.150 --> 04:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
legal to 24 weeks um and uh it is well
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
known it is a well-known fact that
 
04:55:03.230 --> 04:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
abortion is uh perfectly safe throughout
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
the second trimester at outpatient um
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
facilities like Planned Parenthood is we
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
just aren't equipped to go to 24
 
04:55:15.430 --> 04:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
weeks uh it is legal but it is just U
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
more training more staff support and
 
04:55:19.150 --> 04:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
things like that so that's where we
 
04:55:21.230 --> 04:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at right now
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
representative cab I believe you have a
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
question any other questions for
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
this yes representative
 
04:55:31.990 --> 04:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
sted thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think I heard you
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
say that there was an increase of uh
 
04:55:40.510 --> 04:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
patients coming from out of state for
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
abortions and the New Hampshire that's
 
04:55:44.830 --> 04:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
correct sound is very difficult in here
 
04:55:47.628 --> 04:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
um I'd be curious to know what
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
percentage of total abortions are those
 
04:55:54.270 --> 04:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
out of Staters representative in in your
 
04:55:54.280 --> 04:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
out of Staters representative in in your
uh

04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:59.350 --> 04:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
operations thank you for that question
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the numbers off the top
 
04:56:03.590 --> 04:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
of my head of course but this is
 
04:56:05.270 --> 04:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
something that we are seeing everywhere
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
in all states where abortion is still
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
safe and legal we are seeing a real
 
04:56:13.070 --> 04:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
increase of patients from out of state
 
04:56:15.470 --> 04:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
in Northern New England we are not
 
04:56:18.190 --> 04:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
seeing patients from out of state in the
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
same way that states who are surrounded
 
04:56:24.030 --> 04:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
by other ban States might see so two
 
04:56:26.548 --> 04:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
examples of states that see a lot of
 
04:56:28.190 --> 04:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
people from out of state would be
 
04:56:30.868 --> 04:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
Colorado and Illinois because they have
 
04:56:33.350 --> 04:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
ban states around them here in Northern
 
04:56:35.470 --> 04:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
New England we of course do see patients
 
04:56:37.470 --> 04:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
from out of state people come to New
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a variety of reasons um
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's because they have family
 
04:56:45.708 --> 04:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
here and they want to be surrounded by a
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
support network when they come here so I
 
04:56:50.548 --> 04:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
would say the numbers are probably under
 
04:56:53.230 --> 04:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
10% of people who are coming from out of
 
04:56:56.310 --> 04:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
state but the reason that they're coming
 
04:56:58.150 --> 04:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
um is because they've been pushed out of
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
their home state for care and that
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
delays care when politicians ban
 
04:57:06.150 --> 04:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancy it delays the care for people
 
04:57:09.788 --> 04:57:09.798 align:start position:0%
thank you followup yes yes please I've
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
also heard that most abortions uh are
 
04:57:16.510 --> 04:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
done in the first
 
04:57:20.310 --> 04:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
trimester much fewer in the second Y and
 
04:57:23.150 --> 04:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
much much fewer in the
 
04:57:23.160 --> 04:57:25.470 align:start position:0%
much much fewer in the
third

04:57:25.470 --> 04:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
third
 
04:57:25.480 --> 04:57:27.590 align:start position:0%
third
um

04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:30.670 --> 04:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
what what percentage of numbers in in
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
the second trimester and would it make a
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
difference if it were 17 or 18 weeks in
 
04:57:41.390 --> 04:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
the bill instead of
 
04:57:44.750 --> 04:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
15 to answer the last question first I
 
04:57:46.628 --> 04:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
would say uh we don't support abortion
 
04:57:51.788 --> 04:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
banss period um yes abortion uh the
 
04:57:54.190 --> 04:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
first part of your question yes the vast
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
majority of abortions happen in the
 
04:57:58.190 --> 04:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
first trimester I believe the number is
 
04:57:58.200 --> 04:57:59.910 align:start position:0%
first trimester I believe the number is
92

04:57:59.910 --> 04:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
92
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
93% um medication abortion is
 
04:58:08.230 --> 04:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
um uh an option for people to end a
 
04:58:09.990 --> 04:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy early in pregnancy it's up to
 
04:58:12.670 --> 04:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
11 weeks um nationally that number is
 
04:58:14.190 --> 04:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
about 50% of people who choose
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
medication abortion over a procedural
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
abortion a PL Parenthood in Northern New
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
England that number is actually much
 
04:58:20.548 --> 04:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
higher it's actually
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
72% so the vast majority of abortion is
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
happening earlier but there's many
 
04:58:28.230 --> 04:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
reasons that someone might need an
 
04:58:30.070 --> 04:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
abortion later in pregnancy or into the
 
04:58:31.910 --> 04:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
second trimester for a variety of
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
reasons as I discussed
 
04:58:36.390 --> 04:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
other questions for this
 
04:58:39.110 --> 04:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
witness so I just I guess I just had one
 
04:58:40.708 --> 04:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
question if I'm understanding correctly
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
what what or am I understanding
 
04:58:46.948 --> 04:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
correctly that there's been because of
 
04:58:50.110 --> 04:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
of of uh the laws that have changed
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
since roie Wade was overruled and did I
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
understand correctly you were saying
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
that there has been sort of an increase
 
04:59:01.548 --> 04:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
in the call for uh abortion services in
 
04:59:06.110 --> 04:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
certainly there's people in New
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who also need abortion after
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
15 weeks we know that um but in addition
 
04:59:14.830 --> 04:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
we are seeing people from other states
 
04:59:16.750 --> 04:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
who are coming in okay and and and I
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
take it you've been able to accommodate
 
04:59:21.548 --> 04:59:21.558 align:start position:0%
that yes right uh is there any
 
04:59:24.030 --> 04:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
inconsistency between that what you've
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
just told us and this expressed fear of
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
people who have testified earlier that
 
04:59:34.030 --> 04:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know we're losing our ability
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
to uh to satisfy the needs of women
 
04:59:39.788 --> 04:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
because of these laws apparently you've
 
04:59:42.350 --> 04:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
been able to actually provide increased
 
04:59:45.470 --> 04:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
Services is that correct yeah I would
 
04:59:48.590 --> 04:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
say that the the fear is that this is
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
this is a really chaotic landscape
 
04:59:52.990 --> 04:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
because every day I mean all of you have
 
04:59:54.750 --> 04:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
read the headlines every day there's
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
something new out there there's
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
something confusing some things before
 
04:59:59.230 --> 04:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
The Supreme Court we now have two
 
05:00:00.910 --> 05:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
abortion cases before The Supreme Court
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
that will come out in June so I think
 
05:00:04.510 --> 05:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
the confusion is that no one's really
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
sure and um you know having something
 
05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
proactive on the books at Constitution
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment would help assure people of
 
05:00:12.628 --> 05:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
that and so right now people just it's
 
05:00:14.110 --> 05:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
confusing for people and when they hear
 
05:00:16.628 --> 05:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
there's a 15-day or a 15we ban it's just
 
05:00:19.390 --> 05:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's frankly confusing thank you uh
 
05:00:20.990 --> 05:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
other questions for this
 
05:00:24.270 --> 05:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:00:28.070 --> 05:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh Courtney uh uh
 
05:00:30.948 --> 05:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
breed I think that's right Reed I'm
 
05:00:34.590 --> 05:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
sorry Courtney Reed
 
05:00:41.830 --> 05:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you chair I'll try to get
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
better about my handwriting next time I
 
05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
have to fill out a pink card um thank
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
you all for listening to my testimony uh
 
05:00:54.390 --> 05:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
I am here with the ACLU New Hampshire in
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB
 
05:00:59.070 --> 05:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
1541 and that this bill would prevent
 
05:01:01.150 --> 05:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
doctors from exercising their best
 
05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
medical judgment when providing
 
05:01:05.948 --> 05:01:05.958 align:start position:0%
abortions after 15 weeks of gestation
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
moreover the bill would impose harmful
 
05:01:10.670 --> 05:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions on abortion care in New
 
05:01:13.030 --> 05:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are neither warranted nor
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
rooted in medical
 
05:01:18.110 --> 05:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
accuracy the requirement of abortions
 
05:01:21.190 --> 05:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
after 15 weeks to take place in hospital
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
settings as well as having a second
 
05:01:27.788 --> 05:01:27.798 align:start position:0%
physician on hand single out abortion to
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
burdensome regulations that are not
 
05:01:32.548 --> 05:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
reflected in other areas of Medical
 
05:01:32.558 --> 05:01:33.350 align:start position:0%
reflected in other areas of Medical
Practice

05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
Practice
 
05:01:37.310 --> 05:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
practice further the Bill's requirement
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
um would make it so Physicians are bound
 
05:01:42.708 --> 05:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
to what politicians are inserting that
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
they do rather than their training and
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
expertise and we know that Physicians
 
05:01:51.510 --> 05:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
are also Bound by medical ethics and
 
05:01:54.270 --> 05:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
that infanticide is already IL legal at
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
the federal level yet this bill makes it
 
05:01:59.190 --> 05:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
more difficult for them to exercise
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
their appropriate judgment in standards
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
of care and Compassionate Care
 
05:02:06.430 --> 05:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
during pregnancies or when people are
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
seeking legal abortions in New
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire moreover I just want to
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
underline that the bills uh subjecting
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
of providers to New Hampshire state laws
 
05:02:19.788 --> 05:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
governing homicide manslaughter and
 
05:02:21.788 --> 05:02:21.798 align:start position:0%
civil liability for wrongful death
 
05:02:21.798 --> 05:02:22.788 align:start position:0%
civil liability for wrongful death
medical

05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
medical
 
05:02:26.270 --> 05:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
malpractice will cause uh Physicians out
 
05:02:28.150 --> 05:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
of an abundance of caution for fear of
 
05:02:30.868 --> 05:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
these criminal penalties to limit care
 
05:02:34.510 --> 05:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
to pregnant people um they won't be able
 
05:02:36.670 --> 05:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
to exercise their medical judgment
 
05:02:39.788 --> 05:02:39.798 align:start position:0%
freely um because these criminal
 
05:02:42.030 --> 05:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
liabilities will cause them to act in a
 
05:02:45.788 --> 05:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
restraint way or for uh example uh with
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
the exceptions in the bill for pregnant
 
05:02:52.190 --> 05:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
individuals to demonstrate um clear
 
05:02:55.070 --> 05:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
illness to an undefined
 
05:02:58.548 --> 05:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
point uh and lastly I just wanted to
 
05:03:01.750 --> 05:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
note that um legislation like this has
 
05:03:03.390 --> 05:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
shown time and time again to be
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
unpopular with voters and so I would
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
urge that the committee vote um against
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
this bill and siding with individual
 
05:03:13.150 --> 05:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
freedom and the right to privacy um
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
rather than inserting themselves in what
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
should be private and independent
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
Healthcare decisions thank you and I'm
 
05:03:21.110 --> 05:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions thank you
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:26.910 --> 05:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Perez thank
 
05:03:28.590 --> 05:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking my
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
question does New Hampshire
 
05:03:31.680 --> 05:03:33.390 align:start position:0%
question does New Hampshire
limit

05:03:33.390 --> 05:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
limit
 
05:03:36.270 --> 05:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
who can have an abortion in New
 
05:03:40.030 --> 05:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does New Hampshire limit who
 
05:03:42.628 --> 05:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
has the right to an abortion what female
 
05:03:44.230 --> 05:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
has a right to the
 
05:03:46.830 --> 05:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire and the reason
 
05:03:50.990 --> 05:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
why I asked is that in your testimony
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
here that you have given out I was a
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
little taken back
 
05:03:57.868 --> 05:03:57.878 align:start position:0%
um that these burdens will
 
05:04:00.070 --> 05:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
disproportionately fall on women of
 
05:04:03.310 --> 05:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
colors who struggling to make ends young
 
05:04:05.350 --> 05:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
people immigrants people with
 
05:04:09.030 --> 05:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities and LGBT communities
 
05:04:12.190 --> 05:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
moreover abortion banss which we don't
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
have an abortion ban are also also
 
05:04:17.910 --> 05:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
anticipated to disproportionately
 
05:04:20.590 --> 05:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
produce negative health comes Health
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes for the bipac communities
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
research finds abortion is significantly
 
05:04:32.510 --> 05:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
safer than pregnancy for black and IND
 
05:04:32.520 --> 05:04:33.910 align:start position:0%
safer than pregnancy for black and IND
ous

05:04:33.910 --> 05:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
ous
 
05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
people I was not under the impression
 
05:04:39.230 --> 05:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
that there was anything in the New
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire laws that restricted abortion
 
05:04:46.830 --> 05:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
to anybody based on their ethnic
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
background their um their Identity or
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
anything but yet you're saying
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
that you're implying in this
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
05:05:01.480 --> 05:05:03.750 align:start position:0%
testimony that
um

05:05:03.750 --> 05:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
that we are and I just didn't know that
 
05:05:09.910 --> 05:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your question
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative um to start off with that
 
05:05:17.310 --> 05:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
I think that a lot of Reproductive
 
05:05:19.868 --> 05:05:19.878 align:start position:0%
Rights Advocates would assert that
 
05:05:22.670 --> 05:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
abortion rights is a racial justice
 
05:05:25.868 --> 05:05:25.878 align:start position:0%
issue what is a racial justice issue
 
05:05:30.350 --> 05:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
when bans happen we see desparate Health
 
05:05:32.470 --> 05:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
consequences fall on communities that
 
05:05:34.430 --> 05:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
are black and brown and that's been
 
05:05:37.230 --> 05:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrated through numerous research
 
05:05:40.230 --> 05:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
articles that I I cite in my um written
 
05:05:43.230 --> 05:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
hand out to you all for example um the
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
disparities um the racial disparities in
 
05:05:47.350 --> 05:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality rates that would
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
happen um should there be an allout ban
 
05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the United States um which is why
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's so important that the committee
 
05:05:57.110 --> 05:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
vote decisively against this bill um as
 
05:05:59.868 --> 05:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
to not exacerbate um racialized Health
 
05:06:02.110 --> 05:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
inequality that we're seeing across the
 
05:06:04.510 --> 05:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
country and and moreover there's a lot
 
05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
of research that cites that black and
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
brown communities in healthcare spaces
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
are uh more likely to be policed than
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
wealthy white patients um I believe the
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
study that I cited was coming from the
 
05:06:22.708 --> 05:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
uh Sunni School of Law human rights
 
05:06:24.628 --> 05:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
clinic in addition with a few other
 
05:06:26.830 --> 05:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
co-authors and I would love to pull out
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
some of the specic specific findings and
 
05:06:32.470 --> 05:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
concerns there that um had motivated um
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
my inclusion of that into my testimony
 
05:06:35.360 --> 05:06:36.270 align:start position:0%
my inclusion of that into my testimony
thank

05:06:36.270 --> 05:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:06:40.590 --> 05:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you but we're talking
 
05:06:43.590 --> 05:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire and this was all put
 
05:06:46.910 --> 05:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
under the cacr
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
23 offering rights my question was I do
 
05:06:54.110 --> 05:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
not believe if no matter who I am what
 
05:06:56.990 --> 05:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
color I am what my ethnic background is
 
05:06:59.830 --> 05:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
or what my identity is if I walked into
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
a Planned Parenthood they are going to
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
to tell me because of any of those
 
05:07:08.270 --> 05:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
things here in New Hampshire I cannot
 
05:07:09.470 --> 05:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
have an
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
abortion that's not happening here is
 
05:07:12.000 --> 05:07:13.350 align:start position:0%
abortion that's not happening here is
that

05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct there's nothing
 
05:07:19.350 --> 05:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
in state law that excludes uh the right
 
05:07:21.590 --> 05:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
to an abortion depending on someone's
 
05:07:24.990 --> 05:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
race or
 
05:07:27.270 --> 05:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
background other question yes uh
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative P quick question thanks
 
05:07:30.628 --> 05:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
for taking thanks Mr chair thanks for
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question is it possible
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
possible uh misre that when the
 
05:07:36.910 --> 05:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
legislature passes a law it could not
 
05:07:40.110 --> 05:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
intentionally impact a particular group
 
05:07:42.310 --> 05:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
um in a certain way but might
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
desparately impact a group just based on
 
05:07:48.670 --> 05:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
that uh group's access to health care or
 
05:07:50.910 --> 05:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
to Quality education or whatnot is it
 
05:07:54.868 --> 05:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
possible that that's is that possible
 
05:07:55.788 --> 05:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative and that's exactly what I
 
05:08:00.270 --> 05:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
was hoping to speak to in my response to
 
05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
the last question and should New
 
05:08:05.910 --> 05:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow along um you know in
 
05:08:07.470 --> 05:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
other states in the wrong direction I
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
think we are worried that this could
 
05:08:11.190 --> 05:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
make Health disparities at the national
 
05:08:15.070 --> 05:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
level um even broader thank
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness so
 
05:08:20.110 --> 05:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
I guess I just have one on you're
 
05:08:22.990 --> 05:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
talking about disparate impact and I
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering is um if the if the
 
05:08:29.230 --> 05:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
test that we rely on should be disparate
 
05:08:32.830 --> 05:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
impact I wonder if you could tell me any
 
05:08:35.948 --> 05:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
government regulation that that would
 
05:08:38.910 --> 05:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
not have a disparate impact in the way
 
05:08:40.350 --> 05:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I mean wouldn't
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
that be wouldn't it be that almost
 
05:08:45.750 --> 05:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
almost any government regulation of some
 
05:08:48.030 --> 05:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
kind or other would have a disparate
 
05:08:50.510 --> 05:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
impact on the people that you're talking
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
about yeah I think that's right that a
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
lot of legislation that passes has a
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
latent effect that would affect racial
 
05:09:00.750 --> 05:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
inequality but I do know that what we're
 
05:09:02.350 --> 05:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
seeing nationally is that when
 
05:09:04.708 --> 05:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
legislation like this is passed it has a
 
05:09:06.750 --> 05:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
negative effect that exacerbates
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
existing Public Health inequalities and
 
05:09:12.350 --> 05:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
so passing this bill would only move
 
05:09:14.910 --> 05:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
Health inequality across racialized
 
05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
lines in the wrong
 
05:09:20.708 --> 05:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
direction all right other questions Mr
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
CH yes represent lenzo thank you for
 
05:09:25.628 --> 05:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:09:27.948 --> 05:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at the bill and one
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that stands out to me is
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
that the procedure is listed in
 
05:09:39.350 --> 05:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
the in the um Bill requires two
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
positions attending the um the abortion
 
05:09:44.788 --> 05:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
I was wondering how that would impact um
 
05:09:46.548 --> 05:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
you know Health
 
05:09:49.548 --> 05:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
Care in the shortage of doctors and and
 
05:09:49.558 --> 05:09:50.788 align:start position:0%
Care in the shortage of doctors and and

Hampshire thank you so much for your
 
05:09:55.390 --> 05:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
question representative um I have a
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
better understanding of how the effect
 
05:10:02.110 --> 05:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
of a required hospital um presence would
 
05:10:03.310 --> 05:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
FF the bill and I know that that would
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
make it extremely hard or impossible for
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
clinics in New Hampshire to offer these
 
05:10:10.548 --> 05:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
services to patients but I would love to
 
05:10:12.750 --> 05:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
um perhaps have that question be asked
 
05:10:15.390 --> 05:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
to um a direct provider of abortion
 
05:10:17.788 --> 05:10:17.798 align:start position:0%

nurses attest that politics have no
 
05:11:33.548 --> 05:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
place in the proc procedure room it is
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
the belief of the equality Health Center
 
05:11:39.030 --> 05:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
that government overreach such as HB
 
05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
1541 intrudes and singles out clinics
 
05:11:44.670 --> 05:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
which provide abortion
 
05:11:48.190 --> 05:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
Services it communicates a mistrust of
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
and a lack of support for
 
05:11:53.788 --> 05:11:53.798 align:start position:0%
facilities that patients actively seek
 
05:11:56.670 --> 05:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
for their appropriate Health

in consultation with their doctor and
 
05:12:08.350 --> 05:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
not with the legislature which should be
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
which should only be concerned with the
 
05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
protection of our citizens rights to

05:13:01.110 --> 05:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
1541 this bill will interfere with
 
05:13:03.430 --> 05:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
compassionate care and force medical
 
05:13:05.788 --> 05:13:05.798 align:start position:0%
interventions that will not affect
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
survival I am a doctor a mother of two
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
living children and as I shared earlier
 
05:13:13.390 --> 05:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
I am a woman who had two abortions due
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
to complications during pregnancy with
 
05:13:17.910 --> 05:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
twins the first was due to uterine
 
05:13:20.430 --> 05:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
rupture the second abortion was due to a
 
05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
high risk of hemorrhage again and

miscarriage before viability born too
 
05:13:28.230 --> 05:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
early for medical interventions to save
 
05:13:28.240 --> 05:13:29.150 align:start position:0%
early for medical interventions to save
her

05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
her
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
life if it had been different and she
 
05:13:34.350 --> 05:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
would was born before viability then let
 
05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
me hold her let me love her let her feel
 
05:13:40.948 --> 05:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
my warmth and hear my voice let her
 
05:13:42.948 --> 05:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
father touch her skin and stroke her
 
05:13:45.628 --> 05:13:45.638 align:start position:0%
hair he never got to feel her kick from
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
the womb like I did do not force her
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
into an incubator and medical procedures
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
with lines and tubes and
 
05:13:56.910 --> 05:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
scalpel ventilators and monitors and
 
05:14:00.590 --> 05:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
sterile gloves let her time be with us
 
05:14:03.670 --> 05:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
her family and let us decide how that
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
time is spent let us build memories of
 
05:14:09.430 --> 05:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
loving her not watching her
 
05:14:12.990 --> 05:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
suffer families in complex unexpected
 
05:14:14.948 --> 05:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
and often heartbreaking situations like
 
05:14:20.788 --> 05:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:23.190 --> 05:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
options we should be able to make
 
05:14:25.230 --> 05:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions with our doctors
 
05:14:27.190 --> 05:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
including comfort care for babies who
 
05:14:30.190 --> 05:14:30.200 align:start position:0%
will not survive regardless of medical
 
05:14:32.430 --> 05:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
interventions as a mom
 
05:14:35.470 --> 05:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
this needs to be allowed this needs to
 
05:14:38.030 --> 05:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
be legal this is not an appropriate
 
05:14:40.350 --> 05:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
place for political interference these
 
05:14:42.750 --> 05:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
are impossible decisions to be made by
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
parents medical experts the people in
 
05:14:48.270 --> 05:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
that room with all due respect this is
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
not a decision for the people in a
 
05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislative committee room as a doctor I
 
05:14:56.270 --> 05:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
urge you do not force doctors to deny
 
05:14:58.910 --> 05:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
fam's Compassionate Care don't threaten
 
05:15:00.670 --> 05:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
them with years of imprisonment to do
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
something that goes against their best
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
medical judgment against all the facts
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
in front of them I ask you to consider
 
05:15:10.510 --> 05:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
the hypocritic oath which implores first
 
05:15:14.470 --> 05:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
Do no harm a state mandate for medical
 
05:15:16.750 --> 05:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
interventions that will not change
 
05:15:20.190 --> 05:15:20.200 align:start position:0%
survival outcomes is the definition of
 
05:15:22.990 --> 05:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
harm it denies families the opportunity
 
05:15:25.390 --> 05:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
to hold their babies before they pass
 
05:15:27.628 --> 05:15:27.638 align:start position:0%
and piles up unnecessary expensive
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
medical bills for futile
 
05:15:33.350 --> 05:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
care there are systems in place that
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
support families in these unimaginable
 
05:15:38.310 --> 05:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking situations do not create a
 
05:15:40.030 --> 05:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
system that makes this terrible time
 
05:15:42.590 --> 05:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
worse this bill does not give room for
 
05:15:42.600 --> 05:15:43.590 align:start position:0%
worse this bill does not give room for
paliative

05:15:43.590 --> 05:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
paliative
 
05:15:45.788 --> 05:15:45.798 align:start position:0%
care I'd also like to remind this
 
05:15:47.548 --> 05:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
committee that a similar bill was before
 
05:15:51.110 --> 05:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
you just last year HB 346 and this
 
05:15:53.430 --> 05:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
committee voted to defeat that bill by a
 
05:15:56.910 --> 05:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
vote of 18 to1 because the reality is
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
that no law can be written to thread the
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
needle of these complex situations
 
05:16:05.430 --> 05:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
please reject HB 1541 thank you thank
 
05:16:06.510 --> 05:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
you questions for this word
 
05:16:06.520 --> 05:16:07.670 align:start position:0%
you questions for this word
representative

05:16:07.670 --> 05:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:10.150 --> 05:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
K thank you Mr chairman and thank you Dr
 
05:16:12.350 --> 05:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
Zano for taking my question I appreciate
 
05:16:16.310 --> 05:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
it I wanted to ask you spoke a lot to
 
05:16:17.990 --> 05:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the line in the bill that's regarding
 
05:16:20.390 --> 05:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
the immediate care for a child born
 
05:16:22.510 --> 05:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
alive as a result of the
 
05:16:26.070 --> 05:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
abortion and since this would be um
 
05:16:29.190 --> 05:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
until viability which is now known would
 
05:16:32.430 --> 05:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
you agree is at 24 weeks
 
05:16:35.110 --> 05:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
um would this mean that any baby that
 
05:16:39.150 --> 05:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
was born before that perhaps for reasons
 
05:16:42.270 --> 05:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
that they do have anomalies that are
 
05:16:44.910 --> 05:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life that they would
 
05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
need to immediately be provided life
 
05:16:49.910 --> 05:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
sustaining care that could potentially
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
only prolong their life for hours or
 
05:16:56.030 --> 05:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
days as opposed to being in the arms of
 
05:16:59.430 --> 05:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:02.670 --> 05:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
time so I think I understand your
 
05:17:04.190 --> 05:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
question but I might have confused it in
 
05:17:07.470 --> 05:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
my head so this bill is confusing and
 
05:17:10.310 --> 05:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
conflating viability with 15 weeks that
 
05:17:14.670 --> 05:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
is months apart in time and not
 
05:17:14.680 --> 05:17:16.270 align:start position:0%
is months apart in time and not
medically

05:17:16.270 --> 05:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
medically
 
05:17:21.070 --> 05:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
accurate um viability is a moving Target
 
05:17:23.230 --> 05:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
as Medical Care
 
05:17:25.470 --> 05:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
advances and suggesting that you can
 
05:17:28.230 --> 05:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
interpose 15 weeks in viability is
 
05:17:30.750 --> 05:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
simply incorrect um I think there was a
 
05:17:33.390 --> 05:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
part of your question question regarding
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
could you just repeat that part yeah so
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
I was saying that wouldn't you agree
 
05:17:40.110 --> 05:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
that as of right now viability is
 
05:17:42.590 --> 05:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
accepted to be at 24 weeks and so as a
 
05:17:44.430 --> 05:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
result this bill although it says 15
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
weeks actually post uh fertilization so
 
05:17:50.310 --> 05:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
technically VI 17 weeks so from 17 weeks
 
05:17:52.990 --> 05:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
until 23 weeks and 6 days that these
 
05:17:54.670 --> 05:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
babies would be required to be taken
 
05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
from their parents and provided like uh
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
measures to prolong their life that even
 
05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
though they're not
 
05:18:04.750 --> 05:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
I do agree I think that it would take
 
05:18:07.590 --> 05:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for families
 
05:18:10.548 --> 05:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
to love their children and grieve their
 
05:18:14.708 --> 05:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
loss and instead separate them put these
 
05:18:14.718 --> 05:18:16.548 align:start position:0%
loss and instead separate them put these
fetuses

05:18:16.548 --> 05:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
fetuses
 
05:18:20.270 --> 05:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
in sterile and pain painful and
 
05:18:20.280 --> 05:18:21.590 align:start position:0%
in sterile and pain painful and
dangerous

05:18:21.590 --> 05:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
05:18:25.270 --> 05:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
positions are very unlikely to survive
 
05:18:25.280 --> 05:18:26.830 align:start position:0%
positions are very unlikely to survive
them

05:18:26.830 --> 05:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:18:26.840 --> 05:18:28.990 align:start position:0%
them

[Music]
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
creating situations that we can't
 
05:18:32.548 --> 05:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
understand understand as adults that
 
05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
we're putting
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:42.390 --> 05:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
small fetus baby it's a strange space
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's a nonviable pregnancy that was
 
05:18:48.708 --> 05:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
birthed right
 
05:18:48.718 --> 05:18:52.070 align:start position:0%
birthed right
um

05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
I through my training worked in NICU I
 
05:18:59.628 --> 05:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
trained with OBGYNs
 
05:19:01.990 --> 05:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
I I have seen what a lot of these
 
05:19:04.708 --> 05:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
infants have gone through
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
and there is
 
05:19:10.590 --> 05:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
a amazing care that can happen and still
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
have tragic outcomes so I don't think we
 
05:19:16.910 --> 05:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
should force that on
 
05:19:20.708 --> 05:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
anyone thank you questions for this
 
05:19:23.670 --> 05:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
goodness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:34.470 --> 05:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
please hello again um Maris stoland
 
05:19:36.910 --> 05:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
OBGYN um I had a nice little speech
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
prepared Dr Zano told basically every
 
05:19:42.070 --> 05:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
point that I was going to make um so I'm
 
05:19:44.430 --> 05:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
not going to repeat those um I think
 
05:19:47.868 --> 05:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
members um uh of the Judiciary Committee
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
also probably remember me from last year
 
05:19:52.510 --> 05:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
because I also spoke about this topic um
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
when the previous um House Bill uh with
 
05:20:01.270 --> 05:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
similar language was introduced um this
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
bill has some very Troublesome language
 
05:20:07.310 --> 05:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
that I think Dr Zano
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
really hit on the points of um these
 
05:20:16.110 --> 05:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
scenarios where we have fetuses between
 
05:20:18.830 --> 05:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
this gray area um you know around what
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
we call Parry viability viability is a
 
05:20:22.830 --> 05:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
moving Target it depends on lots of
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
different situations but the bottom line
 
05:20:28.030 --> 05:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
is that these situations are are tragic
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
when they come up and um the language in
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is basically taking those
 
05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
tragic situations taking them out of the
 
05:20:39.150 --> 05:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
hands of healthc care providers and
 
05:20:39.160 --> 05:20:40.510 align:start position:0%
hands of healthc care providers and
essentially

05:20:40.510 --> 05:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
forcing um the presence of an
 
05:20:46.430 --> 05:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary second physician which
 
05:20:49.590 --> 05:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
affects Staffing ratios and other
 
05:20:52.390 --> 05:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
aspects of the hospital it also dictates
 
05:20:55.230 --> 05:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
that the ICU needs to be available which
 
05:20:58.948 --> 05:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
is not a finite resource and um not
 
05:21:01.470 --> 05:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
something that should be used as less
 
05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
necessary and it's demanding that those
 
05:21:07.350 --> 05:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
resources be available for a situation
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
that is futile um we do not have the
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
capability to resuscitate a fetus at
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
these gestational ages um and really the
 
05:21:21.750 --> 05:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
word um that for me it brings up is
 
05:21:24.910 --> 05:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
traumatic these situations are doing
 
05:21:27.470 --> 05:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
what this bill would suggest would be
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely traumatic it would be
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
traumatic for the fetus it would be
 
05:21:32.510 --> 05:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
traumatic for parents it would be
 
05:21:34.470 --> 05:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
traumatic for healthc Care staff it
 
05:21:38.310 --> 05:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
would be traumatic for um nurses it
 
05:21:40.868 --> 05:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
would be traumatic for the people who
 
05:21:44.430 --> 05:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
clean the rooms afterwards all of this
 
05:21:47.670 --> 05:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
is against every fiber of what we learn
 
05:21:51.190 --> 05:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
in medicine to do no harm to submit
 
05:21:53.830 --> 05:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
these um infants and these families to
 
05:21:55.628 --> 05:21:55.638 align:start position:0%
procedures that are completely
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and at the same time to
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
waste precious Health Care Resources in
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
a time when we don't have enough
 
05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
resources to do what we're trying to do
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
as it is it's appalling I I I can't read
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
this bill without getting upset I
 
05:22:14.910 --> 05:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill and I urge you
 
05:22:17.350 --> 05:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
also to do so thank thank you questions
 
05:22:19.548 --> 05:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
for this
 
05:22:21.788 --> 05:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thanks for taking my question
 
05:22:26.670 --> 05:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that that
 
05:22:30.030 --> 05:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state that perform um
 
05:22:30.040 --> 05:22:31.948 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state that perform um
deliveries

05:22:31.948 --> 05:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
deliveries
 
05:22:34.150 --> 05:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
have policies in place about when they
 
05:22:37.270 --> 05:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
will or will not um except transfers for
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
example for premature um uh labor or um
 
05:22:46.030 --> 05:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
perform life saving you know heroic
 
05:22:50.510 --> 05:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
Measures Etc on on um she are can you
 
05:22:52.030 --> 05:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
speak to that a little bit in terms of
 
05:22:55.788 --> 05:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
what how what those policies are and how
 
05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
they would interact with a a bill like
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
this uh sure I just redirect me if I'm
 
05:23:04.948 --> 05:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
not answering the question that you'd
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
like to have answered um depending on
 
05:23:10.510 --> 05:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
the gestational age and and I'll just
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
put a caveat that medical science is
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
constantly changing we are constantly
 
05:23:15.430 --> 05:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
evaluating the literature we are
 
05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
constantly looking at research and and
 
05:23:19.548 --> 05:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
trying to make the best decisions based
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
on new information so so these things
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes change over time and you know
 
05:23:25.590 --> 05:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
there there are Trends you know some
 
05:23:27.628 --> 05:23:27.638 align:start position:0%
actual parts of the country have the
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
technical capabilities to um you know
 
05:23:32.310 --> 05:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
potentially have better outcomes at at
 
05:23:34.110 --> 05:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
lower gestational ages than other parts
 
05:23:37.750 --> 05:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
of the country all of this is is um you
 
05:23:39.070 --> 05:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
know a little variable depending on
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
where you are and you know where we are
 
05:23:43.230 --> 05:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
in time and our understanding of of
 
05:23:45.628 --> 05:23:45.638 align:start position:0%
Medical Science um in terms of you know
 
05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
the resources to deal with different
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
situations um essentially the higher the
 
05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
gestational age um in that per viable
 
05:23:58.150 --> 05:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
window the more potential chance there
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
is um to resuscitate but the chances um
 
05:24:06.670 --> 05:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
of of success are still exceedingly low
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
um those chances of success are much
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
much lower at facilities that don't have
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
the same resources but before a certain
 
05:24:18.310 --> 05:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
gestational age it doesn't matter where
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
you are we just don't have the
 
05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
capability to to do anything to help and
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
so you know I think it is a phenomenon
 
05:24:28.708 --> 05:24:28.718 align:start position:0%
that sometimes happens where let's say
 
05:24:30.750 --> 05:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a scenario let's say um
 
05:24:35.110 --> 05:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
someone comes in at um 18 weeks and has
 
05:24:37.110 --> 05:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
um premature rupture of their membranes
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
meaning they broke their water um at 18
 
05:24:40.990 --> 05:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
weeks which
 
05:24:43.350 --> 05:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
essentially we can't do anything about
 
05:24:45.190 --> 05:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
we can't unbreak the water we can't
 
05:24:48.670 --> 05:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
reform it we you know at that point um
 
05:24:50.910 --> 05:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's basically nothing that
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
we can do except to try to prevent that
 
05:24:56.350 --> 05:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
patient from becoming septic um meaning
 
05:24:58.548 --> 05:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
having a an overwhelming bacterial
 
05:25:02.350 --> 05:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
infection um that could kill the patient
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
um and so in those situations
 
05:25:09.310 --> 05:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
um there there is no real benefit to
 
05:25:11.510 --> 05:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
transferring or using healthc Care
 
05:25:13.110 --> 05:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
Resources like an ambulance a Life
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
Flight um ICU resources different
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
doctors Specialists that's a waste of
 
05:25:19.350 --> 05:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
those resources for a situation that
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
really needs to be
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
handled at the initial place where it
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
presents because there is unfortunately
 
05:25:29.708 --> 05:25:29.718 align:start position:0%
I wish there were but there is no hope
 
05:25:34.150 --> 05:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
for resuscitating an 18we fetus and the
 
05:25:36.750 --> 05:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is that other facilities
 
05:25:39.190 --> 05:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
are equipped to be able to help that
 
05:25:40.948 --> 05:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
patient in a much more efficient and
 
05:25:40.958 --> 05:25:41.990 align:start position:0%
patient in a much more efficient and
expedient

05:25:41.990 --> 05:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
expedient
 
05:25:45.230 --> 05:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
manner does that answer your
 
05:25:47.470 --> 05:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
question believe it does thanks thank
 
05:25:50.750 --> 05:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this
 
05:25:53.310 --> 05:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.600 --> 05:26:11.310 align:start position:0%
 
Barry

05:26:11.310 --> 05:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.910 --> 05:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman honorable
 
05:26:14.430 --> 05:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Jake
 
05:26:16.350 --> 05:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
Barry I'm the vice president of policy
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
at new Futures as many of you know we're
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit Health policy and advocacy
 
05:26:22.548 --> 05:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
organization we've been working for more
 
05:26:24.670 --> 05:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
than 25 years to increase access to
 
05:26:26.310 --> 05:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
quality affordable health care and to
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
improve health equity in our state I
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat too much of what's
 
05:26:31.628 --> 05:26:31.638 align:start position:0%
been said this afternoon but I do want
 
05:26:33.628 --> 05:26:33.638 align:start position:0%
to stress new future strong opposition
 
05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
to both this bill and hb1 1248 which you
 
05:26:39.270 --> 05:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
heard earlier this afternoon simply put
 
05:26:41.350 --> 05:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
reproductive care including abortion is
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
a critical part of Health Care and
 
05:26:44.670 --> 05:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
access to abortion has vital
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
implications on the health and wellness
 
05:26:48.230 --> 05:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
of women families and children across
 
05:26:51.110 --> 05:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
our state data shows that women who do
 
05:26:53.070 --> 05:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
not have sufficient access to abortion
 
05:26:54.510 --> 05:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
when they need it are more likely to
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
struggle physically and financially
 
05:26:58.150 --> 05:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
they're more likely to experience
 
05:26:59.830 --> 05:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
life-threatening Health complications
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
including a IIA and postpartum
 
05:27:03.350 --> 05:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hemorrhage as well as other health
 
05:27:05.868 --> 05:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
conditions like chronic migraines joint
 
05:27:08.190 --> 05:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
pain and just and gestational
 
05:27:10.430 --> 05:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
hypertension both women and children are
 
05:27:12.070 --> 05:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
who are born as a result of abortion
 
05:27:13.750 --> 05:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
denial are more likely to live below the
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level and do not have
 
05:27:17.548 --> 05:27:17.558 align:start position:0%
the money they need to cover basic
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
living expenses like food housing and
 
05:27:22.230 --> 05:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
transportation and some to adopt further
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
abortion bans whether they 15 weeks as
 
05:27:26.590 --> 05:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill or 15 days as
 
05:27:28.510 --> 05:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
proposed in NH hb1
 
05:27:30.868 --> 05:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
1248 would have severe impact acts on
 
05:27:32.350 --> 05:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
the physical and Financial Health of
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
women and children that both they and we
 
05:27:36.270 --> 05:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
as a state will be paying for throughout
 
05:27:38.590 --> 05:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
their lifetimes for these reasons we ask
 
05:27:41.150 --> 05:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
you to oppose both this bill 1541 and
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1248 and vote itl thank you
 
05:27:45.990 --> 05:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions
 
05:27:48.830 --> 05:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.510 --> 05:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:27:55.628 --> 05:27:55.638 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Beverly
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh press you're still having a hard time
 
05:28:02.310 --> 05:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
with my last name it's licky it's polish
 
05:28:06.230 --> 05:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
and uh my my uh testimony has been
 
05:28:08.548 --> 05:28:08.558 align:start position:0%
already I mean I was curious of the way
 
05:28:10.628 --> 05:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
the language of the of the way the bill
 
05:28:12.750 --> 05:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
was written with the 15 weeks I was
 
05:28:16.990 --> 05:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
curious as to how prepared our uh you
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
know medical people were to to
