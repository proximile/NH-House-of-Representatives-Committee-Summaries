00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
while you're doing that for a sense of
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
timing uh i'm gonna try to have us
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
out of here uh before noon because some
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%

remarks will be brief not lengthy but
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer questions as long
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
as the committee may have them i did
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
submit my testimony per year request
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
to mr ripple i believe um i'm assuming
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
so let's uh let's talk to mr ripple real
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
quick um
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
you you send us a lot of great stuff did
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
this one is on the website in case i
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
didn't email it but just in case i'll
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
did you did you include in your
 
00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:19.350 align:start position:0%
did you did you include in your
testimony

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
some kind of a matrix to show us who
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
might be future residents and who
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
by type i a mr chair as part of my
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
testimony i provided a two-page analysis
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
of the data provided by
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
the department that discusses that um
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet matrix that you had
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
asked me to develop that i sent to you i
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
did not
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
share with the committee but i have no
 
00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
share with the committee but i have no
issue

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't intend to use i intend to go
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
off testimony
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
since you have my testimony i want to
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
highlight a few different points
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
but one of the pieces i do hope to
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
discuss is the analysis of the
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay so to the committee i'm going to be
 
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.550 align:start position:0%
okay so to the committee i'm going to be
forwarding

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
forwarding
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
um some work that mr de joy
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
did basically at my request and
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that with mr dejoy or
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
separately it's essentially a
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
cheat sheet for figuring out
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
what the impact on categories of
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
incarceration are
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry mr dejoy it's going to
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
take me another 60 seconds to catch up
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
with uh where you're at
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
all right uh i think i'm i'm ready for
 
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.829 align:start position:0%
all right uh i think i'm i'm ready for
you

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman and as i said
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to move off my testimony since
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
you have my testimony i'm going to speak
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
to a few other points
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
let me begin with a question that i've
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
become aware of lately that has arisen
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
and the question is why is this bill in
 
00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:29.190 align:start position:0%
and the question is why is this bill in
finance

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
now i can't speak with any expertise to
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
that but i can share with the division
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding of why this bill is in
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
in finance
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that both the
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
children family law committee and the
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
understood the potential impact this
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
bill could have on the census
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
at sysc given that potential
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
impact on the census it was understood
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
to make sense to consider this bill
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
in the context of the budget
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
because if the census is impacted the
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
budget could be impacted
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i further understand that there is
 
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
and i further understand that there is
some

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
expectation that this may become policy
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
of hb2
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
to travel along with whatever decisions
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
you make in the budget
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned to the division
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
previously children committed at sysc
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
are disproportionately experiencing
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral health concerns
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
are often children of color and based on
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
past suspension and expulsion data in
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
our children likely be living in poverty
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
and potentially homeless
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has been historically over
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
reliant on institutional care for
 
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
reliant on institutional care for
children

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
in part due to the lack of
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
community-based treatment
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
we often hear about bad kids we hear
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
about dangerous kids
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the evidence of this is often the
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
fact that they are
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
committed at all and the fact that they
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
have quote
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
failed many other programs
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
the oca discussed brain science last
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
week and discussed the impact of brain
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
development on reasoning
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
when we consider dealing with a child
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
who hits someone
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
do we imagine we'll address that child
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
the same as we would a 30 year old
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
or do we address their treatment based
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
on the combination of their maturity
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
and their behavior any parent that's
 
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.550 align:start position:0%
and their behavior any parent that's
disciplined

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
disciplined
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
a child understands that a two-minute
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
timeout for a five-year-old
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
maybe may mean the same as a five minute
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
time old
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
time out for an eight-year-old it's
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
dependent on the maturational level of
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
the child and the same is true
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
with addressing behaviors
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
of children that may come before the
 
00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.310 align:start position:0%
of children that may come before the
court

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
we know that in new hampshire in many
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
instances children are not placed in
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
treatment based on their needs
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
children are placed in treatment where a
 
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:51.990 align:start position:0%
children are placed in treatment where a
resource

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
resource
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
exists new hampshire has experienced a
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
dearth of community-based placements for
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
a significant period of time
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
which is why we became reliant on the
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
most expensive
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
least effective treatments such as sysc
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
the light at the end of the tunnel
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
though are the system of care
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
the federal family's first legislation
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
and the proposed probation reform bill
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
sb 94 is being heard today
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
hb 254 does not seek to remove
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
consequences for a child's action
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
rather it removes the most egregious
 
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
dispositional alternative
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
sysc from the from many of the available
 
00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:31.430 align:start position:0%
sysc from the from many of the available
options

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
now is the time to move away from this
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
ineffective treatment model in favor of
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
evidence-based interventions
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
not only are evidence-based
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
interventions more effective for
 
00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:39.910 align:start position:0%
interventions more effective for
children

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
they're also significantly less
 
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
they're also significantly less
expensive

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
if i could move now to the the data
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
analysis has the division
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
has the entire division seen the
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet the department um
 
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.870 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet the department um
provided

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
well we could provide a lot of
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets could you
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
narrow it down a little bit so last week
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
the dcmf provided a spreadsheet of
 
00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:07.670 align:start position:0%
the dcmf provided a spreadsheet of
charges

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
charges
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry petitions at
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
sysc for the years 2019 and 2020. you
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
access there mr ripple and if so could
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
you share it since we're talking we're
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
about to talk about it apparently
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair you do i if you don't have the
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
underlying data i'm going to analyze it
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
you'll probably
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
want to check my analysis against the
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
data at some point
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure if people need it in
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
front of them when i speak to this
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
this is a public hearing and so we
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
haven't distributed it to the
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
to the world so if you're gonna if
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
you're gonna speak to a document i'd
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
like to share the document if that's
 
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.389 align:start position:0%
like to share the document if that's
okay

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
fair enough putting mr ripple on the
 
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.829 align:start position:0%
fair enough putting mr ripple on the
spot

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.839 --> 00:15:02.069 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
just one moment while i bring that up
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
all right kevin and also
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
mr joyce since this is being recorded
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
anyone who comes in
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
afterwards to watch it then they would
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
benefit from seeing what you're talking
 
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.269 align:start position:0%
benefit from seeing what you're talking
about

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting mr george could you
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
there were three things you listed sp 94
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
system of care and another thing the
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
federal family's first legislation that
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
was passed in the omnibus bill
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
so it's being shared now mr dejoy can
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
you see it
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
i can't is this what you're referring to
 
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.310 align:start position:0%
i can't is this what you're referring to
sir

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
it is and i'm going to speak to an
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
analysis of the data as opposed to any
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
so analysis is your analysis on this
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
form now or is it separate the analysis
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
is in my testimony it's the last two
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to excerpt that analysis
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
as opposed to reading the whole two
 
00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:36.629 align:start position:0%
as opposed to reading the whole two
pages

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'll wait mr chair until you tell me i'm
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
ready to probably all right now we're
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
ready for you everything
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
this screen is up and we're just okay
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
so again um i analyze the data the data
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
are petitions of children at sysc during
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
the years 2019 and 2020.
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
let me start with the the caveat that
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that a data
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
analysis is not predictive
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
so this is not to tell you how many kids
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
will be in sununu
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
if two hb 254 passes it simply gives us
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
an understanding of the present in the
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
recent past
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
so based on the 2019 2020
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
petition data there's a clear picture of
 
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.110 align:start position:0%
petition data there's a clear picture of
how

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's important also to understand that
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
these the way these data are presented
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
it is each row is a single
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
child and all of the petitions
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
are over in the petition list it appears
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
from the extent of some of the petitions
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
that these actually represent multiple
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
petitions for some of the children
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
multiple commitments
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
for some of the children in the analysis
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
it treats every child as a separate
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
so there are more than 1700 petitions
 
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:58.630 align:start position:0%
so there are more than 1700 petitions
listed

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
between 2019 and 2020.
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
a petition is a as effectively a charge
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
individual charges is what a petition is
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
there are more than 1700 petitions
 
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.230 align:start position:0%
there are more than 1700 petitions
listed

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
there were fewer petitions uh listed in
 
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.150 align:start position:0%
there were fewer petitions uh listed in
2020

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
and consequently there were fewer uh
 
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
and consequently there were fewer uh
children

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
committed or detained at sununu in 2020
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
of the 1700 petitions
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
hb 254 to pass
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
92 percent of these petitions
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
could not not
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
form the basis of commitment to synonym
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
meaning that only about
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
eight percent of all these petitions
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
could form the basis of commitment
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
were 250 for hb 254 to pass
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
the data further suggests that were hb
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
254 to become
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
law that between 25 and 50
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
of the children on these two sheets
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
would continue to be eligible
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
for commitment if they committed future
 
00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:06.150 align:start position:0%
for commitment if they committed future
offenses

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
let me explain that a little bit because
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty wide range and doesn't
 
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.029 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty wide range and doesn't
really

00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
say much a number of these offenses
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
have aggregating factors if a weapon is
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
used it becomes committable if a weapon
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
is not used
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
it is not committable that's not our
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
decision that's
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's the way the um the criminal code
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
is often written
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
if we assume that every one of these
 
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.470 align:start position:0%
if we assume that every one of these
petition

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
petition
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
petitions that fit that criteria with
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
aggravating circumstances
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
if we assume every one of them has a
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
weapon involved
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
50 percent of these children would
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
if we assume that none of these offenses
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
in 2020 only 25 percent of the children
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
would remain committable in 2019 the
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
number was 33.
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
so that's why the range between 25 and
 
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.470 align:start position:0%
so that's why the range between 25 and
50

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
i think you know the question is will
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
come up so i might as well try to answer
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
it now
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
what's the difference what is this the
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
biggest single
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
difference the primary difference
 
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.310 align:start position:0%
difference the primary difference
between

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
current law and hb 254
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
is that hp 254 considers
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
serious violent offenses as committable
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
it considers offenses not categorized as
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
serious or violent
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
typically but not always typically
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level offenses
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
as not committable and again i want to
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
stress that this is
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
does not mean that the child would not
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
be before court it simply means
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
that we're removing the dispositional
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
alternative of sununu youth services
 
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.590 align:start position:0%
alternative of sununu youth services
center

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
but the judge still maintains every
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
other dispositional alternative
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
including community-based treatment
 
00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.070 align:start position:0%
including community-based treatment
including

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
residential care and the others in the
 
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.430 align:start position:0%
residential care and the others in the
list

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
in 169b will you take a question from
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative irf
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to representative
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr george could you just um
 
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr george could you just um
explain

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
i didn't quite understand you said 92
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
percent of the petitions would not
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
result in a commitment so
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's pretty clear understand that what
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
is the relationship between that
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
statement and the 25 to 50 statement
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
that you made
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
so one of the several of the offenses
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
and you can see it in the matrix that
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
was sent out in terms of the if
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
how the offenses are treated on the
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
defenses have aggravating circumstances
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
so for example one of the offenses is
 
00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.990 align:start position:0%
so for example one of the offenses is
robbery

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
robbery
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
if robbery is committed with a with a
 
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.270 align:start position:0%
if robbery is committed with a with a
weapon

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
weapon
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
or if bodily injury occurs
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
it raises the offense and that offense
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
becomes committable
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't involve a weapon then that
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
offense is not committable they can be
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
certainly be convicted but it is not
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
so if we well i i i i heard those words
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
and i understood those words
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm so are you talking about the
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
eight percent that
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
would not be committable uh but that
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
would still be committable
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
based on on your on this bill or
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
you talk about some subset of the 95 of
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
the 92 percent
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
so in the it's the 8 and the 92 percent
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
are just inverse of the same thing eight
 
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.590 align:start position:0%
are just inverse of the same thing eight
percent

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
of the petitions are would remain
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
committable 92 of the
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
set of petitions would not be remain
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
remain committable in those numbers i
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
assumed that every robbery
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
or similar offense with aggravating
 
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances that
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
every one of them would remain
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
committable that's included in that
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
eight percent number
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay so you assumed they were
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
aggravatable yes which is how you got to
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
the eight percent
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
correct so essentially this 25 to 50 is
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
removing people from that eight percent
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
if they did not have an aggravating
 
00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
if they did not have an aggravating
circumstance

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
um close the 50 number
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
assumes that those those robberies i
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
had aggravated offenses and remained
 
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.029 align:start position:0%
had aggravated offenses and remained
committable

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
committable
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
the 25 assumes that the aggravating
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances did not exist okay and
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
we're not committable so 50 so based on
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
this data
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
the most number of children that would
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
be committable under hb
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
254 based on this data are about 50
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
the lowest number if none of the
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
aggregating circumstances existed the
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
lowest number based on this data would
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
be about
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
five percent but twenty five percent of
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
the eight percent so two kids
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
twenty five percent of all the kids who
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
are listed on these two pages is being
 
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.990 align:start position:0%
are listed on these two pages is being
committed

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
committed
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
so there were eighty somewhat kids in
 
00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:17.190 align:start position:0%
so there were eighty somewhat kids in
2019

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
there were in the entire year of 2019
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
there was 70
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
in 2020. when i say 25
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
it means 25 of of those numbers you're
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
talking kids in one case and petitions
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
in another case okay thank you
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
i am and that's that's and i apologize
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
for that representative that's
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
a subject to the data the data combines
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
all the offenses
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
but then lists them by child so yes that
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
that is confusing and i apologize for
 
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:43.830 align:start position:0%
that is confusing and i apologize for
that

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
now that i understand now thank you i'm
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
sorry no
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
do we have a question from
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.590 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
yes

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair would you go over
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
again the difference between
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
criminal uh assault assault criminal
 
00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:02.950 align:start position:0%
criminal uh assault assault criminal
threatening

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
thank you i will mr chair i will caveat
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
that i preface that by saying i am not a
 
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:09.830 align:start position:0%
that i preface that by saying i am not a
lawyer

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to give you my plain
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
reading of the criminal code
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
there might be there would be other
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys who could give you a clearer
 
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.750 align:start position:0%
attorneys who could give you a clearer
idea

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that simple assault
 
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.110 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that simple assault
is

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
also classified as unauthorized touching
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
it can it can cover a wide range
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
of offenses from pushing slapping uh to
 
00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:35.669 align:start position:0%
of offenses from pushing slapping uh to
hitting

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
hitting
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that what is the
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
missing element
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening in and simple
 
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.630 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening in and simple
assault

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
assault
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
is as an adult and in the criminal code
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
typically classified as a misdemeanor
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
not as a felony
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening similarly is
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
classified as a misdemeanor is my
 
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
classified as a misdemeanor is my
understanding

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
unless the criminal threatening involves
 
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
unless the criminal threatening involves
um

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
a bomb or the
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
release of a biological weapon then
 
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.470 align:start position:0%
release of a biological weapon then
those

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
so uh mr joy let's let's take a a
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
little pause in the in your testimony
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
for a second and do
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
a quick document review uh
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
mr ripple would would you scroll
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
through the excel sheet that you're
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
sharing from youth 84
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
and scroll a little bit slowly so people
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
can get a sense of it all the way down
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
to the bottom
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
i will and if i could just add since
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative wallner is calling in
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
she can't raise her hand but she just
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
emailed me and i think she does have a
 
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.190 align:start position:0%
emailed me and i think she does have a
question

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay i'll come to her in just a moment
 
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
okay i'll come to her in just a moment
okay

00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair can i point out something just
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
as orienting the
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee to this spreadsheet please do
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
so in column b those
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
reference whether a child is detained or
 
00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:15.029 align:start position:0%
reference whether a child is detained or
committed

00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
committed
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
detention is pre-trial commitment is
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
i believe i can't see the top but i
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
believe uh
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
column c is a list of petitions
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
for that individual column d
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
column c is the count sorry a count
 
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:42.789 align:start position:0%
column c is the count sorry a count
right

00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
and the d is the is the enumeration of
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
those costs yep
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
and that's those two columns are the
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
reason that it's
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
it appears that these represent multiple
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh admissions for some of these children
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
because of the numbers of accounts
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
i could be i could be incorrect the
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
department could clarify that pretty
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
easily but it certainly appears that
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
these represent multiple
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
admissions so mr ripple would you go to
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
the excel
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
sheet that came from mr de joy called
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
committable offenses hb 254
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
and represent walnut for your listening
 
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.029 align:start position:0%
and represent walnut for your listening
uh

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
sorry just one moment here no that's all
 
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.230 align:start position:0%
sorry just one moment here no that's all
right

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
um i'm causing you to jump around and we
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
well if you let me share i can share
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay let's go to the top here and
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain this one uh okay
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
so uh i i've never really worked with
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
and what i needed to really understand
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
this um this bill was to understand
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
what offenses uh are under current law
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
can cause a commitment or detain uh
 
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.110 align:start position:0%
can cause a commitment or detain uh
status

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
at the sununu center versus what
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
of those offenses would continue to be
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh you can incarcerate somebody over
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
after if we pass hb 254
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
and so the x obviously on the far right
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
column shows that
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
that offense is so serious that whether
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's under current law or hb
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
254 it would continue to be able to be
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh incarcerate a child and then
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
if you'll scroll down and scroll down
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
this slowly the the committee members
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
have this in their
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
email but you can see
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
the offenses where we would be removing
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
those offenses
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
from the list of kids
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
and the yellow highlights indicate
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
what's where there is a difference
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
so mr joy put this together at my direct
 
00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.430 align:start position:0%
so mr joy put this together at my direct
request

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
because um i uh assumed
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
he had the insight to to do it
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
which he does and i i needed it because
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
i needed a simple way of understanding
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
what we were dealing with and
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
transitioning from
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
status quo to 254. so
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
so representative wallner if you're
 
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.789 align:start position:0%
so representative wallner if you're
still

00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
hearing us do do you have comments or
 
00:30:57.519 --> 00:31:02.830 align:start position:0%
hearing us do do you have comments or
questions

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
i i just got on zoom oh
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
um i was having some problems here this
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
i think we're talking about the offenses
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
at this point what i really like at some
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
point just if john
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
could um maybe do a little more
 
00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:28.789 align:start position:0%
could um maybe do a little more
description

00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
description
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
i think people have a hard time
 
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.990 align:start position:0%
i think people have a hard time
understanding

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
what the alternative placements are for
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
these children
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
what they would provide why they would
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
for many of these kids i think it's hard
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
having had um
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
the sununu center as a detention center
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
for so many years
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's hard for us to think about how do
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
we how are we going to
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
move kids from that
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
kind of facility how do we do that and
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
what do these what the do these new
 
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
what do these what the do these new
programs

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
or they some of them already exist what
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
do they look like and what do they
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
provide the kids
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
and why are they more appropriate so i
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
know you're having a discussion about
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
offenses and i was
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
um i would um
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
love to have john finishes talk about
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
that and then maybe talk about
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
why other kinds of programs are more
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
more appropriate
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna ask both you
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative wallner and
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative weiler for some advice
 
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.669 align:start position:0%
representative weiler for some advice
here

00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh i i understand that since we're
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
hearing 254
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
that we should try to stay within the
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
scope of what's in 254
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
and be careful not to go out to boil the
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
ocean because
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
uh some of what you're asking i think
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
outside the confines of 254.
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
so so since you asked the question you
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
you must believe it's a a valid question
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
within the scope of
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
i i do think it's a valid question i
 
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.350 align:start position:0%
i i do think it's a valid question i
because

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
i think that people um
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
have a hard time understanding unless
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
they've been
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
um deeply involved in the juvenile
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
justice system
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
i think they have a hard time
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
understanding what these alternatives
 
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.750 align:start position:0%
understanding what these alternatives
are

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
and it makes a difference when they're
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about whether they want to
 
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:29.830 align:start position:0%
thinking about whether they want to
change

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
who goes into the sununu center and who
 
00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:33.750 align:start position:0%
who goes into the sununu center and who
doesn't

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
i think they just have to understand
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
that to make a good decision
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's just my my own thinking about it
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
i do believe there are some um
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer there is at least one lawyer on
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
the on the line
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
that could probably help in this
 
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.430 align:start position:0%
that could probably help in this
conversation

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair mr skibby who was a colleague
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
of mine in the juvenile reform project
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
just um texted me saying he is on the
 
00:34:00.399 --> 00:34:00.870 align:start position:0%
just um texted me saying he is on the
line

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
and is pleased to speak to the legal
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
things that i'm floundering on
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
is in terms of the differentiation
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
between the offenses
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
okay so sort of i think to restate
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
representative wallner's question a
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
little bit is
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
and let's scroll up to the top mr ripple
 
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
and let's scroll up to the top mr ripple
please

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
okay so under 254
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of kids that could have
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
gone to the sununu center that won't
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
i i hear representative wallner's
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
question to be
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
if if they don't go to the sununu center
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
what are the alternatives and do those
 
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.990 align:start position:0%
what are the alternatives and do those
alternatives

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
exist today and i'm happy to answer that
 
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.629 align:start position:0%
exist today and i'm happy to answer that
question

00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
to the extent that i'm able to so the
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
169 b19 which is the dispositional
 
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.190 align:start position:0%
169 b19 which is the dispositional
statute

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
in juvenile justice has a broad
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
range of dispositional alternatives upon
 
00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:00.230 align:start position:0%
range of dispositional alternatives upon
conviction

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
it runs the gamut from the child
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
returning home
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
and potentially receiving little to no
 
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.069 align:start position:0%
and potentially receiving little to no
treatment

00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
receiving therapy in the community
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
receiving some type of community-based
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
specialized treatment all the way up to
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
intensive in-home treatment foster care
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
potentially behavioral health or mental
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
health inpatient treatment if that's
 
00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:27.030 align:start position:0%
health inpatient treatment if that's
necessary

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
it runs the entire gamut and what the
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
statute says
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
is that we should the justice should
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
always use the least restrictive
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
alternative meaning
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
when the children can be at home they
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
should be at home
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
what occurs many times is judges don't
 
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.310 align:start position:0%
what occurs many times is judges don't
know

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
what alternatives exist and they only
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
become aware of what alternatives exist
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
based on data presented to them by the
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
jppos and so when
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
if the jppo is recommending residential
 
00:35:57.119 --> 00:35:58.150 align:start position:0%
if the jppo is recommending residential
placement

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
placement
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
typically that's what the judge is going
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
to go with
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
i will point out that some of the
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
treatments that i just referenced
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
are only now becoming available
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
under the system of care this is where
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
the system of care becomes important so
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
treatment like
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis where trained clinicians
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
go into the the community in the child's
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
home at the moment of crisis to assess
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
and how best to intervene with this
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
family that is just being stood up
 
00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.109 align:start position:0%
family that is just being stood up
currently

00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
things like multi-systemic therapy
 
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.550 align:start position:0%
things like multi-systemic therapy
intensive

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
intensive
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
in-home treatment over a period of a
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
couple of months
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
child and family is the contract is out
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i believe the rfp
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
has closed and hopefully will be awarded
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
shortly that
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
those are both important treatments for
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
the population we're talking about that
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
will either
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
are online or will be coming online in
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
the very near future
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
they're expensive treatments but their
 
00:36:59.359 --> 00:37:00.310 align:start position:0%
they're expensive treatments but their
expense

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
expense
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't is nowhere near the expense
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's budgeted for senior youth
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
services center
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
it also the key point of it it keeps the
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
child in their home
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know i mentioned that last week
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
what's common among
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
all juvenile justice children
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
is that unless they extend jurisdiction
 
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
is that unless they extend jurisdiction
for

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
a couple of years all children are going
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
back to this to their home
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
when they turn 18. judicial orders
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
expire at 18 for these children
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
they don't go to the adult system unless
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
they've been tried as an adult
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
so we ought to be preparing every child
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the community for where they're going
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
to be living which is
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
in their community and that's why these
 
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:45.910 align:start position:0%
in their community and that's why these
intensive

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
intensive
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
community-based treatments are so
 
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.589 align:start position:0%
community-based treatments are so
important

00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh no i think that was i think um john
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
did a good job describing where where
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
what we need to have
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
where these children would go if they
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
were not at sununu thank you
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
mr chair can i add one more point that i
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
think is
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
is relevant sure so we know from the
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
child protection system
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
that historically
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
we have been a very small c conservative
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
system meaning that the system does not
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
is not comfortable with risk and
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
assesses risk conservatively so it
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
it is more restrictive than it perhaps
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
needs to be and i would suggest that we
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
have the same situation in the juvenile
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
justice system which is part of the same
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
division so it makes sense it's the same
 
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.430 align:start position:0%
division so it makes sense it's the same
situation

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
that we're often more restrictive
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
having difficulty assessing risk and not
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
to place the child appropriately and i
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
would point as evidence of that
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
to the um the detention survey
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
that is completed before children are
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
detained in the juvenile justice system
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh the department started using this i
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
believe in the last number of years
 
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.670 align:start position:0%
believe in the last number of years
maybe

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
14 15 16 and at one point
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
more than 50 percent of the children
 
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.910 align:start position:0%
more than 50 percent of the children
committed

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
committed
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
to sununu or detained at sununu did not
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
score high enough
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
to require detention or commitment
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based tool
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
now i know the department has revised
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
the tool
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the rates of override
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
are now override means the child does
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
not need detention
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
based on the scale but is detained
 
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.910 align:start position:0%
based on the scale but is detained
anyway

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
those high rates of detention point to
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what i'm talking about
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
is that we're uncomfortable with the
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
assessed level of risk
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
and defer to a much more restrictive
 
00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:06.230 align:start position:0%
and defer to a much more restrictive
alternative

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative your hand is
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
still up
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
ma'am representative
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
do you have a question i have two
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
questions if you don't mind
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
mr um one's an easy one
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
i noted on your on your spreadsheet that
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's one case actually two cases
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
where current law would not result in
 
00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:33.829 align:start position:0%
where current law would not result in
somebody

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
being committed or detained in this new
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
center but
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
hb254 would i just wonder is that
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
so current law which came about
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
from hb 517 back in in 2017 and i think
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're i
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
can't scroll it down i think you're
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
referring to burglar
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
destruction of property appears to be
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
one and
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
unauthorized entries appears to be
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
another so entire classes
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
in 517 entire class
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
classes of statutes were restricted from
 
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.069 align:start position:0%
classes of statutes were restricted from
detention

00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
detention
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
because they were considered to be not
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
with this time around we dug into those
 
00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.150 align:start position:0%
with this time around we dug into those
statutes

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit more deeply and that's
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
where you what that's
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
those statutes are where you'll see some
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the aggravating factors that we
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
contemplated as appropriate for
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
commitment when the aggravating factor
 
00:41:35.119 --> 00:41:36.230 align:start position:0%
commitment when the aggravating factor
exists

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's the difference and i think mr
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
skibby can probably give you
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
a more coherent response than that
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay uh thank you the other
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
question relates to
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
just to make a point i guess i'm looking
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
current at the governor's current
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
proposed budget
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
and in the medicaid area auto home
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
placements and community-based services
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
which are currently budgeted at zero
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
that jumps up over fifty thousand
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
dollars close to sixty i mean million
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
up to close to sixty million dollars
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
um these placements i'm assuming
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
is that accurate is that is that what
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
that increased money would be for to get
 
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.430 align:start position:0%
that increased money would be for to get
people

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
the kind of people that would be in
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
sununu but if they're not there
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's i believe is broader than sununu
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
i think the department could respond to
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
that but i believe
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know the placements are not just
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice placements that dcyf
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
placement so it may be
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
child protective cases it may be um
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice cases
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
so i think that's kind of that's a
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
combination i think the other place
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
the the dollars are in the system of
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
caroline in the children's behavioral
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
health division
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
the system of care i believe is at
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere over 4 budgeted somewhere over
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
14 million dollars
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 15 million dollars and 23 if i
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
remember correctly and that is
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
the continuation of the system of care
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
programs that was stood up
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
in hb 14 uh back in 2019
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
so i think it's both places um our
 
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.190 align:start position:0%
so i think it's both places um our
potential

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
possibilities for placement thank you
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i think what we should do is
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
um we've sort of none of us are lawyers
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh or criminal lawyers so so i i don't
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
we would benefit much more for from a
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
deeper dive into the
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes here what what i think
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
we need to do as a finance committee is
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
understand what we're about to do and
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
and understand what
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the financial and systems
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
implications are so
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
i i would like to bring somebody in from
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
at this point and to respond to anything
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
that they've heard
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
and if somebody can talk to us a little
 
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:51.829 align:start position:0%
and if somebody can talk to us a little
bit

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
about what they suspect the financial
 
00:43:55.359 --> 00:43:55.990 align:start position:0%
about what they suspect the financial
impact

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
of hb 254 would be that'd be great
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't know why there wasn't a fiscal
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
note with this
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill but there isn't
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
so on that point i'll just say that the
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill ols sends us bills for fiscal notes
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
and we haven't received one
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
um so i'm not sure maybe just lost in
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
the shuffle it might
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
have just been an oversight that we
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
didn't get it um so that's why there's
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note attached
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see anybody in the audience with
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr dejoy
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh appreciate your testimony and the
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
work you put into uh preparing for today
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
um mr skibby and raised
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
let's bring him in i would like to hear
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
from somebody from the department but
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make a couple of
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
comments um
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
first with regard to the data that the
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
department provided
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
my experience with this data coming from
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
the department is that it does not
 
00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:18.390 align:start position:0%
the department is that it does not
represent

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
the charges or which children were
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
actually committed to the sununu center
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
rather it represents a list of all
 
00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:28.309 align:start position:0%
rather it represents a list of all
charges

00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
charges
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
that have at any time been brought
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
against a child
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
and so it means that a typical
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
circumstance may be
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
that a child picks up
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
charges over a couple of years
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
most of those end up being disposed of
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
without any
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
placement particularly a placement at
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
and then eventually that child ends up
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
either due to treatment failure
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
and you know things not working out or
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
because of an escalating offense pattern
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
eventually ends up at the sununu center
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
and when they
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
run this data for you or for
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
other purposes they basically list all
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
the charges that are in the history of
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
this child so i think
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
it would be a mistake to look at all of
 
00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:24.550 align:start position:0%
it would be a mistake to look at all of
these

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
charges and say that any one of them
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
resulted in a commitment to the sununu
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
center the way that courts
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
work typically in juvenile cases
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
is that once they decide to
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
impose a serious sanction on a child
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
they just work with one of the petitions
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
they don't re you know revise the
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
dispositions on all of the petitions
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
that may
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
still be active for a child i mean one
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
weird things about the juvenile justice
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
system as compared to the criminal
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
justice system
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
is that basically the the disposition or
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
the sentence thing as it would be in the
 
00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.150 align:start position:0%
the sentence thing as it would be in the
adult

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
adult
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
system basically remains you know a work
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
in progress until the
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
court is done with a case and so there's
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
constant revision of these dispositions
 
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.829 align:start position:0%
constant revision of these dispositions
including

00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
moving a child from home into some place
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
like the sununu center so i think it's
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
important to understand that
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're not looking at a picture of the
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
of the things that actually result in
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
commitment to the sununu center
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
i think typically only one or two of the
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
more serious
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
of those offenses would typically
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
actually be what triggered the
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
commitment to the student center
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i think
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think another point i want to make is
 
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.549 align:start position:0%
i think another point i want to make is
that

00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
typically what triggers commitment to
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
is is not the offense
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
the nature of the offense itself and one
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you will
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
typically hear during discussions of how
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
the sununu center has been used over the
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
last several years
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
is that typically there's a series of
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
placements that are tried before a
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
child's end ends up at the sununu center
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
so that typically let's say somebody
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
who's in there for simple assault
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
they'll put the child in the probation
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
will fail they'll put the child into a
 
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
will fail they'll put the child into a
residential

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
residential
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
treatment center that will fail they'll
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
put them into another residential
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
treatment center that will fail
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
and eventually they'll throw up their
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
hands and say we're going to put this
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
child at the sununu center
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
the importance of that is that you're
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
seeing the sununu center being used not
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
because of serious offending but because
 
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:40.549 align:start position:0%
because of serious offending but because
of

00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
serious failures of the existing
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
community treatment system
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
so that oftentimes many of these i mean
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
getting better at a fairly rapid clip
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
and that's really good news for our
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
state and for
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
the children in our state but typically
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
what happens is that you have a lot of
 
00:48:59.790 --> 00:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
placements that have very
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
under-resourced treatment
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
offerings clinical you know services
 
00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:06.790 align:start position:0%
offerings clinical you know services
available

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
and so they end up being places where
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
children's underlying problems are not
 
00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:11.750 align:start position:0%
children's underlying problems are not
being

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
addressed and so they tend to fail in a
 
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.510 align:start position:0%
addressed and so they tend to fail in a
series

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
series
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know in you know in a pattern uh
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
or as you say in a repeated pattern and
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
you eventually see kids ending up at the
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
cinema center
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
the last point i'll make is that
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
there are jurisdictions around this
 
00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:31.589 align:start position:0%
there are jurisdictions around this
country

00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
that have basically said we are not
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
going to put misdemeanor level offenders
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
in our corrections facilities
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
um i looked at this several years ago
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
the one that was most striking to me was
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
that california has that
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
has that in their system they they have
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
just said we are not going to
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
put such a minor offender into such a
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
harsh setting as a corrections facility
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
even a juvenile
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
corrections facility and those those
 
00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:03.190 align:start position:0%
corrections facility and those those
jurisdictions

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
have have survived using that practice
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire can survive using that
 
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.549 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire can survive using that
practice

00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
we unfortunately have a long-standing
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
pattern of using very harsh
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
consequences for very minor offenses in
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
this state as compared to the rest of
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
and i guess related to this is that
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
what you do with a with a child makes a
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
big difference in terms of their future
 
00:50:26.559 --> 00:50:27.589 align:start position:0%
big difference in terms of their future
recidivism

00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
recidivism
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
and it's not in the relationship is not
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
intuitively obvious
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
the harsher you are the more the more
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
you separate a child from their home
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
from their school from their community
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
the more likely it is
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
that they will offend in the future both
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
as a as an older child
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
and as an adult so public safety
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
suffers when you do that well you take a
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
question i we we we have just a limited
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
as i think what you're saying uh
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee has
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
has heard similar testimony before and i
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
believe we all share a very common value
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
system around
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
it and accept it i think i think the
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
a question they got asked earlier i i've
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
not heard an answer to and i think we
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
need to answer to
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
is if we don't put these kids in
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
the sununu center is the infrastructure
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
built today to handle the alternative
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
model if if if if it's
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
if we're putting kids into sununu
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
because we don't have
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
good alternatives today which i think i
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
heard you
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
imply is do
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
we still need those alternatives first
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
before we release kids into the
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
community into a setting that
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
could you respond to that sir
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that the answer to that is
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know approaching you know the later
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
stages of the build out of
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
of the system so that they will be
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
prepared for the minor
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
offenders that you still see showing up
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
in smaller numbers at the
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
new center so that you know the
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
department is in the process
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
of coming into compliance with both
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
the the requirements of senate bill 14
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
and with the federal legislation that
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
john de joy
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned so that my understanding is
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
that by the end of this
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
calendar year most of those
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
improvements will be in place and the
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
structure of this legislation is that
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
there would be an additional six months
 
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.349 align:start position:0%
there would be an additional six months
before

00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
before sunday new center would become uh
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
unavailable as
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
a uh as a sanction in those minor
 
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.030 align:start position:0%
a uh as a sanction in those minor
offenses

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
so the effective date on this bill is
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
january 1 2022.
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
so it sounds to me like you believe that
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's that that would i mean if senate
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill 14 is complied with
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
and if the federal legislation the
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
federal statute is complied with then
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
yes we would be
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
ready uh for the effective date of this
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
of this legislation this legislation
 
00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:12.950 align:start position:0%
of this legislation this legislation
also

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
allows for an additional period of time
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
before detention becomes unavailable for
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
charges okay representative rogers do
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
um no i actually have a comment that i'd
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
like to make um
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
you earlier said that none of us were
 
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.190 align:start position:0%
you earlier said that none of us were
attorneys

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
um and not criminal attorneys and i just
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to remind you
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
that i served as a prosecutor and a
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
county attorney
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
and in fact practiced in the juvenile
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
courts so
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
one of us is in fact a criminal attorney
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
with experience in the juvenile courts
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to make that clear now
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the reminder you you
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
i did know that i forgot that no no
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
offense is implied
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
if i were to use humor i'd say i think i
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
promoted you by saying you weren't an
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
attorney but
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
but uh but that's just understand and i
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
won't take that as an insult
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh okay so uh representative erf do you
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes mr thank you so i think this is
 
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.309 align:start position:0%
yes mr thank you so i think this is
great

00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
but i still have the question that i've
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
never been able to get a good answer to
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
even with this in place it sounds like
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
there would still be a handful maybe a
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
very small handful maybe just a couple
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
um who wouldn't who would still need a
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
place like sununu
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
is that a question for me yes
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
that was you're the intended okay
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
i just to clarify are you talking about
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
the people who could legally be placed
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
at this
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
at the sununu center or people who would
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
no longer be legally placed
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
no so it sounds like if this 254 were
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
in place quite a few children who were
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
young adults whatever are who are
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
currently the sununu center would be
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
able to move out into the community if i
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
understand correctly
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
but not 100 of them maybe there'd be 25
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
percent left
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that's only two people i don't
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
know the numbers but let's just say it's
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
even one person
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
what what what is the what do you do
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
with that person or those people
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
kids the person who is still legally
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
um uh who could legally be placed at
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
some place like the sununu center
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
well if it's somebody who legally can be
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
placed at the sununu center
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
then there would have to be a continued
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
corrections like facility available a
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
secure placement
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
and i don't think anybody is making the
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
claim that there will no longer be
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
any need for a secure placement because
 
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.950 align:start position:0%
any need for a secure placement because
unfortunately

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
you do occasionally have have to place
 
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:52.950 align:start position:0%
you do occasionally have have to place
someone

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
for public safety reasons and some
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
children do end up being prosecuted as
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
adults for extremely serious violent
 
00:55:59.599 --> 00:56:00.870 align:start position:0%
adults for extremely serious violent
offenses

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
so you will need to have some capacity
 
00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:04.390 align:start position:0%
so you will need to have some capacity
available

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't think anybody thinks that
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
you need 144
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
bed facilities to serve that purpose
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i i think that's the answer is that
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
you know some some jurisdictions have
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
gotten away
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
with very small more cost effective
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
facilities like a dozen beds or fewer
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
did i answer your question
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you mr skibby
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
um for for the department about 10 days
 
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.789 align:start position:0%
um for for the department about 10 days
ago

00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
i began a dialogue asking
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
for a budget estimate
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
of how much the sununu center would cost
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
if we brought the census all the way
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
down to
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
two kids for the whole year because
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
if if we still need a secure facility
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
i was just curious what given the amount
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
of fixed cost
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
associated with the sununu center
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
is if there would be any benefit to the
 
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.829 align:start position:0%
is if there would be any benefit to the
general

00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
funds if the census was as low as
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
as two people for the whole year and
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
i would like to know if anyone from the
 
00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:29.510 align:start position:0%
i would like to know if anyone from the
department

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 days has done a financial
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:40.549 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
i see no one in the audience with their
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm really kind of disappointed about
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
that because that would be important
 
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:49.990 align:start position:0%
that because that would be important
data

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the absence of a fiscal note on this
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
um so i see representative long
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the audience could you could you
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative long how are you sir it's
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
been a while since i've had a chance to
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
talk to you
 
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm just curious if you i'm
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
blindsiding you i apologize for that but
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
what what would your thoughts be if um
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
division three retained this bill
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
rather than uh otp
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question uh mr
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
chairman i um
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
although i feel this is an important
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill that continues on our progress with
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh juvenile justice reform um
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah if you felt that uh that would be
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
better uh
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
in address i mean you're you have an
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
important question as far as the uh
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
um what what are the savings um
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
personally i'd be looking for an
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
alternative place we don't need the
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
large facility that we currently
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
maintain and heat
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
and all that uh so yeah no i uh
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have an issue with uh
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
retaining if that's what the committee
 
00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:20.950 align:start position:0%
retaining if that's what the committee
felt

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
felt
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
they would need for better information
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you you've listened in do you have
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
any other general observations from your
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
listening in today uh
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
i don't actually i believe uh mr dejoy
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
and mr skibby did a
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
did a great job that was my um
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know if if testimony i know
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative rice
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
asked me to be here because she wasn't
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
able to be here
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so the only thing is i i know the
 
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.750 align:start position:0%
um so the only thing is i i know the
difficulty

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
of putting money forward today for
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
potential savings tomorrow um i get that
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
delivery you're asking
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
you're asking the right questions in my
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
opinion and uh
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'd be interested in those answers
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
myself but i
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
do believe that the state has been
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward and we have the luxury
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
of other states dispositions of
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
these matters that give them savings
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
and better services to their youth
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative wallner i'm going to ask
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
you the same question as a sponsor or
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
do you see what what downside do you see
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
of us retaining this rather than otp or
 
01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:41.109 align:start position:0%
of us retaining this rather than otp or
itl

01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
hope that if we retain it that we
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
will take a look at it as being
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
in how it works into the budget
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
negotiations that we do
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
around the sununu center i think
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of there's a lot of
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
people talking about the future of the
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
sununu center and
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
what other alternatives could take could
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
take place and i i would like to see
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
if we are retaining it i hope it's not
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
just to
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
um do it so that we don't deal with it
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
but we
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
really take it into this bill into
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
consideration as we work on the budget
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i hear that completely and i
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
i given that i don't have awareness
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
of exactly what alternative settings
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
would be required
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
and what is being done to make them
 
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.870 align:start position:0%
and what is being done to make them
available

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh and that i don't know what the cost
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
estimates are associated with the
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
diminished census at the sununu center
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
i you know i i just i i do think that
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's information that's essential to
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
this decision that just
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
can be made available but that isn't
 
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.109 align:start position:0%
can be made available but that isn't
today

01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
so um so that's what i'm thinking but
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i agree with
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative walder and i think
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
part of the issue is there are a lot of
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
moving parts
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
there's sununu there's our budget
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think if we can make sure we don't
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
lose track of it
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
as she talked about and
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
the discussion is parallel to all the
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
other discussions about sununu
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
i think that would be helpful and and
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
maybe in a few months
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
we'll know more than we know now so i
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
think that would be fine
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
all right uh well it doesn't
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
it the house calendar today oh
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
representative walter your hand is up
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
no i just i just want to remind everyone
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
that we do have
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
a number of uh pieces in the budget i
 
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:00.950 align:start position:0%
a number of uh pieces in the budget i
mean

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
we've had a long conversation about the
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe we need to review that again
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
as we
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
um as we look at as we look at this bill
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the budget because
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
the system is care
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
is crucial to this to this working
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
so um i mean it's all energy there's a
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
lot of interconnected pieces
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i just want to be sure we keep it
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
available and work on it in the budget
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you i think you've heard me so we
 
01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:32.710 align:start position:0%
thank you i think you've heard me so we
have

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
two hands up in the attendees i think uh
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
ms ross had her hand up first and then
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
we could go to
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh mr cunning
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%

01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%

to mr ripple this morning
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
which was the same information that we
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
had previously provided
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
to house child and family law that may
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
be helpful
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
including some data on the number of
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
youth that are
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
at sysc the tool that the court
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
uses as the detaining screening
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
instrument that you heard about
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
and the number of offenses in this bill
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
um in their actual statutory definitions
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
and the changes that would no longer be
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for commitment
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm very encouraged by the
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
discussion of retaining this bill
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think that you'll see from our numbers
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
that the number of youth committed
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
is very low and has been been on that
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
trend for a number of years
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
specifically um one of the pages from
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
the data book will really show you
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
that from 2016 until now that that trend
 
01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:49.910 align:start position:0%
that from 2016 until now that that trend
has

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
substantially decreased um but we have
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
some concerns about
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
this bill getting out ahead of the other
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
changes including fully building out the
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
and knowing how that's going to impact
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
the system i think two of the unintended
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
consequences we may see if this is done
 
01:05:07.039 --> 01:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
consequences we may see if this is done
prematurely

01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
prematurely
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
is that prosecutors are less likely to
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
enter plea agreements for lesser charges
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
and have a longer and more drawn out
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
adversary judicial process with some
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
youth which we don't think would be
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
in their best interest as well as
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
seeking to certify more youth as
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
adults and drive them further in to
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
the adult criminal system when if we
 
01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:33.109 align:start position:0%
the adult criminal system when if we
support

01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
things like sb 94 that would be looking
 
01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:37.190 align:start position:0%
things like sb 94 that would be looking
at

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
moving children and youth away from the
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
judicial process getting
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
earlier um assessments and
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
diversion and treatment in the community
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will be seeing less folks
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
ending up in the judicial system and
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
therefore less
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
um entering sysc at any point in
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
their minority um however if we if we
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
close that door too early before the
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
other things are built and in place
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
um we will not see those cost savings
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
nor will we get them the services that
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
they need
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
to keep them out of either sysc or later
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
the adult correctional facility
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
so we would welcome having this bill
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
retained having further discussions
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
about what the costs are
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
i will also um note that the fiscal
 
01:06:26.559 --> 01:06:27.029 align:start position:0%
i will also um note that the fiscal
folks

01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
are working on the the cost questions
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
that you asked i am not the person to
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
answer that and would not want to speak
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
but there is a group of folks working on
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
the responses to those questions that
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
you asked representative edwards
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you ms ross it's uh
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
it really is helpful so uh i'm not
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
seeing any questions
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
um miss and particularly thank you for
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
letting me know that people are working
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
on the cost estimates with a census
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
estimate of two people
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's great news uh
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
can you hear me mr chair i can you're
 
01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.549 align:start position:0%
can you hear me mr chair i can you're
great

01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
oh thank you um thank you mr chair
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
my name is keith kinning i'm the
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
advocacy director at waypoint john and i
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
work together
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
um i just want to push back a little bit
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
on the retention of the bill
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
um there are i've seen from um
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
the child advocate maura o'neill dr
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
nomore o'neill that a small facility
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
of four to six kids can be built and
 
01:07:33.839 --> 01:07:34.150 align:start position:0%
of four to six kids can be built and
then

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
operated for about 1.5 million dollars a
 
01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.829 align:start position:0%
operated for about 1.5 million dollars a
year

01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
compared to the 13.8 million
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
that the department is requesting i
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
think that the committee should
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
understand that that's 13.8 million
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
which does not include a million dollars
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
they spend on electric
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
electricity which is not put in the
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
budget plus some
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
amount of money that goes into overtime
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're probably looking at over
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars a year that the state
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
is running the sununu center on which
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
could be dropped to probably about 1.5
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
to run a fault a small facility for the
 
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.029 align:start position:0%
to run a fault a small facility for the
remainder

01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
remainder
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
of those children um i think you also
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
have to believe that there's a
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
possibility that if the structure is
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
built correctly
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
um that cost could be half if it's not a
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
completely locked facility in some way
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
or we can build it in a way it might be
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
50 medicaid reimbursable
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
which means that you're only looking at
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
750 000 a year to run a facility
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
compared to over 15 million dollars to
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
run the sununu center
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
i think i'm i'm greatly disturbed by the
 
01:08:36.239 --> 01:08:37.110 align:start position:0%
i think i'm i'm greatly disturbed by the
idea

01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
that we won't have sb 14 up and running
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
in the next two years i think the
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
proposal that's before the committee
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
um gives the department lots of time to
 
01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:47.269 align:start position:0%
um gives the department lots of time to
finally

01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
put sp 14 and what sp14 is supposed to
 
01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.070 align:start position:0%
put sp 14 and what sp14 is supposed to
do

01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
in order to protect children um i
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
believe sb14 can be up and running
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the next two years which would allow
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
the children that are excluded from the
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
to have the home-based and
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
community-based services that they need
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and let's not forget um
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
every day this place stays open the way
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's run right now with the children
 
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:12.709 align:start position:0%
it's run right now with the children
that

01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
aren't supposed to be in there um we're
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
damaging these children
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's just no doubt about it that the
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
kids don't that don't belong
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the sununu center are damaged by
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
being in the sununu center they need to
 
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.550 align:start position:0%
being in the sununu center they need to
be

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
in community-based services that sb14
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
provides to them only the kids that are
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
a danger to themselves
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
or a danger to the community should be
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
in a locked facility and those children
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
are probably
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
less than two or three people that would
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
end up in a much smaller facility so i
 
01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:41.590 align:start position:0%
end up in a much smaller facility so i
would

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to seriously um
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
consider not retaining this bill
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
um i read a quote um there was a quote
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
iraqi premier uh when the pope came to
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
visit and they said why not wait for a
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
better day he said people will say to
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
wait for a better day
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
but we must act now to get us to a
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
better day we have to act now
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
to allow the hhs to get the system of
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
care up and running in the next two
 
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:06.550 align:start position:0%
care up and running in the next two
years

01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then have a small facility for those
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
remaining children
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
that do belong in a locked facility but
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of those kids should not be
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
there and so
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
um i'd ask the committee strongly and
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
you mr chair not to retain the bill and
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
for us to move forward i think we can
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
get you the answers that you want
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
and there would be significant
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
unbelievable cost savings by not having
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
the sununu center open
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you sir are there any questions
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
from mr kennedy
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cooning um i
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
would like to schedule an exec session
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
on hb 254
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
for monday morning at 9
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
30 on the 21st of uh of march
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
can can you can you make that happen mr
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
ripple with the notices
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay so um
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
so to the committee members think about
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
what we should do
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
think about if there's any amendments to
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
this like for example
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
moving the effective date from january 1
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
22 to maybe
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
23 or something so that we we know that
 
01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.350 align:start position:0%
23 or something so that we we know that
we

01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
we don't cut cords too quickly
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
um but whatever let's uh let's exact
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
this on the 21st
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
if if there are other no other questions
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%

on hb 254 and open the hearing
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
on hb 600. i i believe earlier i saw
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative william marsh uh in the
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
attendees could we bring him in
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
the committee can you hear me
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
yes sir hi thank you
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh for the record i'm representative
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
william marsh representing seven towns
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
in southern carroll county and i'm
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
pleased today
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
to offer for your consideration house
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
bill 600
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
relative to funding newborn screening
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
tests which i found at the request of
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital association
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's newborn screening
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
program is a wonderful program and the
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is not to change the
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
program in any way
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
the issue i that i have with the program
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
is how they send out their bills
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
under current law dhhs bills hospitals
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
for the filter paper on which blood
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
samples are submitted for testing
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of this filter paper has
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
doubled in the last year
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
i believe it's approximately 146 dollars
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
and it is approximately equal to the drg
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
payment that medicaid pays
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
for a hospitalized birth and this is
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
expected to increase as more tests are
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
added to the newborn screening panel
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
fill the papers to supply and this bill
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
cannot be submitted to insurers there is
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
no charge for the test
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
performed we are simply asking the
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner to restructure the current
 
01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.270 align:start position:0%
commissioner to restructure the current
fee

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
fee
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
so that these bills can be submitted to
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
insurers instead of billing for
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
filter paper the invoice could read
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
newborn screening panel
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
other states do this for instance in the
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
state of texas effective january 1st
 
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.630 align:start position:0%

01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
and thereafter hcpcs code
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
s3620 was implemented for newborn
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
metabolic screenings
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
minnesota uses the same billing code the

pursuant to 45 cfr 147.130
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%

insurance law this being the finance
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
committee it's appropriate for you to
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
consider the alternative solution to
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
currently 45 states including new
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire pay for newborn screening
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
through fees although some do supplement
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
using general funds five states and dc
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
simply pay for the program out of
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
in one-third of states at least some
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
general fund revenue supports newborn
 
01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.950 align:start position:0%
general fund revenue supports newborn
screening

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
screening
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
the alternative solution which would be
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
equally acceptable to the hospitals
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
would be for you to retain the bill
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate funds for the program
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
and use the trailer bill to roll the
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
fees back to the reasonable level they
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
were a few years ago
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
obviously i prefer the solution
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
presented to you in house bill 600 but i
 
01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:23.350 align:start position:0%
presented to you in house bill 600 but i
recognize

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
some of you may be less adverse to
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
growing publicly funded programs than i
 
01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.630 align:start position:0%
growing publicly funded programs than i
am

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
am
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
whatever solution you choose addressing
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
the problem will help maintain the
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
economic viability of the various
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
birthing centers in new hampshire
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i will remind you all we just lost
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
the birthing center in laconia
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh at lake surgeon hospital thank you
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll be glad to take questions
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh representative marsh uh
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative erf over the weekend it
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like you had some questions would
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
would you like to ask them while you
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
have a chance here
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's sure thank you mr chairman um so
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
reading the
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it seems that part of what
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're doing is shifting
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
medicaid costs back onto the state
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
shifting them onto the state not back on
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
that would depend how you structured the
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement under medicaid
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
when we discussed this at the uh rare
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
disease advisory council which i am
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
chair we were advised
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
by the medicaid director that
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
any reimbursement for the test would be
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
cut out of the
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
day rate for uh newborn births under
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
medicaid which would be cost neutral to
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh any revenue that we generate from
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
insurers of course will be additive
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh to the hospitals and that's what
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're wanting is some relief from the
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
onerous fees they're now having to pay
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
can you clarify how to be cost
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
neutral to the state the state is half
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the medicaid fees
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
henry lipman said that that if they paid
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
75 dollars for these tests they could
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
reduce the day rate
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
for newborn births by 75 which would end
 
01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:00.790 align:start position:0%
for newborn births by 75 which would end
up

01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
a net of zero okay i'll ask henry about
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
that then thank you
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any uh follow-ups there
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
no are there any other questions for
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh dr excuse me representative marsh
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative wallner thank you
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
um can you talk a little bit i i must
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
say i was surprised when i heard
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
that the way we were being reimbursed
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
for these newborn screening
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
was through the hospitals um
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
having to purchase these um filter paper
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
can you talk a little bit about
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of the filter paper and what
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
for that has been passed on to the
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
hospital this way instead of
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
it being part of um reimbursements from
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
individuals or their insurance carrier
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
well i was not in the legislature when
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
this was first set up it's been done
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
this way in new hampshire for quite some
 
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.030 align:start position:0%
this way in new hampshire for quite some
time

01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh the rates used to be quite nominal i
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
sent you a paper of what the
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
rates for the fees used to be about 15
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
and and at that point in time i don't
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
think anybody cared because they were
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
normal enough that it was
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
a matter of indifference but with the
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
rates doubling in the last year
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh this has really become a serious
 
01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.350 align:start position:0%
uh this has really become a serious
issue

01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh plus hospitals finances are not what
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up representative i
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
i do just just a short one this in no
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
way will affect
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
um the screening that is done of our
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
newborns i mean they
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
they will still all get the um
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
get the newborn screening is that
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
correct well one of the issues we have
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
is that more tests are being added to
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
the newborn screening panel as more
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
metabolic diseases become treatable
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
and insofar as the reimbursement remains
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
an issue i think there will be
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
resistance to adding new tests to the
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
screening panel
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
if we actually solve the reimbursement
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
problem so that the hospitals are not
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
penalized so much
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
for the newborn screening test i think
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
there will be less resistance to adding
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
tests to the newborn screening panel
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
and that would be beneficial to the
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
babies going forward
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
great thank you for your uh testimony
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman could you just
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
clarify the cost you just referenced i
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
i was looking at your i did you send us
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
more than this your testimony as far as
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
that goes
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh i sent you one page of testimony but
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
over the weekend i sent you an
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
article from pediatrics actually i sent
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
it to the chairman and he sent it to the
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i'd be glad to send it again if you
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
would like no if we have it i'll find it
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
there thank you
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
so representative marsh my question for
 
01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.470 align:start position:0%
so representative marsh my question for
you

01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
is um related to uh
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
my listening in on the the hearing that
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
you had on
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
on hb 600 and
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
towards the end of that there were a
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
number of representatives from the
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
that that came in and asked
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
that we not pass hb 600
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
right away because they didn't perceive
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
that they had had an ability
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
to discuss the problem and to enter into
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
negotiation with uh with the hospitals
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
and um and i'm just i'm just curious
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
how you interpreted that testimony and
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
what your thoughts are on the subject
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
well there are lots of insurers in the
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
world and it's hard to catch every
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
single one of them i will tell you that
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
anthem is represented
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
on the rare disease advisory council
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
where this was first discussed before we
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
even drafted it into a bill
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
and other insurance jurors i did speak
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
to while flying
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
and the general reaction was they got a
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
pretty good deal for a great many years
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
and they were happy for that uh
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for a change in
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
insurance law the the federal law is
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
quite clear on the subject
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
um but uh nevertheless there's always
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get the message and it comes to
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
the hearing i understand that
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%

01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:17.510 align:start position:0%

01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
you at this point thank you for
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
introducing your bill
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
we have two members of the audience that
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%

01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
and collaborative partner
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
at work with us on these issues and um
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh the it's we we just want to be very
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
clear that the the fees actually
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
is meant for the program work so
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
it supports has has put in the
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation the
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
fees that we collect it's currently 146
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
dollars for each filter paper
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
and that actually covers all our work uh
 
01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.149 align:start position:0%
and that actually covers all our work uh
basically

01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
the staff as well as our um operational
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
costs for the program
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
as well as the ch um the lab uh testing
 
01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.550 align:start position:0%
as well as the ch um the lab uh testing
cost

01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
we currently uh conduct around 37
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
conditions we test for 37 conditions
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
and all of these conditions are
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
currently covered um these are required
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
these are
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
has um provided on the on the federal
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
level these are like the required kind
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
of conditions that we need to screen for
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
so for like almost um two years ago we
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
our cost first filter paper was around
 
01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.030 align:start position:0%
our cost first filter paper was around
46

01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
46
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
and in the last year we added almost
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
like uh
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
600 uh four conditions that actually
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
increased our cost to almost
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
146 dollars so i just i just want to
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
point out that it's not for any other
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
purpose other than the testing and the
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
cost of maintaining the program
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
because those those filter papers cost
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
is used for
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you are there any questions for
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any uh thank you for your
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman um members of
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
the committee i hope you can hear me
 
01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.430 align:start position:0%
the committee i hope you can hear me
okay

01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
great thank you for coming today thank
 
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.350 align:start position:0%
great thank you for coming today thank
you

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative marsha's bill here is
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh the medicaid program supports the the
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
filter paper is
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
effectively a means to
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
pay for the the testing that was
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
described by dr shirella
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
um you know since the discussion of this
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh bill began that we've lost actually
 
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.189 align:start position:0%
uh bill began that we've lost actually
two

01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
places where women can deliver babies
 
01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:15.350 align:start position:0%
places where women can deliver babies
both

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
the lakes region one that uh
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative marsh mentioned as well
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
as parkland and
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
in derry i think the the department's
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh maintaining network adequacy um this
 
01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh maintaining network adequacy um this
bill

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
in a small way it contributes towards uh
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know fairly um allocating the cost
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
for this vital service even with the
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that representative marsh
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
talked about the hospitals are still
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
helping to subsidize
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
the availability of a program that you
 
01:24:44.239 --> 01:24:44.629 align:start position:0%
the availability of a program that you
know

01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
is not just a medical issue it's a
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
long-term cost to the state and all the
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
different programs that
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
support people who have those conditions
 
01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.470 align:start position:0%
support people who have those conditions
so

01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's an appropriate bill i would
 
01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.510 align:start position:0%
i think it's an appropriate bill i would
uh

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
just footnote that
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
in our fiscal note we were thinking that
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
it would um
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
it could be implemented with uh the
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
support in the medicaid
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
program um the fiscal note contains i
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
think a 225 000
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
total funds estimate it could also be
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
implemented as
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
the way representative marsh said it
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
could be just netted into the drg
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
payment for the delivery but i think in
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
terms of medicaid covering its fair
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
share on this i think the way we have it
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
described in the fiscal note would be
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
right so um
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
so i have a couple questions about this
 
01:25:44.159 --> 01:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
so i have a couple questions about this
um

01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
would the department be able to
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh implement this law if passed
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh given that the effective date is just
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
60 days after its passage
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
after the governor's signature
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
potentially is is that enough time for
 
01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.110 align:start position:0%
potentially is is that enough time for
you

01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
to to adapt to the change
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
i i think we we can do so
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
we would need to file a state plan
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
amendment if we implemented
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
an increase in payment um and uh
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
it could be if it was passed in july we
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
could file
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
something by the end of september to i
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
think cover this
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
and that would allow us to be able to do
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
that i mean
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
um there's also some a small amount of
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
computer programming i think we pretty
 
01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.030 align:start position:0%
computer programming i think we pretty
much

01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
be able to do uh the 60 days after
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
if you were to recommend a number of
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
days after passage
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
what what would you professionally
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
recommend so that your department can
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
absorb this change
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
and include the i.t reprogramming sure i
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
think 90 days would be
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
um a little bit uh given all the other
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
are likely to come up out of this
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
session if this were the only thing i'd
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
be very comfortable with 60 but
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
i know some more coming our way but if
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
it needs to be 60
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
and then to
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative marsh's observation that
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
he thinks to the
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
state budget that this would in effect
 
01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:18.629 align:start position:0%
state budget that this would in effect
be

01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
cost neutral do you agree with that
 
01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.790 align:start position:0%
cost neutral do you agree with that
observation

01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
observation
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh and if not are are you able to tell
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
us since we're in the heat of the budget
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh battles what what the impact would be
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
on say the governor's proposed budget
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
so it could be implemented as
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
described but since medicaid is a
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
significant provider of um
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh delivery of babies in the in the
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
state and particularly in the more rural
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
parts of the state and those are the
 
01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.229 align:start position:0%
parts of the state and those are the
more

01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh challenging areas where um keeping a
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
place open
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
um for deliveries is is even more
 
01:27:59.850 --> 01:27:59.860 align:start position:0%
challenging um
 
01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
challenging um
[Music]

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know i think that uh we had included
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
in our fiscal note the anticipation that
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
we would
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
we would pay the 75 dollars as described
 
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
in the bill and i think the fiscal note
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
says 225 in total funds
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
and again i think in terms of
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
what it what it's going to mean to us if
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
we don't keep all the places open
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
that are now still available
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
particularly in the rural areas this is
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
a very small
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
investment that uh you know will help
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
contribute i'm not saying it guarantees
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
anything but
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
i think uh unfortunately it's becoming
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
more and more challenging as the number
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
of births
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
are fewer and um you know as
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative marsh said this has been
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
a challenging time and you know i think
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
even with
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
um making some payment we're still the
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals are probably still
 
01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.709 align:start position:0%
hospitals are probably still
contributing

01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
historically what they have contributed
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
towards this program and it won't cover
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
their full cost
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
so a couple times in testimony it's been
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
implied that if we
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
it could potentially be a key thing to
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
keep any of them from closing and
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
i i that's that's a little bit of a
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
stretch to me i
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
i yeah excuse me i would agree that it
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
in and of itself it would not be the
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
determining factor but certainly
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know there's just there's evidence
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
if you just look at it in terms of if
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
you look at the map of where to
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
to deliver uh children i'm it's
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's really uh declined quite a bit over
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
the last five years
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
or so and there's
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know for example littleton hospital
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
in the north country
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
is you know or not for i think
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
some cares act money would have ended up
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
closing as well
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
and so i think we really have a network
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
risk here
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
um and this is probably one thing that
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
we can do now there are probably other
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
things we'll have to do in the future to
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
to maintain reasonable access for for
 
01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:05.189 align:start position:0%
to maintain reasonable access for for
people

01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
our state so i appreciate
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
that and um as i think about the dhhs
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard i don't
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
recall anyone telling us
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
that we had a potential crisis of
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
birthing centers closing and as a result
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
i don't recall
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
any programmatic effort to address that
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
and i know it's bigger than dcyf
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
but i'm just uh curious on your thoughts
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
on whether this should be more of a
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
departmental priority something where
 
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:40.390 align:start position:0%
departmental priority something where
all

01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
we got our eyes on instead of just
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
talking about in background
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
well i think that the the department um
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
has actually been
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of insurance and the
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner of uh
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
hhs have been in conversations about the
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
concern because i don't think
 
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid alone is not going to be the
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
way that
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
um that facilities are maintained in the
 
01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.350 align:start position:0%
um that facilities are maintained in the
state

01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
um and so i think that while it may not
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
have read
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
race to a legislative level public
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
health looking at
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
um you know there's been in the media
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
about births being done on the road
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
as opposed to um you know in facilities
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
that there is a there is a concern here
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
and i think probably uh the covid
 
01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.350 align:start position:0%
and i think probably uh the covid
situation

01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
has kept both commissioners pretty busy
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of elevating it to a higher
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
level but
 
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
that certainly is an issue that we're
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're uh
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know if we lose littleton and we
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
lose one one other
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
rural one we really have a problem in
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
terms of access and again this is
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
not trying to oversell this particular
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
provision as being the answer to it but
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying we have
 
01:31:48.730 --> 01:31:48.740 align:start position:0%
work to do um to avoid a crisis
 
01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.229 align:start position:0%
work to do um to avoid a crisis
[Music]

01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh adding that perspective
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh i have a question for uh
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh would you have any objection to us
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
changing the effective date from 60 days
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
to 90 days
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay oh oh i see lots of uh hands up now
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh i'm gonna do um
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%

association
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
um i don't really have testimony per se
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
i wanted to be
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
um available for any questions anyone
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
and i i actually want to um thank
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
on the record for being so supportive of
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
and really helping us um to kind of
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
shepherd it through
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
and working with um through the rare
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
disease council as he mentioned he has
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
been very transparent with what the bill
 
01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.270 align:start position:0%
been very transparent with what the bill
does

01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
um and getting input so um i just wanted
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that and thank the
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
department as well
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
um both on dr shirella and
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
mr lipman um so i am happy to answer
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
any questions um and again this is
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
this is just um kind of a um an effort
 
01:33:25.679 --> 01:33:26.070 align:start position:0%
this is just um kind of a um an effort
to

01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
just kind of not right or wrong just
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
just to address the the ability of the
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals to be able to recoup some
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
of the costs um associated with this
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
program again
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
as representative marsh and dr shirella
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
has said this does not change the
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
structure of the program
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
at all um but as she also indicated it
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
went and as dr
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
marsha's excuse me representative
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
marsha's um
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
information she he shared it went from
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
18 to
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
40 to 71 and now it's 147
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
um dollars so it's just it just
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's more and more expensive and again
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
there is an
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity as other states have done to
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
change this from
 
01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
a supply um which just gets rolled into
 
01:34:17.679 --> 01:34:18.149 align:start position:0%
a supply um which just gets rolled into
the

01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
drg um or the does the um
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
diagnostic um um grouping that they
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
build for or or you can just build it as
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
a as a lab
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
and this just is allowing that to
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
occur that's really all this does um but
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
um are there questions from ms minahan
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
i i have one for you um are you
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
do you think that the new hampshire
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
hospital association
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
is currently engaged in a strategic
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with the department
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
or others to address the crisis
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
in um
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
child bearing centers and that's not the
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
right term but you know what i'm saying
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
birthing centers um
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals and birthing centers yes in
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
fact um
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
mr lipman has reached out to mr anand
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
our president
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
to of the association to to have these
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
discussions and we
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
are in um doing some research
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
um to provide some information back to
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
the department and
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
um and like mr lipman said it's a
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
broader discussion
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we actually um have been um
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
having it's it's a very it's very
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
complicated because
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
it involves um quality of care
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the fine the financial um
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
impact of having a birthing um center
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
within a hospital
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
ex and the change in our demographics
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
especially up in the north country it's
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
a really complicated
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
issue but access to care and increase
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we have adequate network
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
for our birthing centers
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
um is extremely important to to everyone
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
um here certainly in our hospitals um so
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
yes we have um to answer your question
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
begun those discussions excellent thank
 
01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:15.350 align:start position:0%
begun those discussions excellent thank
you

01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
so much i uh i hope everyone stays
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
engaged with that it sounds like we have
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
a problem we need to deal with
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
um all right so are there other oh right
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%

01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
question for ms minahan no
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
just uh note to you uh mr chairman i
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
have to go

before you go or
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
nope it sounds like it's going along

very well okay
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
i would propose that we exact this also
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
on the 22nd
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%

01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%

01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you miss minahan appreciate it
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
hello thanks so much for bringing me
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
over this is sabrina dunlap i'm director
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
of government relations at anthem
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
um we did testify on this bill
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
originally we're we're really just kind
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
of puzzled by it because
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
we have not heard from the hospitals on
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
this issue i checked with our
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
contracting folks and typically this is
 
01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:29.430 align:start position:0%
contracting folks and typically this is
something

01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
we would have heard about before um and
 
01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.030 align:start position:0%
we would have heard about before um and
so

01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
i can say i'm really still unclear on
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
what the need is to legislate
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
this issue um so you know we we've said
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
that before and
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
still listening to others speak on this
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
i i still don't know
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
really why this is needed um again this
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
is something i think we would typically
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
engage in
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
with contract negotiations and this has
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
not come up
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
um we we did not know this was coming
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
from the hospitals
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
um as representative marsh mentioned our
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
medical director does sit on the
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee for rare disease but
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
um i couldn't quite hear what he said
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
but i heard something like
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
we got a good deal i'm not sure what
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
that meant but um i can say we were
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
we were not um prepared for this bill to
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
come out of
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know even though our medical
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
directors on the rare disease committee
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so i'm not sure what that suggestion
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
was because i couldn't quite hear but
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
anyway just wanted to clarify that um
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know we're generally just puzzled by
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
this and again
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure the connection
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
to you know the cost of these strips to
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
birthing centers closing i'm not sure
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
um totally accurate it seems like a bit
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
of a stretch
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
so anyway thank you so much for letting
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
me testify in this
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in miss donald uh
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for her
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
for anthem i'm
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh dr tarella welcome
 
01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.629 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh dr tarella welcome
back

01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative edwards
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to follow up on the
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
timing of it
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
given this legislation sits and we might
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
have to do some rule changes so we might
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
need some time
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
so i just want to bring up that to the
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
just from our timing point of view
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
we're a finance uh committee you have to
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
how much time i think i think the
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
proposed 90 days to 120 days would be a
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
good timing
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
just given that where are where our
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
schedules are specifically with the
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
impact of covet so that's the reason i'm
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative marshall i think
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
you're still on sir
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
um would you have an objection to 120
 
01:39:45.119 --> 01:39:45.910 align:start position:0%
um would you have an objection to 120
days

01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
i i really don't this problem has been
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
building for years uh
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and uh um i i think
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals will be happy to see
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we are reaching a resolution to the
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
problem and
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
whether it happens in 60 days or 120
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
days i don't believe it's critical
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anything else dr trella i
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add to the conversation
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
about the birthing hospitals we in
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
public health has been keeping track for
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
10 years on the birthing closure of
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
birthing hospitals
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
and we recently started doing a two
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
years we have been doing a proposal
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
research proposal with
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
with people at up at dartmouth some of
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
our obgyns as well as
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
from rwg some of the funding is coming
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
to support some of the
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
understanding and uh we have been doing
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
some focus groups
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
and some of that information actually
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
actually is being
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
being uh funneled to our department to
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
talk about you know
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
what kind of issues where those things
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
are and we have been tracking this issue
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
especially from you know um what kind of
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
perinatal care the
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
the families or the the moms are getting
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that way we can understand what the
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
the long-term impacts of these the
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
closer closures would be on the on the
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
future of new hampshire
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
good i i hope i hope everyone keeps
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
collaborating with one another and
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
looking for some solutions it's
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
this is a departmental priority for us
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for dr
 
01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.709 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for dr
trella

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
trella
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see any hands up in the
 
01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.790 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see any hands up in the
attendees

01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
so what i would ask you to do
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
mr ripple is to put an
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%

01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
name if you
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
just to keep it simple changing the
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
effective date from 60 days to 120 days
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
and and we'll uh exact that on monday

hb 600 thank you dr marsh and everyone

and um thank you
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
so so the rest of our time on the house
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
calendar was scheduled for
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't have anything prepared for
 
01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:36.390 align:start position:0%
and i don't have anything prepared for
this

01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
work session other than to say
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
that i became i should have known but i
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
i really became re-aware of
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh of three hb2 notes
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
when the veterans home talked to us
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
yesterday they're in footnotes but i
 
01:42:55.629 --> 01:42:55.639 align:start position:0%
guess they're also an hb
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
106 7 and 8 respectively i think
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
and and we need to schedule a discussion
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
and vote on those
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
um i i think we could uh
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
those are pretty i'm guessing that those
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
are pretty non-controversial
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
so i would like to add them to friday if
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh those sections so that we talk about
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
them friday
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and and try to vote and vote on
 
01:43:23.199 --> 01:43:23.750 align:start position:0%
and uh and and try to vote and vote on
them

01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
so okay this is the
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
time of the committee meeting where uh
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's open to any committee member for
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
the good of the committee what do you
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
have any questions comments concerns
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative wallner you you got your
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
hand reaching to raise your hand and
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
you're on mute
 
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
you saw me so yesterday you presented us
 
01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:47.990 align:start position:0%
you saw me so yesterday you presented us
with

01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
a new budget document
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
and i have i have concerns about that
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
at this point basically it
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
was one person or two people or some
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
group of people's
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
um idea of how to rewrite the budget i
 
01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:06.310 align:start position:0%
um idea of how to rewrite the budget i
mean

01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
now it's called the baseline budget and
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
in about an hour
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
an hour and a half from now we're going
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
to have a public hearing
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1 and the public haven't
 
01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:17.990 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1 and the public haven't
seen

01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
this new document so i think a lot of
 
01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.189 align:start position:0%
this new document so i think a lot of
the

01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
testimony will be around
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
um house bill one obviously that's what
 
01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:27.990 align:start position:0%
um house bill one obviously that's what
they

01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the uh hearing is for and
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
without them knowing that there is this
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
new document out there
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm really concerned about us sort of
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
changing horses at the end of the
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
the end of the race here um
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
if if there was going to be an
 
01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:46.870 align:start position:0%
if if there was going to be an
alternative

01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
kind of budget proposed
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
to work from i think
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
it should have possibly been and i've
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
never seen this happen before but i
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
think it might have been where it should
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
have happened would have been
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
that house bill 1 should have been
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
that document and that way
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
everyone would have a level playing
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
field for knowing how to proceed
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
so i i do have i do have concerns about
 
01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.189 align:start position:0%
so i i do have i do have concerns about
it

01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm also concerned about
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
areas of the budget that are that are
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
quite complicated and i think we've just
 
01:45:26.719 --> 01:45:27.350 align:start position:0%
quite complicated and i think we've just
spent

01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
we just spent like three or four weeks
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
going through
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
the budget both house bill 1 and house
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill 2.
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
we've come across some very complex
 
01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.310 align:start position:0%
we've come across some very complex
issues

01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm worried that they will get
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
lost or they some of them could the
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
potential could be there
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
for them to get lost in this new way of
 
01:45:50.639 --> 01:45:51.669 align:start position:0%
for them to get lost in this new way of
budgeting

01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
budgeting
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i under i understand why
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
there is the desire to do this because
 
01:45:58.719 --> 01:45:59.350 align:start position:0%
there is the desire to do this because
it's

01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
adding back and it's being positive and
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's saying yes
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
instead of um saying
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
that you need to do some reductions to
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that that desire to not be
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
cutting the governor's budget i can
 
01:46:17.679 --> 01:46:18.550 align:start position:0%
cutting the governor's budget i can
understand

01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
i can understand why this has come about
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned that everyone doesn't
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
have the same information and they
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
aren't all working with
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
with it at this point um
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm also concerned about what what
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
kind of a workload is this putting on
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
the lba
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
because is this document going to be
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
loaded into
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
the budget system um
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the end won't we actually be
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
having a house bill one
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
that will show possibly reductions in
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
certain areas
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
um so i'm just just putting those things
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
i know in about an hour like i said in
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
about an hour an hour and a half we're
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
going to have public input
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't think many people in the
 
01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
and i don't think many people in the
public

01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
even know about this new this new
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
document and so you might have people
 
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
asking to not have their line
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
to level fund their line only to find
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
out that
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
in the new base budget that line from
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget is much reduced
 
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
and so they should be asking to add back
 
01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:37.990 align:start position:0%
and so they should be asking to add back
to

01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
the base budget um i think it's got a
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion a lot of
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of potential for for confusion for
 
01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:45.669 align:start position:0%
a lot of potential for for confusion for
people

01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
um but i'm whatever whatever whatever we
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
decide to do
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
however we decide to do it i'm here to
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
i'm here to do it
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do you have a
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
comment there
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i agree with what mary
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
jane said
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
i also think it's very complicated that
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
the first year of the governor's budget
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
is his
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
proposed budget but the second year
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
is the same as the first year so
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of different
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
typing problems for
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
lba and i think that's as very jane said
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
is we're just going to add confusion
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
to the people who think they're
 
01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:36.790 align:start position:0%
to the people who think they're
testifying

01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
on a budget they have seen from the
 
01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:40.709 align:start position:0%
on a budget they have seen from the
governor

01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
in the second year but now
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's not so i just wanted to add that
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
comment thank you
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and uh just to
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
respond to
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
maybe partially to both of you and if i
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
if i don't
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh complete the circle please bring me
 
01:48:58.800 --> 01:48:59.350 align:start position:0%
uh complete the circle please bring me
back

01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
i to the to the to the very fair point
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
that we may be overloading mr ripple
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
and mr felstad uh with a lot of changes
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh i've begun to talk to mr ripple
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
explaining to him
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
that i don't know the tools that he has
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
available to him
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
to manage our hb1 changes
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't know therefore if i don't
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
know the tool i don't know the workload
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's associated with that
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
and talking to him a little bit i i
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
think i understand
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
that that if
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
if if a line item is in the governor's
 
01:49:40.239 --> 01:49:41.270 align:start position:0%
if if a line item is in the governor's
budget

01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
then and we don't change the governor's
 
01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:45.350 align:start position:0%
then and we don't change the governor's
budget

01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
then it's easy it's already done and it
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
and and it's any changes other than that
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
um to like for example if we went back
 
01:49:54.719 --> 01:49:55.109 align:start position:0%
um to like for example if we went back
down

01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
to a fy 21
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
base number that would reflect a change
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
we would that would require updating
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
manually by either mr ripple or mr
 
01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:08.550 align:start position:0%
manually by either mr ripple or mr
felstad

01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
felstad
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
is is that right mr ripple
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
i am i am sensitive to the idea that if
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
we can accept the governor's budget line
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
that that works for the transparency
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
reasons that representative wallner and
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
nordgren have mentioned
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
and it works also for
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative sake of
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
the lba um and if
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
we get to the point where we're looking
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
at lines
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
and we're choosing between a few
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars here and there
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
i think the bias would be to keep the
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
in fact what
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative irf and i have done in
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
conjunction with
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
the republican caucus really is
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
we've taken the fy 21
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
budget that's a public document that's
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
in order to improve visibility
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
of fy21 we added back
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
the hb4 items that aren't
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
transparent i mean they're technically
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
there in the public view
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
but because those hp4 items aren't
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
brought into
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
hp1 we we lose visibility of them
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
so when i refer to an enhanced
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
fy21 baseline
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
that refers to what the
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
budget is in the current year plus the
 
01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:53.350 align:start position:0%
budget is in the current year plus the
ad

01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
ad
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
backs from hb4 to give us
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
a clear view on what uh the dollar
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
amounts are
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
so so we don't we don't as a division
 
01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:08.229 align:start position:0%
so so we don't we don't as a division
three

01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
have a proposal on our budget until
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's the 24th or maybe a little bit
 
01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:15.830 align:start position:0%
it's the 24th or maybe a little bit
earlier

01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
as i understand it the the budget that
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
comes out of division three
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
is never the same as the current year
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it's never the same as the
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal it's always a
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
different thing
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
anyways so we're going to get to a
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
different thing
 
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
anyways we're just going to do it from a
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
process of using
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
the fy21 enhanced baseline
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
meaning fhb4 is brought in there
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to take a look at
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
and and and see how much
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
money is freed up by looking at
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
the ways and means estimates versus
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
fy21 and then we'll be in a position
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
to support the priorities we think
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
are important and i don't know i
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
fundamentally i see that as the process
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
that every division three in history has
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
had to do
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
one way or the other i'm just maybe
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
changing the order a little bit
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
but i think uh i i think it's
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
transparent in the sense that we're
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
using the current budget
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're making it more
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
transparent by adding the
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
hidden hp4 items uh and
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
we're taking a look at the governor's
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
budget and we're trying to figure out
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget assumed um
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
about 77 million initially
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
over the biennium more than ways and
 
01:53:46.159 --> 01:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
over the biennium more than ways and
means

01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
so fundamentally our task was always
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
going to be hard
 
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
it was always going to be the governor
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
had 77 million dollars in the biennium
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have the luxury of
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
and when asked to help us
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
with that 77 million dollar difference
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
we were told by the governor's office
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
that it was really
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
their work was done they think that our
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates are too conservative
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
and since then they published another
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
letter saying they're expecting it
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
more revenues and and they've requested
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
more investment in various priorities
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
because we're bound to live within the
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
means that ways and means gives us
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
we can never reach what the governor is
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
proposing we just can't get there
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
so i would rather have us focus on
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
the positive conversation of saying okay
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
given our current year we accept
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the current year's budget was
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
passed by the majority two years ago
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
the the spending priorities of the
 
01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:11.030 align:start position:0%
the the spending priorities of the
majority

01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
two years ago when they went through
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
this process we
 
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
recognized that fy21 the current budget
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
is something like 24 more
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
than an fy 19. so so sir so there is a
 
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:26.470 align:start position:0%
than an fy 19. so so sir so there is a
rather

01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
rather
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
large increase in spending
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
in the from the prior budget to the
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
in my experience when an organization
 
01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.030 align:start position:0%
in my experience when an organization
experiences

01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
that much growth it's very hard
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
to maintain efficiencies and
 
01:55:45.599 --> 01:55:47.189 align:start position:0%
to maintain efficiencies and
effectiveness

01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
and so when you couple the pandemic
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's okay
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
to start with an fy 21 base because
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
they haven't grown to the fy 21 level
 
01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
as it is so it still represents a growth
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
from them from where they are
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
to what the current budget envisioned
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
them to be
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
so so even if we were to freeze fy21
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
it would still represent real growth
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
in dhhs from where they're at right now
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
but nobody on our side is proposing
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
freezing fy21
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
we see that there's a possibility of
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
taking about 100 million
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
about a third of it in the first year
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
two thirds in the second year and adding
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
that back
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
we're essentially going to have to blaze
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
our own path
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
because we can't follow the path to
 
01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.669 align:start position:0%
because we can't follow the path to
governor

01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
pursued because his revenue estimates
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
were so much larger than
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
the ones were allowed to work with
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
so so we're we're we're kind of starting
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
where the governor started
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
using the current budget from here we
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
have to blaze our own path
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
and and we and we've got
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
resources to invest above the fy
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
21 enhanced baseline
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
and we may have more we we've asked ways
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
and means to come back and give us a
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
confirmation on what they think their
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
best guess
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
revenues are on the 23rd of march
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
if not sooner so but we're never going
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
to have as much as the governor
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
is assuming that's a very long answer to
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
um but um i'll
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
oh i'll i'll give you back the floor of
 
01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:48.710 align:start position:0%
oh i'll i'll give you back the floor of
representative

01:57:48.710 --> 01:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:50.830 align:start position:0%
representative
[Music]

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
walner um thank you
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
so i realize you'll never have as much
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
revenue as
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
the um the governor
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
had in his budget unless the ways and
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
means committee
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
decides that they would like to
 
01:58:08.719 --> 01:58:09.990 align:start position:0%
decides that they would like to
reevaluate

01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
reevaluate
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
their revenue estimates so i understand
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
i understand how that works i understand
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
it very well
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
how that works um but in the end
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the end won't the finance committee
 
01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.870 align:start position:0%
in the end won't the finance committee
budget

01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
the budget that will be published by the
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh it'll be hb1 as amended
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
by the finance committee be lower
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
than hb1 as it was introduced
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
which was the governor's budget
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
and as i heard yesterday
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
representative weiler talked about
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think it was 70 million dollars that
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we we need to um
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
look for reductions in the governor's
 
01:59:02.639 --> 01:59:03.830 align:start position:0%
look for reductions in the governor's
budget

01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
um and he
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
laid out how they might be divided in
 
01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
division one having some division two
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
and division three having some place in
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood of a 50
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
50 to 55 million
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
reduction so in the end won't we
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
see published a
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
budget from the finance committee that
 
01:59:29.599 --> 01:59:30.550 align:start position:0%
budget from the finance committee that
actually

01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
is lower than what the governor brought
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
i i'm going to leave that conclusion to
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
to kind of the statement of the obvious
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
that you just made but
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
i would just tell you that i see it very
 
01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:50.790 align:start position:0%
i would just tell you that i see it very
differently

01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing that we have a current year
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
budget that's almost 24
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
greater than the higher budget that
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
preceded it
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that we're going to use that
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
baseline of fi 21 and we're going to
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
grow it
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
more in the division three
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the finance committee
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
it won't reach as much spending as the
 
02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:18.070 align:start position:0%
it won't reach as much spending as the
governor's

02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
budget has proposed because as you said
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
we fundamentally are dealing with a
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
lower revenue estimate than the governor
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
and it isn't that we wouldn't spend it
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
is the same amount of money in the same
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
way as the governor
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's just that our rules don't allow us
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
to do that so so i
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
i choose to characterize what we're
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
doing is we're taking a current budget
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
which is greater than what the
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
department has been able to absorb in
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
the first place which
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
if they went from where they are right
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
now on the 11th of march
 
02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
forward to the end of the year they'll
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
never get anywhere near
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
the fy 21 budget
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
so just if we used fy21 it's still
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
growth from where they're at and we're
 
02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
not going to be satisfied with that
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to take that growth that's
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
still there
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
and we're going to add potential growth
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the to the tune of about 90 to 100
 
02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.070 align:start position:0%
in the to the tune of about 90 to 100
million

02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
roughly split you know one-third
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
in fy22 and two-thirds in fy
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
23. so
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry i'm not just giving you yes
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
or no to the way you frame
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
the question but i hopefully my answer
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you i i this is just one this is
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
just a technical question and probably
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
maybe for kevin um are we going to be
 
02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:51.189 align:start position:0%
maybe for kevin um are we going to be
having

02:01:51.189 --> 02:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
the document that you shared with us
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
yesterday is that going to be
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
um available to the public is it going
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
well i i think i told him yesterday that
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
because it's an internal working
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
document at this point
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
and that it's based so strongly on fy21
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
that i didn't see a need for it to be a
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
publicly shared document because it's
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
like in
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
in progress work notes it's it's not
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
our proposal when when division three
 
02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:24.950 align:start position:0%
our proposal when when division three
votes

02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
votes
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
in a week or so uh our proposal is going
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
about a hundred million dollars more
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
than this working document
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
shows if if the if the community wants
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
input and feedback they can
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
look at the fy 21 existing budget
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and tell us what they think about
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
the fy 21 budget
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
and how they think it should uh change
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
between now and the end of fy23
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
now that's that's how i view it if
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
the lba in consultation with all the
 
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
right to know people think
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
that this working document that's not
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
gonna it's gonna change daily anyways
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh needs to be uh hung on the website
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm okay with that i i just think it's
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
gonna cause more confusion than it's
 
02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:19.350 align:start position:0%
gonna cause more confusion than it's
worth

02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
worth
 
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
so so since i just answered the question
 
02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
why don't you tell me the real answer mr
 
02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.669 align:start position:0%
why don't you tell me the real answer mr
ripple

02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
ripple
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
well the real answer is we haven't
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
really come to a conclusion yet
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
um i did discuss it with mike kane and
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
he said that since it was a working
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
document there was no need to put it on
 
02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
the website
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
but uh it doesn't have to stop there i
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
could contact
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
house counsel i could contact others to
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
decide what they think our
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
so just just because i think it's
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
really important to all of us to be
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
transparent to the to the
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
public would you would you please pursue
 
02:03:56.719 --> 02:03:57.189 align:start position:0%
public would you would you please pursue
that

02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
to the next level of uh legal review
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment question still
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
well i still think there are pub
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
there are people out there in the public
 
02:04:11.679 --> 02:04:12.550 align:start position:0%
there are people out there in the public
um

02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people in this state
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
who follow the budget
 
02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
very closely they know different
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
sections of it
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think they are going to be confused by
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
this um
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
by this new way of operating here right
 
02:04:28.709 --> 02:04:28.719 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
and they need to at least have access to
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
seeing the document
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
and i do hope for sure that we are
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
sharing this with the department
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
because there are some serious
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
between using 21
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
the budget of 21 and not
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
the document that we have been using all
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
the way through and that
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
the department has been responding to
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
they've been responding to house bill
 
02:04:58.800 --> 02:04:59.510 align:start position:0%
they've been responding to house bill
one

02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget and what we're i
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
mean it sounds like what's happening
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
here is we're saying
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
we're not going to use the governor's
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
budget we're just going to set that
 
02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:07.669 align:start position:0%
budget we're just going to set that
aside

02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
aside
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
we have a different document we're going
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
to use that we're going to build from
 
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
um and i just i just think we need to be
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody's got the same tools
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
to be working with
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you and i
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
i hope that um all of us
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
can understand the concept that we're
 
02:05:27.199 --> 02:05:28.149 align:start position:0%
can understand the concept that we're
using

02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
using
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
and can help explain it to the public so
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we dampen any confusion
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly standard budgeting
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
process from my experience
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
where if you have to do a budget you
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
take a look at your existing budget
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
and you make changes from your existing
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
budget i think that's pretty standard
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't see a tremendous value
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
in using the governor's budget because
 
02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:53.510 align:start position:0%
in using the governor's budget because
we'll

02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
we'll never have enough money to feed
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
so so let's focus on what we can control
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
which is growth from
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
i just have could i just make one more
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
comment yes ma'am we're having a
 
02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:10.790 align:start position:0%
comment yes ma'am we're having a
conversation

02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
i i just i guess it's i've been around a
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
long time so
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's hard to for uh someone
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
who's done it
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
one way to make that change um
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
but you know the department has a depart
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's a department
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
process that took place starting last
 
02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
process that took place starting last
summer

02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
summer
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
and they proposed what they felt
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
was appropriate for the departments
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
and for them doing their work they
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
propose that the governor
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
then there's the governor's phase and he
 
02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:49.589 align:start position:0%
then there's the governor's phase and he
then

02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
or she um does a lot of a lot of work on
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
the budget and comes forth with
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
house with the governor's budget
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i i i'm worried that a lot of that
 
02:07:01.199 --> 02:07:01.830 align:start position:0%
and i i i'm worried that a lot of that
work

02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
is just being set aside and we've just
 
02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:05.750 align:start position:0%
is just being set aside and we've just
spent

02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
spent
 
02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
and we've just spent three to four weeks
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
using house bill one
 
02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
and house bill 2 as they were presented
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
to us
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
as how we've gathered all our
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
information so it's just
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the process like this to
 
02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:21.910 align:start position:0%
at the end of the process like this to
be

02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
um given a whole new document to work
 
02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:26.310 align:start position:0%
um given a whole new document to work
from

02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of pla there are a lot
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
of people here not just
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
not just the people on division three
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
who might division three might be able
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
to handle doing this but i think there's
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of other people
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
that um have a lot of have a lot of
 
02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:42.550 align:start position:0%
that um have a lot of have a lot of
concern

02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
about how the budget comes out i
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
i think we're all extremely concerned
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
how the governors or how this budget
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
process works out and that we all want
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
the best division three budget that we
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
can produce
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
and we i think all of us have
 
02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
unanimously accepted the idea
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
that we don't have as much revenue to
 
02:08:02.719 --> 02:08:03.189 align:start position:0%
that we don't have as much revenue to
put

02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
put
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
into the budget growth as the governor
 
02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:06.550 align:start position:0%
into the budget growth as the governor
did

02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
so ultimately everyone who's been
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
involved in this process
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis since last july
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
probably already knew a long time ago
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
that the division three
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
product was going to be at a different
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
level than what the governor's process
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
led them to so i i don't think we're
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
springing any surprises on anyone
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh nordgren your hand
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
has been up the longest i think
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
02:08:39.119 --> 02:08:41.350 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
um

02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
i think what we need i uh one question i
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
had was a process question
 
02:08:48.870 --> 02:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
are the other divisions doing the same
 
02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
thing are they
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
are they writing their own budget too or
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
are we the only division doing this well
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
as i understand division one and
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
division two uh
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
their numbers are going to come up
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere between
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
fy 21 and the governor's proposal
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
so the the their end result they're
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
going to get to the same result that
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh that we will we will be between
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
fy 21 and the governor's proposal
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
because all of us have less revenue than
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
what the governor was
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
able to use in his assumptions
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
but in reality division
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
three is writing a whole new budget
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
of their own are the other divisions
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
rewriting the governor's budget
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
line for line i guess i don't agree
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
with your characterization because we're
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
using an existing fy 21 baseline
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
and we're adding back hb4 we're using
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
real numbers
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
that have been really approved by the
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
the prior
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
majority as as the process has been
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
described to me
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh being in the minority could mean uh
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
having the majority show up with a
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
budget on the last day
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
and and not allowing the minority to
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
participate in it
 
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
and just taking a vote and and pushing
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
it through
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
based on numbers and i
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
am attempting a a very what i think is a
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
very collaborative process it's a very
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
transparent process
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
when i think an alternative approach
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
would be to spring a budget at the last
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
minute and call a vote and and
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
let the the vote to decide what we're
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
so we got a document from representative
 
02:10:50.719 --> 02:10:51.990 align:start position:0%
so we got a document from representative
earth

02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
earth
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
that was i think 80 pages and what it
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
showed was
 
02:11:00.750 --> 02:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
22 and 23
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
and every line
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
was the same so the second year of the
 
02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:10.950 align:start position:0%
was the same so the second year of the
budget

02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
in every line is the same as the first
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh year of the budget so are
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
are we going to be going through every
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
line of the budget
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
or i guess i don't understand how you
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
write a new budget we've never really
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
written a new budget before so
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
so again i don't agree with the
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
characterization that's new budget it's
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
the fy
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
21 budget with the add backs of hb4 for
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
full transparency
 
02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
and then what since we're using the
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
working document
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
we we had an algorithm that got us to
 
02:11:48.599 --> 02:11:50.149 align:start position:0%
we we had an algorithm that got us to
fy22

02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
fy22
 
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
and because it's a working document we
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
said okay for now just carry fy23 is the
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
same number as fy22
 
02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
but we all know we're going to add back
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh money and that we have money
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh to the tune of 90 to 100 million
 
02:12:04.079 --> 02:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
uh to the tune of 90 to 100 million
dollars

02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
of which in the first year 22 we can add
 
02:12:08.079 --> 02:12:08.470 align:start position:0%
of which in the first year 22 we can add
back

02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
around 30 percent a third of it and two
 
02:12:11.199 --> 02:12:11.750 align:start position:0%
around 30 percent a third of it and two
thirds

02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
thirds
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
in the second year so so
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
by the time we get done we will probably
 
02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:18.229 align:start position:0%
by the time we get done we will probably
uh

02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
have in every line growth between 22 and
 
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.390 align:start position:0%
have in every line growth between 22 and
23.

02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
23.
 
02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
so so will you pick a number
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
um an amount of money that we can add
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
back in
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
and lba will keep track of that
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
and subtract each day how much money
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're putting back
 
02:12:44.550 --> 02:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
in or how does that process work
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
i think it's a working document and a
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
bunch of
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
the add back-ends we can kind of keep
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
track of as ourselves with ourselves
 
02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.270 align:start position:0%
track of as ourselves with ourselves
because

02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know we can use an excel sheet and
 
02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
figure it out
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
but but the lba will be
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
receiving um regular updates
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i will try to distinguish for mr
 
02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:11.510 align:start position:0%
and i will try to distinguish for mr

02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
ripple
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know which accounts are ready to be
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
locked in and
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the result of some of
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
the votes we're going to take like for
 
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.030 align:start position:0%
the votes we're going to take like for
example

02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday we decided that we would ask
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
to give us all of the accounts
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
that had federal mon funds only and
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to vote
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
to i think to accept
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget on those federal
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
lines and that'll put
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
a portion of the work away as we go
 
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
through the budget and the few remaining
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
work days that we have
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to agree on some
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
areas like you know i think
 
02:13:54.629 --> 02:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
i think we probably are are all
 
02:13:56.790 --> 02:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
very close to agreeing on the veterans
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
home and
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
glencliff for example you know
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
and i forget exactly like if you will
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
tell us what line
 
02:14:06.550 --> 02:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
the health equity line was that you that
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
you suggested that we
 
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
we agreed to uh we probably
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
will agree to your proposals
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
i do want this to be collegial i do want
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
your input reflected
 
02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
i do want this to be a transparent
 
02:14:20.239 --> 02:14:21.430 align:start position:0%
i do want this to be a transparent
process

02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
i do realize that there's an alternative
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
where we could spring something on you
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
at the last moment and just
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
go straight to a vote and i don't want
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
i i just worry that the public will be
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
totally left out of this not knowing
 
02:14:40.629 --> 02:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
today when they testify
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
that they're testifying on hopefully
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
having their
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
certain line item put back in the budget
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
because now
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
these things are already in the budget
 
02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative rogers your hand has been
 
02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.669 align:start position:0%
representative rogers your hand has been
up

02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
um i in fairness representative erf's
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
hand was up before mine but i'm happy to
 
02:15:18.239 --> 02:15:19.270 align:start position:0%
hand was up before mine but i'm happy to
go

02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
um i have a few questions if we're
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
bringing in
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
written amendments should they be worded
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
to amend the document house bill won or
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
should they be worded
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
to amend the um representative
 
02:15:36.149 --> 02:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
document that he gave to us those lines
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
how do we want to do that
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
so if you're if you're amending hb2 uh
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
we have a schedule that we've shared
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
which sections we're going to talk about
 
02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
in on on each day
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
um right on hospital one okay if you
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
haven't proposed amendments on
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not actually sure exactly how that
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
level of detail works
 
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
i have imagined what we would do is we
 
02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:08.950 align:start position:0%
i have imagined what we would do is we
would

02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
be talking as a committee division three
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
off of an excel document and deciding on
 
02:16:15.679 --> 02:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
off of an excel document and deciding on
hb1

02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
02:16:20.069 --> 02:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
how we want to invest the resources we
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
have available
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
so you're not going to require written
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
amendments we could just talk about them
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
i i want this to be a collaborative
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
process and i think
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
discussion and brainstorming is best
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
done if we've got a
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
live excel sheet and and that and then
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
if we can get comfortable
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we've resourced it properly
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
at that point i'd turn it over to mr
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
ripple and say please
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
make this an amendment and and then
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're ready to vote because we've
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
already had the discussion
 
02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to make sure how you
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
the other concern that i have is um and
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
perception is sometimes reality but my
 
02:16:58.559 --> 02:16:59.190 align:start position:0%
perception is sometimes reality but my
concern

02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
is that um when we come out with the
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
document that
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
um your your yours and represent earth's
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
document as our proposed budget
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
um and we're not any longer using house
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill one
 
02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
um that your explanation needs to be
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit um clearer
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
because i fear that the public will will
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
look at this as somewhat of an
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
obfuscation and i'm not saying it is i'm
 
02:17:26.399 --> 02:17:27.030 align:start position:0%
obfuscation and i'm not saying it is i'm
saying

02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
perception because the document has not
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
been released to the public
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you and urge mr ripple
 
02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:35.270 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you and urge mr ripple
that

02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
to err on the side of caution um and to
 
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
as i i understand you're saying the
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
document will change rapidly
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
but releasing it to the public could go
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
a long way
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
now to reducing anything in the future
 
02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
of people saying that it's an
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
obfuscation or ability to hide or the
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
last minute
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
if the sooner they they have that
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
document even if it is going to change
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
rapidly then you take away any kind of
 
02:18:00.639 --> 02:18:01.509 align:start position:0%
rapidly then you take away any kind of
um

02:18:01.509 --> 02:18:01.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
possible people saying they didn't have
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
it they didn't know it was there and so
 
02:18:05.599 --> 02:18:06.070 align:start position:0%
it they didn't know it was there and so
forth

02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
forth
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you to err on the the
 
02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
side of caution
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
by releasing it and putting it on the
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
website at least
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see where it's a problem that
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
anybody sees it
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
um even if it might be out of date the
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
minute you put it on there
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
at least it's there that people see the
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
document we're working off of at one
 
02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:25.830 align:start position:0%
document we're working off of at one
point

02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
um my grandfather always said the only
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
thing that does well in the dark is
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
cockroaches so
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
um i think it might be helpful to put it
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
on there so that people can see what
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
we're working off of
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
and just because then people won't
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
when they can't see something is when
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
people complain and put all kinds of um
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
people's motives for doing it that's
 
02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:47.669 align:start position:0%
people's motives for doing it that's
just

02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes so so i've found that
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
you can never communicate perfectly to
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
100 of the people anyways and people who
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
choose to
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
look at something negatively or that's
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to exercise that choice
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
but i just want to put the next eight
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
days into context
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
the eight in the next eight days is a
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
tiny drop of time between
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
when the fy 21 budget was approved
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
two years ago and hb4 got approved on
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
top of it
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
the the working document that we're
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
using does us a favor
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
by taking that hb 21 existing budget
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's been out there for two years
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
and merging into it the hb4 items that
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
have also have been out there for a
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
so it gives us visibility into what's
 
02:19:41.349 --> 02:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
been there for two years
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
when we finish our work in eight days
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
it's we're nowhere near done the state's
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
nowhere near done
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
our division three work will go to a
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
full finance committee
 
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
a week or so later where uh public
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
comment can be reached
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh then the from the finance committee
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
it goes to the whole house
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
if the whole house passes it it goes to
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
the senate and goes through all of this
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
process all over again
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then it goes into the committee a
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
conference which is probably
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
more in the dark than anything we're
 
02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:17.910 align:start position:0%
more in the dark than anything we're
doing

02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
in in the next eight days everything we
 
02:20:21.439 --> 02:20:22.070 align:start position:0%
in in the next eight days everything we
do

02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be broadcast live
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
so so in terms of transparency of the
 
02:20:28.399 --> 02:20:28.790 align:start position:0%
so so in terms of transparency of the
work

02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
performance over the next eight days i
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
i i think we're going to be extremely
 
02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:35.030 align:start position:0%
i i think we're going to be extremely
transparent

02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
and because i agree with your point you
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
know things don't
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know sunshine is the best
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
disinfectant so
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
that did that address your concerns
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
maybe i
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
not in the way you wanted me to but i
 
02:20:48.479 --> 02:20:49.590 align:start position:0%
not in the way you wanted me to but i
think

02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
what do you think i just think the more
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
you put in the public view the better
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i would urge you to
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
put the document in public thank you
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you i have a lot of
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
work in the next eight days and things
 
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
are going to be changing so much
 
02:21:06.389 --> 02:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
that it it actually in reality is
 
02:21:06.399 --> 02:21:07.590 align:start position:0%
that it it actually in reality is
impossible

02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
to communicate to everyone exactly what
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
the existing
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
status is in the instant so i i don't
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it's even an
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
achievable objective to
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
to be fully transparent as we're talking
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
to one another beyond
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
doing this representative erf do you
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
comment emmy
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have a very
 
02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:33.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have a very
different

02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
perspective i view this process as being
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
very similar to what we went through
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
two years ago the only confusion that's
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
been created in the public's eye is what
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
our committee is creating
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
i fully expect the people testifying
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon which hopefully
 
02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
get there in time would speak to the
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
that that's what i would be doing that's
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
what i would expect them to be doing i
 
02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:55.110 align:start position:0%
what i would expect them to be doing i
don't

02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely would work perfectly
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you looked at the document that i
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
provided you'll notice that
 
02:22:03.429 --> 02:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
i've simply i've noted where the
 
02:22:03.439 --> 02:22:05.190 align:start position:0%
i've simply i've noted where the
government's

02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
government's
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
elements have picked up in the
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
underlying document
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
and we as the chairman has mentioned
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
we've already or we're planning to vote
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
on a whole bunch of accounts
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
soon that will pick up the governor's
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
part of the budget
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
i don't view the there be any more work
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
for the lba
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
why would they be doing anything until
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
we pick
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
we tell them they'll tell them what
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
particular account is going to hold is
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
it going to hold the governor's numbers
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
is it going to hold budget 21 numbers is
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
going to hold
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
other numbers i recall going through and
 
02:22:38.319 --> 02:22:38.870 align:start position:0%
other numbers i recall going through and
changing

02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
changing
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
many of the governor's numbers many of
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
the governor's numbers two years ago
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
and that was all after the public
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
hearings so
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
the public comes and they tell us what
 
02:22:49.750 --> 02:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
they do what like about the governor
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
what they don't like about the governor
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
we're just basically looking at it from
 
02:22:54.399 --> 02:22:54.790 align:start position:0%
we're just basically looking at it from
a

02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
from a different starting point i guess
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
you could view it that way because we
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
have to reduce
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago it was all about
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
increasing it was a different
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
a different role that we were
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that we were taking i guess i don't see
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
the need to
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
post this budget it's not a budget it
 
02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
simply shows two different perspectives
 
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
and how they can be
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
combined it doesn't say that this is how
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
they are combined
 
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
so we will basically be able to pick and
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
choose and we can pick a third way just
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
as two years ago
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
we often picked a third way it just
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
happened that two years ago
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
it typically was a much higher way than
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
this year we have to go lower so
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know why you want to confuse
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
people about look at some other
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
thing that what they're thinking about
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
let's not imply intent
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative earth we we we're not
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
even hiding
 
02:23:50.950 --> 02:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're just hearing questions from from
 
02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:51.590 align:start position:0%
we're just hearing questions from from
everyone

02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
but we let's not assume that we know
 
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
what their intent is
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay i apologize what would i use i've
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
been planning time i didn't need to
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
i take it back and honestly i'm not
 
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
trying to imply intent i'm just i know
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
i just just trying to keep it you know
 
02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:07.910 align:start position:0%
i just just trying to keep it you know
collegial

02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
collegial
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
well i'm just listening to the
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
discussion having been through this
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
myself two years ago
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't see the points that are
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
being made
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
being different from what it was two
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
other than i understand what we're
 
02:24:22.469 --> 02:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
starting from two years ago they started
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
we started from a different place but
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
from the public's perspective
 
02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's always the governor's budget okay
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'll just stop i guess

i just i have one i just have one
 
02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
further question and i'd just be
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
interested to know
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
um have has this new way of doing the
 
02:24:53.439 --> 02:24:54.550 align:start position:0%
um have has this new way of doing the
budget

02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh been discussed with the governor is
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's office aware
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
of um how we're going to proceed because
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the past when the governor's office
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
really involved in watching the house
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
and working with the house around the
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
budget so i just wondered if
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
if the governor's office has been
 
02:25:15.359 --> 02:25:16.309 align:start position:0%
if the governor's office has been
actively

02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
actively
 
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
participating in uh this new way of
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
so so two folks from
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
the governor's office accepted our
 
02:25:26.479 --> 02:25:27.349 align:start position:0%
the governor's office accepted our
invitation

02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
invitation
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
to talk to uh the division iii
 
02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:31.030 align:start position:0%
to talk to uh the division iii
leadership

02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
about i don't know it's been three weeks
 
02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:34.150 align:start position:0%
about i don't know it's been three weeks
ago

02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
and one of them is in the attendees now
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
as i've watched over the
 
02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
last uh few days it seems like one or
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
both of them have always been in the
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
attendees list
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
we i made an overt request
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
for them to participate in our process
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
and the the essence of the answer i got
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
back was that the governor thinks
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to have more revenue we've
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
based our budget
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
on that revenue estimate and
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
the house you have a different process
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
because you use different revenue
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
numbers and
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
we are in no position to help you figure
 
02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:15.990 align:start position:0%
we are in no position to help you figure
out

02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
what numbers you're going to use other
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
than the governor's numbers so
 
02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
so so requests were made
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
assistance was not
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it there so to answer
 
02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
your question
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
i think the governor's office knows
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're doing and why we're
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
doing it and they were invited
 
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
invited to participate as assertively as
 
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
they wanted to
 
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yes ma'am
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
i think at this point we have to go
 
02:26:51.270 --> 02:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
because some of us
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
need to get to conquer um and
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm not seeing any hands up in the
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
attendees or
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
in amongst the committee members um
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
i i just would assure you as
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues i've always expected that
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
we're not going to agree
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
on the final numbers but i
 
02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
have always wanted to have this being a
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
very open
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
very transparent and very collegial
 
02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:20.870 align:start position:0%
very transparent and very collegial
process

02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
with with everyone and and today
 
02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh i think we maintain that even though
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
we can start to see that we have
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
different viewpoints on
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
on the way things should be so so i
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate everyone's
 
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
courtesy and i apologize if i was
 
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
a little tenser than i should be so um
 
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
not seeing any further comments i
 
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
think we're adjourned and then wait a
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
second before we adjourn
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
what we're getting together at one
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock today obviously
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
but then we have a budget work session
 
02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:58.150 align:start position:0%
but then we have a budget work session
tomorrow

02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
where we've scheduled talking about
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
sections 21
 
02:28:05.349 --> 02:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
23 24 25 28 and then
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
um i have a note here lapse rates kevin
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
do you do you know what that note means
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i think that meant you were
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
going to tell us about
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
teach us another time one more bite at
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
the apple
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
on how lapse rates get factored into
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
the the budgets so that so if we say
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars but you have to lapse
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh 50 million dollars you know what how
 
02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
that has worked historically
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
i think i think it's a tutorial sure
 
02:28:42.790 --> 02:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
sounds good
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right so uh i'll see you all
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
shortly uh with that today's
