to our hearing today thank you chairman
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
lad and good afternoon to you all as
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
well and to everyone in this room in the
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
Overflow of rooms as well for the record
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Valerie McDonnell I represent
 
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.039 align:start position:0%
my friends and Neighbors in my hometown
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
of Salem which is Rockingham District 25
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
and I am the prime sponsor of the bill
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
before you which is House Bill 115
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
FN I brought this legislation forward
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons primarily to
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
fund students not systems to ensure
 
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
educational attainment is not limited
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
due to a student's income or zip code
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
which are both beyond the child's
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
control and to make strides upon what
 
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
was accomplished during a committee of
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
conference over the summer I served on
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
that committee along with a number of
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
you as well and as well as members of
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
the other body feeling that the final
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
report was too much of a compromise from
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
the original House position the house
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
ultimately voted not to accept the
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
report and as a result of that committee
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
no changes were made to the statutes
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
regarding education Freedom accounts
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 115 FN would change the
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
statute but only slightly the only
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
change is to strike income limitations
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
from the eligibility requirements which
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
effectively removes less than a sentence
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
from current law the English teachers
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
Among Us May note that the bill attempts
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
to repeal a depending Clause from
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
current law however this modest bill
 
00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
will have significant benefits for
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
example every New Hampshire family would
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
be empowered to choose an educational
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
setting that best fits their needs and
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
is most conducive to their child's
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
learning current EFA participants attend
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
non-public homeschooling and even public
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
education options such as our wonderful
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
public charter schools two of which are
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
located within my district but service
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
students across the granite
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
state additionally and I seldom hear
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
this point mentioned EF are permitted to
 
00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
be spent on testing fees this enables
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
participants to take exams for college
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
credit such as AP or advanced placement
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
exams these exams which are administered
 
00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:43.519 align:start position:0%
by the college board can be costly the
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
current cost ranges from $99 to
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
$147 per exam and considering students
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
often take multiple AP exams and
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
families often have multiple students
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
taking these exams it can become a large
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
financial burden however these exams do
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
make higher education not only more
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
affordable but also more attainable and
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
as a result there would be less of a
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
need to debate other issues in
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
committees such as this like loan
 
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
forgiveness because there'll be less of
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
a need for students to take out loans
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I can personally attest to the
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
benefits the AP program which combined
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
with dual enrollment allowed me to
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
complete College in half the time and at
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
a fraction of the cost and hb15 appn
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
would afford every student the same
 
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.549 align:start position:0%
would afford every student the same
opportunity

00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
furthermore the EFA program is both
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
wildly successful and wildly popular
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
notably 72% of K through 12 parents
 
00:28:37.399 --> 00:28:38.509 align:start position:0%
notably 72% of K through 12 parents
support

00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
esas and 69% of those students support
 
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.830 align:start position:0%
esas and 69% of those students support
Universal

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
esas I mention esas or education savings
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
accounts which is a term used in other
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
states for the sake of
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
comparison recently arizonans passed
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
Universal esas in their state and a new
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
report suggests that the resulting
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
expenditures came in under budget and
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
the same can be true in New Hampshire
 
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
and that report is provided to each of
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
you uh for specifics I do direct you to
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
the attached fiscal note on the bill
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
where the legislative budget assistant
 
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
estimated the average EF gr a grant If
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
This Were to pass to be
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
$441 19 per student and on the other
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
hand the Department of Education through
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
their I platform software checked this
 
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.669 align:start position:0%
their I platform software checked this
morning

00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
estimates the average cost per pupil to
 
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.830 align:start position:0%
estimates the average cost per pupil to
be

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
$23,995 and that amount keeps increasing
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
year to year so I said something to the
 
00:29:40.509 --> 00:29:40.519 align:start position:0%
English teachers now to the Math
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
teachers in the room you may note that
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
4,419 subtracted from
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
$1,580 which is an extreme tax
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
savings also under current law when a
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
family's income is assessed to determine
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
if they qualify the efaa program their
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
expenses are not considered this was
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention by chrisy who is
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
a mother of two young children in
 
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
Swansea after an intensive search for
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
the right fit her children are learning
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that meets their special needs
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
having an annual income over the current
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
limit the family has been self-
 
00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:21.710 align:start position:0%
limit the family has been self-
financing

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
financing
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
this unfortunately Christy's husband was
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
recently diagnosed with terminal brain
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
cancer specifically stage for gleo
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
blastoma and as a result of paying for
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
Cancer Treatments the family's expenses
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
have dramatically increased and as a
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
result they can no longer afford their
 
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.310 align:start position:0%
result they can no longer afford their
children's

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
children's
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
education the option that was finally
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
working for her children the couple are
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers they're small business owners
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
and several years ago they decided to
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
make New Hampshire their new home so
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
needless to say they contribute to the
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire community and don't
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
deserve to choose between paying for
 
00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.629 align:start position:0%
deserve to choose between paying for
cancer

00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:02.919 align:start position:0%
treatment and to educate their special
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
needs children at your leisure I
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
encourage you to read christe's
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
testimony which is in front of each of
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
you however I will note that it was
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
difficult not to be moved to tears when
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
I spoke with Christie twice this week in
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
the provided testimony you will also
 
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
hear the story of Amy from Auburn who
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
says an EFA allowed her son to read at
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
grade level and catch up with his peers
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
Renee from Troy she cites that her
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
children's efas are Miracles and Hannah
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
from antrum credits an EFA with saving
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
the life of her daughter who
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately experienced sexual
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
assault these are just excerpts of a few
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the testimonies supported submitted
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill 115 FN and
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
there is more testimony in front of you
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
and available digitally including from
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
each of your
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
constituencies I find myself reading
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
through these testimon again and again
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
they remind me of the reason that I am
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
here which is to help
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
people many of the stories in front of
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
you which I encourage you to read when
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
you get the chance are from parents and
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
Educators alike and they are crying out
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
to us for help isn't that our job as
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
legislators to help them after all if we
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
don't help our constituents meet their
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
educational needs then what are we doing
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
here thank you and I'm happy to take any
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
any questions for the
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative yes yes represent
 
00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
luno uh thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
McDonald for uh for bringing forward
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
this um this bill um just um um it's
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's really one question but it's it
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's tied to your some of the comments
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
you made and your your opening remarks
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
you you talk about this being a um um
 
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
just a slight change compared to
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
existing law so I just want to make sure
 
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh I understand where you're going with
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
that I believe existing law um uh has
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
the program providing vouchers and by
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
the way I'm using the term vouchers
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
because I know some states call them
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
efas some states call them esas some
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
states may use other terms as well but
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
vouchers I think is the universally
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
generic term for programs like this but
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
um but uh currently under state law uh
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire will provide uh
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
vouchers to um to students who who are
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
in families earning up to 350% of the
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
poverty guideline and that's about um
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
right right at the um the median
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
household income Statewide so by
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
removing the income cap this bill and I
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I get this right
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
because you're talking about a slight
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
change this bill would make these
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
vouchers available to families making
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
well above the uh median household uh
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
income uh am I correct in that thank you
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
for the question representative And in
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
regards to a slight change I was
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
referring to the language of the bill
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
itself and if you were to look the bill
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
not including the fiscal note is less
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
than a page I'm referring specifically
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
to lines 4 through 8 where you notice
 
00:34:16.839 --> 00:34:18.109 align:start position:0%
to lines 4 through 8 where you notice
that

00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
literally par of a sentence is crossed
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
off not an entire sentence as regard to
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
the change the 350% of the federal
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
poverty guidelines that is a figure
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
given to us by the federal government
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's a guideline used for a number of
 
00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
programs that's not controlled within
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um that number so that number
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
could change but currently for a family
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
and so in regards to a slight change I
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
was referring atmology to the language
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
within the bill
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill would expand it to all am
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
regardless of income because currently
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
other factors as I mentioned such as
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
expenses are not included okay and
 
00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:08.839 align:start position:0%
follow follow we're going to try to stay
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
with from followup so if you can ask a
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
quick question it's G to be real Qui
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
tied tied to that so the answer is yes I
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
I believe I I characterize it correct
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
the existing law and the what's being
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
proposed here and then in terms of the
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
modest um nature of this bill and that's
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
another term you used when when opening
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
the the program up to families earning
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh above and well above the um the the
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
med Statewide median household income
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking at at Cost growing by more
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
than $100 million a year isn't uh isn't
 
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.790 align:start position:0%
than $100 million a year isn't uh isn't
that

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
correct I would not agree with those
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
cost estimates I do have in front of you
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
provided from the Arizona State where
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
they are a universal State their
 
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
programs structured a little bit
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
different than ours but their cost
 
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
estimates were seen a little bit
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
differently um And in regards to the
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
term modest I do think it's only a
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
modest request that every child has an
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
education that meets their needs I don't
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
think that's asking for too much for a
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
student um and I hope that answers your
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you very much
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you um you made a comment
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
that there was a tax savings you
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
referred to the 20,000 or so cost
 
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
average cost of an education which
 
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
includes Revenue that came from federal
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
sources and local sources and state
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
sources and then you subtracted the
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
average cost of Education Freedom
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
account voucher and declared that was a
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
tax savings so I'm a little confused by
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
that because if the student it goes to
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
was already attending Pro school that's
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
not a tax savings to taxpayers or the
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
state that's an expenditure for the
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
state and if the student you have a
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
question you need in form of a question
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
and if the student was in public school
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
then they will lose some of their
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid so can you explain to me
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
exactly who's saving taxes here to
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
clarify the figure I was citing is on
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
the Doe's website if you go to their I
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
platform click on I report the number is
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
right there and that's
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
$3,999 as of this morning when I
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
checked and in reference to the savings
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
I am referring specifically
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
to parents when they choose to put their
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
kid in an alternative education their
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
child that meets their needs the savings
 
00:37:51.359 --> 00:37:53.430 align:start position:0%
child that meets their needs the savings
is

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm struggling a little bit to
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
understand your question when you're
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
saying that students that are already in
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps a private school that that
 
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
because the the way the question is
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
worded with all respect implies that
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
that itself was not a choice and so for
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
that family there's tremendous savings
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
and at the moment you did mention Public
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
Schools we currently do have phase out
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
grants going to the public schools to
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
make up for any loss to that school that
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
they would receive an adequacy
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
aid thank you very
 
00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:28.839 align:start position:0%
much not yes repres
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
question would you support amending the
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
bill to require the the department of
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
education's contract with the children's
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
Scholarship Foundation which administers
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
the program include data sharing
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
requirements so that taxpayers in the
 
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
state have more complete information on
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
how the program is operated and the
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
funds are administered and so that the
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing audit of the program could be
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
accurately completed with all the data
 
00:38:56.599 --> 00:38:57.990 align:start position:0%
accurately completed with all the data
needed

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's nice to
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
see you again representative as for the
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund I do know
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
they have Representatives here so that
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
question may be better opposed to them
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
however as regarded in the EFA statutes
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
the third party that administers a
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
program which is currently the
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund is able to
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
operate the program and take 10% for
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
administrative fees it is my
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
understanding that the children's
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund is using far less
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
closer to seven or eight% for exact
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
percentage I would again refer to the
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund so that
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
reporting information is completely
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
available to the best of my
 
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.390 align:start position:0%
available to the best of my
knowledge

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair to be more clear
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
my question was not about the amount of
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
money paid to Children's Scholarship
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
Foundation to administer the program
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
although that's a separate concern my
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
question is about getting the
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
information on how the money is being
 
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
spent what it is that we are paying for
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
As taxpayers and we're not getting that
 
00:39:56.319 --> 00:39:59.470 align:start position:0%
As taxpayers and we're not getting that
information

00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
so the question is would you support
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
amending the bill to include a
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
requirement that full data sharing
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
happen from children's Scholarship
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
Foundation as the sole entity
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
administering this to provide complete
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
data to the Department of
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
Education I do know for a fact the
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
children's Scholarship Foundation on
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
their website does have a list of
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
regulated expenditures that are
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
permissible throughout the program and I
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
do know that it is monitored through an
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
application known as class wallet so all
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
expenses are double checked it's not
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
that a family can purchase something
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
without a separate check from the
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund from class
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
wallet and only from certified retailers
 
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
so it is my best understanding that that
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
information is already available if it's
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
the data sharing you're asking that
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be a question better directed to
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
the scholarship fund themselves thank
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
you no further question thank you very
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%

00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%

I am representative Wendy Thomas and I
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
represent the town of marac I'm here
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to HB 115 which
 
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
removes the income cap for the voucher
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
program uh mechanical error okay I was
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
say I just
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
started I had two seconds not two
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
minutes excuse me okay um the my
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
concerns with HB 115 include increased
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
costs for public fund funds the voucher
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
program often diverts money from public
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
schools which serve the majority of
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
students to private schools which serve
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
fewer students this can lead to unfunded
 
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
Public Schools larger class sizes
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
reduced programs and inadequate
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
resources for teachers and students
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
specifically in New Hampshire the
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
state's education Freedom account
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
program has significantly expanded
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
initially projected to cost
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
$130,000 the program exceeded 14.7
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
million in its second year far
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
surpassing early estimates this
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
shortfall means less funding for public
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
schools which still must educate the
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
majority of children increased local
 
00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:42.559 align:start position:0%
taxes when public funds are redirected
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
to P private schools local taxpayers are
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
often left to cover the Gap to maintain
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
Public School Services specifically in
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the EFA program is funded
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
through State dollars but as more
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
families opt out of public school
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
fixed costs like teacher salaries
 
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
transportation and Facilities remain
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
with less State funding municipalities
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
will need to raise property taxes to
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
make up the difference lack of oversight
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
and accountability private schools
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
accepting vouchers are often not held to
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
the same standards as public schools in
 
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
areas like curriculum teacher
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications and student performance
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
this can lead to inconsistent
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes specifically in New
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire private schools in the if EFA
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
program are not required to follow the

state's rigorous academic standards or
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%

public money to religious schools

ideologies specifically in New Hampshire
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%

through the

EFA program our religious
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
institutions was that really 2 minutes
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
that was 2 minutes all
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
right I'll I'll just give you my final
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
sentence voting against uh hb15 is one
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
of the most fiscally responsible actions
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
you can take for the New Hampshire
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%

right here you can see yes so uh
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee uh Mr
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
chairman my name is representative Heath
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
Howard I represent the towns of straford
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
and barington
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
and just like the overwhelming majority
 
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
of people I possibility for the state
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
and would operate as a tax subsidy for
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
the wealthy who are already sending
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
their kids to private school makes no
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
sense when we are seeing s serious
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
budgetary constraints in the formation
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
of the commission on government
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency under governor aot and that
 
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
we would pick up the tabs of people who
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
are willing and able to pay for these
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
Services it just seems rather
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
inefficient if you ask me every single
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
school in the state has minimum required
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
operating costs that they have to pay
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
for like heat water electricity
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
maintenance faculty staff and that's
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
before getting into things like books uh
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
lesson plans paper and printing costs my
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
point is is no matter how many kids
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
attend a school there are costs that
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
will remain the same no matter what and
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
removing These funds from already
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
struggling districts in order to uh
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
sorry uh in order to uh pay for people
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
who were previously paying private
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
tuition out of pocket will make it even
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
more difficult to cover base costs last
 
00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
year we failed to pass increases in
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy for both uh funding for both
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
General and special education and it was
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
found uh that we have a constitutional
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
obligation to act as ruled on by the
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
courts if anything the money we are
 
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
spending on this I would rather be spent
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
on special education because private
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
schools do not have to adhere to the
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
requirements of educating with people
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
with special needs and can ref refuse
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
service to individuals regardless of how
 
00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
you feel about the voucher program
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
itself we have a duty to fund public
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
education first and the state has been
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
failing to do that maybe we should
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
before funding private education for the
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
wealthiest in our state we should do the
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
bare minimum and fund public education
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
first thank you uh and no questions
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are no questions
 
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.190 align:start position:0%

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
particular would greatly benefit from
 
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
expanding the educational Freedom
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
account program over the course of the
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
summer I campaigned I did door-to-door
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
campaigning this family in particular it
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
was a father and a mother and when I
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
handed them my campaign card they saw
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
that I was in support of expanding
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom school choice now
 
00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
after talking with the family I learned
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
just how important the issue is to them
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
they have a son and now he's in high
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
school he goes to a private school here
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but a few years ago he
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
went to Rochester middle school and at
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
the time he was a a mediocre student not
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
a bad kid but just not the best student
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
and then the father shared with me that
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
the son was being sexually harassed in
 
00:47:57.309 --> 00:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
the boy's bathroom at as one would
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
imagine you you don't know how to
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
respond your heart breaks um you just
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what to say to them and later
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
on with talking with the father I
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
learned that he had to pull his kid from
 
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
the school you know the school wouldn't
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
do anything about it or couldn't do
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
anything about it but that was their
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
decision as a parent the worst part of
 
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
the story is that the father had to go
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
into debt to pull his kid from the
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
school and now like I said he goes to
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
private school and he's a a student and
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
most importantly his psychological
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
issues the emotional issues those are
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
gone I share this story because this
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
circumstance shows why there is a cause
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
and a need for the state to to increase
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom a parent shouldn't
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
have to go into debt for their son or
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
daughter to succeed thank you and no
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative like to call forward
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%

not going to do it two times uh
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you hello good morning
 
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
afternoon yes than to you uh honorable
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is Megan
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
Murray I represent the towns of Amherst
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
and Milford um and I'm here in
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 115 um as hb15
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of our commitment to
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
locally elected Public School boards
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
public education Educators and our
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
students the EFA voucher uh
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
wallet uh system has no legal
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
requirement to financially report to the
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed to our local boards
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
even though they may in uh do that from
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
time to time there's nothing in current
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
statute that says that they are required
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
to do so once those funds are dispersed
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
into these accounts um large amounts of
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
payments are going to these accounts
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
with our public taxpayer money um being
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
placed in those accounts without any uh
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
any real requirement to report those in
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
any real significant way back um the
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
other concern that I have is before we
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
consider opening these unlimited
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
expansions is that we're making sure
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
that we are um taking care of special
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
education needs this is another sort of
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
area and component to our education
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
especially in public education we have a
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
duty to ate all children um and it is
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
not clear to me through uh the vouchers
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
or the wallets whether that is happening
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
or not because we don't have that
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
information or data coming back to us um
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
our school boards do those things report
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
those things back to the state um though
 
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
we may have to travel over to another
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
third party management software site to
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
get this data there is nothing in
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
statute that is requiring that
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
information to come back to the state of
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for fiscal transparency
 
00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
and oversight um I am strongly uh
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
opposed on this on behalf of my
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
constituents uh thank you very much
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
from the you willing take questions no
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
I'm representative sah ORS represent
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
chiester and I just wanted to say as
 
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
people graduate a students graduate from
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
K to
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
12 they have choices they can go to
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth they can go to Southern New
 
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.910 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth they can go to Southern New
Hampshire

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
University they can go to MIT like some
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
of us in this room Arizona State you can
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
pick a place and they have that right to
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
go now why do they have choices why why
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
would they go to a different University
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
other than maybe a school here in New
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because probably that school
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
offers something that will benefit them
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
the most I'm a graduate of a Christian
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
University I why did I go to a Christian
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
University that was my choice that is
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
where I thought I would get the most
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
bang for the buck so why do we limit K
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
through 12 if we have parents that
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
believe that that their student would
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
perform better do better and it we' be
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
better for that student to go to a
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
different School whether it's the next
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
town Public School a chartered Public
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
School a Christian High School whatever
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
I don't see why we would want to limit
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
their choices and by the way I'm really
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
glad you got to see me today thank you
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
much like to invite representative
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon and thank
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Vlad and thank you to
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
the committee for having the hearing
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
today my name is Stephanie grund and I
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro County 34 which is
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
Amherst I'm here today to present my
 
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb15 there are many
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why and I'll be as brief as
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
possible impact on public school funding
 
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
there is an obligation to support public
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
education in our town
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
raising the voucher cap will divert
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
funds from public school especially in
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
underfunded districts has there been a
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
study to ensure that public schools will
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
continue to be funded
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately access to Quality
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
education vouchers are not adequately
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
addressing issues to of access to
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
families in lower inome neighborhoods
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
because they may lack the resources to
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
navigate the system or to travel to
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
other schools especially when they're
 
00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:52.839 align:start position:0%
not many choices near their Town raising
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
the income cap will all will just allow
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
more families that are already private
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
or religious schools to access the efas
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
the point of the efas was to ensure
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
students could leave the program they
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
are in and find a better pathway if a
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
student is already in a setting that
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
works for them then this money is not
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
for them they already made their choice
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
who is ensuring that students that are
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
receiving vouchers are being held to a
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
high standard of academic performance
 
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
are public schools regularly test and
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
Report the results to the doe one of the
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
reasons is to ensure schools are Mee the
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
standards of Education if Public Schools
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
who take public money are held to high
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
standard shouldn't any family that takes
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
public money in the form of vouchers be
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
held to the same standard before you
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
lift the income gap there should be a
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
requirement that all families taking
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
voucher money are taking the same tests
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
public school students are to ensure the
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
money is being used to properly educate
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
and produce adequate results in the
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
education it should not matter if a
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
student is attending a private religious
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
homeschool or other program there should
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
be a requirement for testing and
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
reporting to the doe to ensure students
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
are receiving the educ ation they
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
deserve as there has been no true audit
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
of the current company managing our
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
state efas there should be no money
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
flowing through into an audit is
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
performed I will again point out that
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
all public schools receive an audit by
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
an appropriate accounting firm can I
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
just finish or summarize it very Qui one
 
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.150 align:start position:0%
just finish or summarize it very Qui one
last

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
yes these results show that monies are
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
being used in accordance with laws and
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
that what is given to the public is
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
trusted but right now there's no way to
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
trust or show that current monies are
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
being handled legally let's keep the
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
standards the same thank you thank you
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
very much questions from the committee
 
00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:35.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'd like to invite
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
Horgan so I'm I'm representing Timothy
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
Horgan from straford County District 10
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
which is the town of town of Durham and
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
um I have some written testimony and
 
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
I've actually you ically seen it three
 
00:55:58.589 --> 00:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
times because I submitted it to the
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
portal I emailed it to everyone and I Ed
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
copies around but um anyway so the
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
program it's my opinion a fiscal Time
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
Bomb even in its current form and as
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
others mentioned it's ostensibly limited
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
to 350 standard federal poverty
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
guideline but in many case essentially
 
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
there already isn't a a uh limit because
 
00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
once a child qualifies here or she stays
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
qualified forever even the family's
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
income increases which would uh Norm be
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
the case given that most parents are in
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
the prime earning years at this time
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
when they're raising their children so
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
but this bill e in that limitation and
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
it OB we expect the per to go
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
dramatically so the fiscal note I just
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
don't you know it's rather vague I don't
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
trust it uh I don't trust it at all
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
um and I I think uh I I attached on the
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
back my printed Thing analis by a group
 
00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
called reaching higher in New Hampshire
 
00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:54.039 align:start position:0%
and I don't necessarily take that as
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
gospel but that's an extremely
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
conservative estimate just assuming the
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
number of private and homeschool
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
students doesn't increase which of
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
course it will increase and uh they say
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's 100 to 130 million so that's you
 
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
know it's really not affordable giving
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
the budget situation in our state and uh
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
anyway the program also is very poorly
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
designed it creates a huge entitlement
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
program turns over to a small private
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
organization with a little our oversight
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
um that's children's scholarship fund
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
which is based in New York City although
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
it does have a small office out in lowon
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
Road actually on the campus of a local
 
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
church and um which has raised another
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
problem with that organization which is
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's an a group for one typ or private
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
education I.E religious schools both
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
parochial Catholic schools and uh uh
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
Chris so-called christianis and the
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I think has been
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
very it's oversight has been extremely
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
ineffective um and designed the program
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
is almost impossible to audit anyway so
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
I think uh private I think this uh these
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
this is uh private schooling I think at
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
least at this time with our budget
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
situation should be funded with private
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
dollars which they're not evenly
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
distributed but they are very abundant
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
and uh our taxpayer dollars should be
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
saved for public schools so so that's
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
why and all them thank you very much
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you again and you'll be
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
hearing from me in a few weeks I have a
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
similar Bill uh about this I know you do
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks thank you uh representative
 
00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:35.549 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks thank you uh representative
stepen

00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
ring thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I'm a
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative from Manchester uh Ward
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
12 uh I received over 50 emails for this
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
uh in support of this bill today uh well
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
actually the last few days uh to support
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
the bill um I didn't receive any that
 
00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
would say not to support the bill but I
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
want to come to you from a different
 
00:58:57.309 --> 00:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
perspective uh being that I was an EFA
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
recipient uh and my daughter was in the
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
program I have a different perspective
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
on how it can actually help um being
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
that the EFA program was near and dear
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
to my heart after you know my daughter
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
went through it I was able to see how it
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
can help other families and I've seen
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
that a lot um not not to say that you
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
know the families that are in the
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
program uh would have chosen it if there
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't a different pathway for it like
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
with the esa and other programs but to
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
say that the expansion of this program
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
would be fiscally irresponsible is
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
something that you guys have to decide
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm telling you right now is that
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
it I think in in terms of the physical
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
side of what the kids are actually going
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
through right now in Manchester we have
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
26% efficiency scores according to the
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so the
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
conversation needs to change um not so
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
much I mean obviously fiscally
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
responsibly you need to discuss that and
 
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
how that works out but as far as the
 
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
children go we need to focus on that and
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's one of the thing that's lost uh
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
in Manchester I've seen that we've
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
increased uh about $14 million from the
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh hold Harless grants that were uh
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
given to the city of Manchester because
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
of the students the 852 students that
 
01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
have joined the program um that has
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
increased the funding of the city of
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester schools if you look at it and
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
that is something that's going to phase
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
out I believe in 2028 to 2030 so again
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
the argument is that the schools
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
definitely have to figure out how to be
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
able to manage their funding a little
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
bit better in their budget but there's
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
two sides to this that the education of
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
the children that I have firsthand
 
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
experience in uh can be far more
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
approved and again my daughter is signed
 
01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
up to speak to and she's going to speak
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
on this to let you see from a kid's
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
perspective um but beyond that I would
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
just say that uh I support the program
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
and I I wish that you would uh vote for
 
01:00:37.119 --> 01:00:38.630 align:start position:0%
and I I wish that you would uh vote for
it

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
timing any questions yes representa

Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for

make taking my question um you cited
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
that you had received 50 messages in
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
support of the bill from constituents
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
and zero opposing it are you aware that
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%

have submitted in support or in
 
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
opposition are

744 supporting the bill and
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
3,17 opposing the bill the Statewide
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
numbers are apparently quite different
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
from your
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
constituents I appreciate that and did
 
01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
not know that number until you just said
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
it um again I'm only doing what I have
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
from the emails that I get and again um
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
I encourage anybody that's listening or
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
watching to reach out to me tell me
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
their feelings and opinion about it if
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
you're in my district so thank
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
you not see yes represent Luna thanks
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair would um would you U
 
01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:47.799 align:start position:0%
possibly support an amendment um to this
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill that would require the state to
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
perform an annual audit on the uh the
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
performance of the program make sure
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
that it's compliant with um with with
 
01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
state laws the way other Public
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs are monitored in the
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
state to be perfectly honest with you I
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
haven't looked into that part of the
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill to understand what is already there
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing it now and I will do my due
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
diligence and look into it more to
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
understand it better so I guess that's a
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
question that I would better answered in
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
the future when I actually have time to
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
read that portion of what it currently
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
says in the law okay thank you thank you
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
further questions not seeing thank you
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
very much at this point there are still
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
five or six reps I want but I also have
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
some notices there that there are
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
several parent to have to be out of here

it thank you good afternoon my name is
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
Michaela Deiter for the record I serve
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
on the Dober school board and I'm also
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
on staff with the New Hampshire school
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
funding fairness project though today I
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
speak only for myself I oppose HB 115's
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
attempt to expand the voucher system in
 
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as I believe it represents
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
a spending decision our state simply
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to make an expanded
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
voucher program is a fiscally
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
irresponsible use of limited taxpayer
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
funds approximately 20% of Doper 300 500
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
students including my son received
 
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
special education services last year our
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
district submitted nearly $58 million of
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
special education Aid reimbursement
 
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
requests the state paid 1.53 million
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
less than 27% of what was submitted
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
forcing do taxpayers to make up the $4.2
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
million shortfall this Gap widens
 
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
annually as shown on the chart I've
 
01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.990 align:start position:0%
annually as shown on the chart I've
passed

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
around this negative this reality
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
negatively affects all community with
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
students receiving costly academic
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
support not just over but we're here to
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
talk today about vur so I'll tie the two
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
together this year New Hampshire's
 
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
voucher program has cost taxpayers $28
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
million nearly twice the Statewide
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
shortfall in the special education Aid
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
fund reaching higher New Hampshire as
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier has predicted
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
Universal eligibility in this Voucher
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
Program could cost New Hampshire
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers more than $100 million each
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
year this spending will not save
 
01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers any money as some proponents
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
including the person who submitted this
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
bill have suggested today we must assume
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
every single private or homeschooled
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
student in the state could or would
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
enroll in the voucher program these
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
students currently receive no State
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
funding and would be a new liability for
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers meanwhile many districts like
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
Dover are already not receiving all
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
necessary funds to adequately educate
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
their students including those with
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities these expenses sit squarely
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
in the Musto category indeed State and
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
feder federal laws require it I'm not
 
01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:00.039 align:start position:0%
here to invalidate anyone's personal
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
voucher story I'm simply here to remind
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
the committee that vouchers aren't a
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
must do they are a want to thank you
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very
 
01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.510 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very
much

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent luno thank you
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair thank you very much
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
um M deer for for joining us this
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon um you talked about um the the
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
questionable tax savings and I think tax
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
savings was was one of the things that
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
the that the sponsor of this bill was
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
really leaning on heavy but but out of
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
the um the in the um in the previous
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
year so the the the last year of the um
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
of the voucher program where we have
 
01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
full data from the from the Department
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
of Education that there were
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
5,321 students in the uh in the voucher
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
program but only um only around 200 of
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
them had actually exited from from their
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
um their public school to take a voucher
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
could you sort of contextualize that in
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
terms of what that means for tax savings
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
sure yeah in in the do Public School
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
System we haven't really seen all that
 
01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
much difference uh the majority of
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
people as you mentioned who are uh using
 
01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
the existing Voucher Program are coming
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
from either uh existing homeschool or
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
private school relationships I the
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
numbers that I have seen fluctuate a
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
little but generally it's around 85 or
 
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
90% that I've seen um are never were
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
using the resources available in the
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
public education system so I think it is
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
a misrepresentation to say um each
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
person who uses an expanded voucher uh
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
program would be saving this state 19 or
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
20 or whatever thousand dollar it was
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
because these students weren't using
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds to begin with by contrast
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
they would start using new taxpayer
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
funds and in a year where we have budget
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
shortfalls and concerns about how much
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
revenue we're raising and how much
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
revenue we've lost I think it is I I go
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
back to the phrase fiscally
 
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
irresponsible I think it is not money we
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
have to spend to create new spending for
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
students who weren't previously
 
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
receiving these funds thank you thank
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
question further questions we do have a
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
number of parents waiting to get out of
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you thank you for your
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
testimony um I believe you indicated
 
01:07:16.349 --> 01:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
that you're a parent of a student who
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
receives special education services sure
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
am and I'm thinking that as a school
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
board uh member you're aware that
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
children who receive an education
 
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
voucher um sign a waiver to not
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
participate in the federal requirements
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
for special education sure am could you
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
comment about that and about your
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
experiences as a parent of a specialed
 
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:39.799 align:start position:0%
student in public school and thank you
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question absolutely
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
boy two minutes goes quick I I had
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
originally had more in there about my
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
son my 14-year-old is a ninth grader
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
he's been receiving special education
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
services since he was seven so he is now
 
01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
7 years into the public education
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
program receiving special education
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
services because of lack of funding he
 
01:07:58.829 --> 01:07:58.839 align:start position:0%
didn't have a par educator for his
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
entire sixth and seventh grade year
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
those are hard years as a middle
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
schooler to not have the support that
 
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
you require and that the federal
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
government has mandated you deserve
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
through the individuals with
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
disabilities Education Act I think it's
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
essential for us to remember that
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
students who receive special education
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
services they are the only students in
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
the country who have a federally
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
protected right to a free and public
 
01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
education and as I mentioned this is why
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
I included the data I did as I mentioned
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
when you have schools like Dover who are
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that the amount of money
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's coming from the state is not
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
enough to provide those Services we have
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
that continued downshifting to local
 
01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it has negative effects on
 
01:08:40.269 --> 01:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
students like my son who didn't have the
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
ability to receive those services for
 
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
two years in a row it's getting better
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
now for him thankfully he's a freshman
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
now and he's really thriving at over
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
high school but it was really rough in
 
01:08:52.349 --> 01:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
those mid years and it would have been
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
rougher if his disabilities required him
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
to receive out of District placements
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
which as we know regularly cost six
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
figures a year thank you for the
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you uh I'd like
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
to call Gabriel Jetty and Then followed
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
sanago and did we have Brenda Quinn yeah
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
Brenda come on up and then uh Gabriel
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
Jetty then Wendy
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
Santiago thank you honorable repres
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
resentatives for hearing my thoughts um
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
I will say I've heard a lot about the
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
financial and I was actually going to to
 
01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
say some focus on the financial and that
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
there's uh Financial irresponsibility in
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
in um a program that is for the Merit of
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
children and I I'm a mental health
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
professional I've worked primarily with
 
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
children for 36 years and um care very
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
deeply about their well-being so I want
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
Choice I'm I'm a New Hampshire resident
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
from birth I like Choice um but I also
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
understand that the lack of
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
accountability um for any programming
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the public school district is
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
very dangerous um for the young people
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
that I see I also want to just speak to
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
a couple things that were were stated
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
one that choice is an important thing um
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
for young people I think public schools
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
are an important thing for young people
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the developmental
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
task of young people through grade
 
01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
school through high school um
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
generalization is incredibly important
 
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
and meaning that sitting next to
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
somebody with a different opinion a
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
different background different needs uh
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
is imperative to healthy development and
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
public schools offer that it is not for
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
everybody I understand but those who
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
fiscally can decide to be elsewhere can
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
do so this expansion speaks to making
 
01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
this available to people who could
 
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
already afford to make that choice and
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
the voucher as it stands now allows for
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
people who can't to to have their needs
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
met but I do think that I would much
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
rather see for the well-being of the
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
many kids that I've seen through my my
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
practice that the public schools get
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
more of the attention that they need and
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
that special education needs get better
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
addressed as they were back when I
 
01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
worked with the area agencies in my
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
first nine professional years um
 
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
integrating kids into schools we are not
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
adequately nor fairly funding those and
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
I understand there's a plan available to
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
do that um I would rather have our
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
energies put there than expanding a
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
voucher program that does not assure or
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
even um offer any kind of accountability
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
and does offer an increase in taxes that
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
are going to harm so many people who
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
want to stay in their homes and stay in
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
their towns and stay in their
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
communities that are largely built
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
around healthy Public School Systems
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%

testimony on this bill my name is
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
Gabriel Jetty and I am here today to ask
 
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
for your support of
 
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
hb15 um I am a born and raised New
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen I've been here my
 
01:12:23.229 --> 01:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
whole life um my husband and I have
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
three children two of them are with me
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
um and the ages are 6 4 and 1 this is
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
Henry and Gracie um and as a mother I
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
want to I want to and I try to give my
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
children the best opportunities for them
 
01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
and the ways that fit their individual
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
needs because of this we have enrolled
 
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
our children at St Francis School in
 
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
Lichfield we're we live in Manchester
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
but it's very close to us um we could
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
not be happier with the education that
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
they have received so far Henry right
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
here has gone from having problems with
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
letter recognition to reading and just a
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
few short months um they have natural
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
science classes in the woods they have a
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
little farm with sheep and chickens that
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
the children help out with um so it's
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
just a really holistic education and we
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
really really loved it um they also have
 
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
very small teacher to student ratios
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
which allows for more of that
 
01:13:14.669 --> 01:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
individualized learning which has very
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
um very much benefited Henry as
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
well um but we like many other families
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
sit just above the income limit to
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for the EFA benefit um now
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
because because of this we do pay out of
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
pocket for all of the children's
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
education expenses and we are able to
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
make it work but it's not easy it is
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
difficult every single month my husband
 
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
and I are budgeting to make sure like
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
where can we cut things because the
 
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
education is expensive um now again as a
 
01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
mother we want to give them the best
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities so we make those
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
sacrifices but uh expanding this bill it
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
would really help families like mine
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
with three and four plus children many
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
of them at St Francis as well who again
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
sit just above the income limit but
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
because they have larger families they
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot larger expenses to take care
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
of as well um so anyways I'm here again
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
to ask for you to support this bill um
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
because it's really helped the school
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
that our children go to has been
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful and beautiful and we would
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
just love to see that for every student
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%

EFA um and so I represent my family and
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about the story about
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
my son and how we came about
 
01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
EFA through um the
 
01:15:36.679 --> 01:15:39.110 align:start position:0%
EFA through um the
program

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.189 align:start position:0%
program
so

01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
my family should be began started
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
receiving the EFA approxim about five
 
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
years ago before this program my son had
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
been in a school where he had been
 
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
significantly bullied including being
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
taunted verbally
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
threatened um insulted and physically
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
harmed he would come home with ripped
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
pants and severely bodily injuries that
 
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
needed medical attention from both his
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
primary care office as well as
 
01:16:12.189 --> 01:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
Specialists such as
 
01:16:12.199 --> 01:16:14.030 align:start position:0%
Specialists such as
Orthopedics

01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately the schools turned
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
their Blind Eye to the
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
situation this is a public
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
school causing causing it to um continue
 
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
that my son my son's um accelerated
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
academics declined significantly and he
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
became afraid to attend school in turn I
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
needed I had to choose to homeschool him
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
for the rest of that year this incident
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
alarmed if my son had had this same
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
violent harassment and any other
 
01:16:59.470 --> 01:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
location other than a
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
school the individual's actions would
 
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
violate the New Hampshire harassment
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
laws outlined in RSA 4
 
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
6444 which supports to protect citizens
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
offenses now that we have the EFA my son
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
who sits next to me has been
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
flourishing um significant not only can
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
I yes not only in his education but in
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
his self-esteem and confidence he is 16
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
years old he is a full-time college
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
student he just inured his first job and
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
he's also a student pilot
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
so if it had not been for this program
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
my this would not have been available
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
for if you have more now Noah also
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
completed a card here so he's entitled
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
at 2 minutes as well okay uh so are you
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
on Noah's time right now
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
um he can
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
speak uh hello everyone I don't exactly
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
know what to say but
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
well I did have something planned I just
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
thought so this I don't um what speak
 
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
what you were talking I don't know
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
what okay um
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
so basically
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
um everybody has a right to have School
 
01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
rights my son is just a small is just
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
one person out of many we just heard
 
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
testimonies of children being sexually
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
assaulted sexually
 
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
harassed in the school
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
systems everybody has a right to be free
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
from those things but there are
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
but if all families just took their kids
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
out of school to homeschool them we
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have families
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
working so unfortunately it is necessary
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
to have a program like
 
01:18:59.629 --> 01:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
EFA to support the needs of these
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
children who seek alternative schooling
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
so they can avoid being abused at school
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
I my son would like to finish so I
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
remember that one of the main arguments
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
against this bill is that it provides
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
much funding to Christian and other
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
religious institutions and while the
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution does say that Congress and
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
well any laog making people can't
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
specifically support one religion the
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
EFA program doesn't specifically support
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
only Christians it's it can go to anyone
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
if a Jewish person wanted to go to a
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
Jewish school then they can go there
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
same with the Buddhist they any anyone
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
else and also with the public schools
 
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
another big point was that the private
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
schools don't perform as well as public
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
schools which to me that doesn't make
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
any sense because that my brief time in
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%

01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%

good um I'm Sarah Wen and I'm 10 years
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
old I used to go to public school but am
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
now going to private school when I was
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
in public school there were after school
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
activities but as I went further into my
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
education things were getting cut off
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
starting with these actor school
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
activities then the foreign languages
 
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.790 align:start position:0%
activities then the foreign languages
were

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
gone just before I got into Middle
 
01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
School the school didn't have the budget
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
to pay the teacher anymore we need
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
teachers to help with what we're
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
struggling with or to go beyond the
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum when we're ready there's only
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
one music teacher to teach grades K
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
eight the money that you would want to
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
send to families going to private school
 
01:21:31.629 --> 01:21:31.639 align:start position:0%
could be helping Public Schools ac
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
across the state um have opportunities
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
for students to learn what they love in
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
the towns they live in in conclusion
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
this money is better spent on public
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
schools to help students prepare for
 
01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%

01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
asking you to allow parents to make a
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
choice to send their kids to Quality
 
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
resourced public schools in the
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
communities that they live in as you
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
heard as my daughter has progressed
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
through schools um because of the
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
choices that this legislature and the
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
towns have made to reduce funding to the
 
01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.270 align:start position:0%
towns have made to reduce funding to the
public

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
schools these students have diminished
 
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities at every turn and over the
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
past couple of years I've engaged in a
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
significant amount of Schoolboard
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
advocacy to bring these opportunities
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
back but there just isn't any local
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
money to bring them back with and so in
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
the end we made a very difficult choice
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
to send our child to private school last
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
year um both of our children and it was
 
01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:47.719 align:start position:0%
hard it was very hard we had to make
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
Cuts we are not going to remodel the
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
basement that we had planned to do we
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
are not um we are not have the savings
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to have we don't can I
 
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
talked take take another minute okay
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you we um my personal sting is
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
that I don't have my ski passes anymore
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
but in the end last year um we went to
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
the annual meeting and at the annual
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
meeting the fight was not about what
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
programs we could bring back to the
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
school it was whether or not we could
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
fix the leaking moldy windows in the
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
building these are the choices that the
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
schools have to make and so I'm asking
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
you today to make a choice I'm asking
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
you to fund public schools and make sure
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
that students have quality schools in
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
their local communities so we don't have
 
01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
to drive 35 minutes out of our way to
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
access a quality public a quality school
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
um or I'm asking you to make a choice to
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
spend public money to make sure that
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
people like me who choose private
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
education can afford ski passes in
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
addition to that private education I
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
think the choice here is clear on where
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
your public money is best spent thank
 
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much are there any
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee Sarah did
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
you type all that up yourself on that
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
report I did um but then my mom did help
 
01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
me a little bit with the editing but it
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
was mostly me very good job
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
congratulations to both of you thank you
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:39.470 align:start position:0%
uh Ronnie Grover and Donna chick is
following

01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
Ronnie hello I am Ronnie's mom my name
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
is Amanda Quint qu i n
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
c um this is Ronnie he is 11 years old
 
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
and he has been participating in EFA for
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
about two years Ronnie was in public
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
school for seven years we live in
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
Kingston um he started when he was three
 
01:25:04.159 --> 01:25:04.910 align:start position:0%
Kingston um he started when he was three
in

01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
preschool he got diagnosed with high
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
functioning autism and sensory
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
processing now throughout school he
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
always had a difficult
 
01:25:22.109 --> 01:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
time with the surrounding the the noise
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
the lights um so even though he was
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
having a tough time I still pushed him
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
to go um fast forward a couple years he
 
01:25:39.109 --> 01:25:39.119 align:start position:0%
was being bullied at school um kids were
 
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
not being nice to him in the school
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
district would not do what he needed to
 
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
make him feel comfortable and safe at
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
school which to me does not is not right
 
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's not right every child should feel
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
feel safe at public school and if they
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
don't they definitely should be able to
 
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
receive EFA funds now the EFA funds are
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
less than
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
$5,000 for a school year that is not
 
01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere near what a private school
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
costs so if I was right now we are
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
homeschooling so we don't have any extra
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
money for any anything out of the
 
01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
ordinary we barely can get food on the
 
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
table but that money from EFA helps him
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable learning and feeling
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
safe at the same time all children
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
should be able to feel safe while they
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
get an
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
education may I speak real
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
quick um just a second I I want to make
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
sure that people are speaking do have
 
01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
pink cards yes go ahead
 
01:26:55.159 --> 01:26:56.430 align:start position:0%
pink cards yes go ahead
okay

01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
um EFA has helped me through a lot um if
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
it wasn't for it I would not have all
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
the supplies that I have to do and get a
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%

01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you my name is
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
Haley Cajun I'm 13 years old I live in
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
oopy I'd like to start off with I have
 
01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
been in and out of the foster care
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
system a few times involving two
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
different states
 
01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
because of that not only were my
 
01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
academics low but my G my grades kept
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
dropping in my prior educational
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
settings I started to project an image
 
01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
of myself that really wasn't me I was
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
frustrated and I felt lost with my life
 
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
my family and I decided that home school
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
was best for me with the help of EFA we
 
01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
have been able to hire a tutor my grades
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
are not perfect but they're all in their
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
way and I now able to take lessons for
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
dance which has helped me get out more
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
and build my self-esteem EFA has given
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
me an environment to learn and to be
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
successful in my education but I do fear
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
that if we no longer qualify for EFA
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
funding my family would not be able to
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
offer the education that fits me best my
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
parents have worked hard to straighten
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
their life out for the best it would
 
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
hurt me and them to see a piece of that
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
hard work dug out and thrown away please
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee EFA will be available
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.109 align:start position:0%

half oh that must be her time 20 months
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
ago at the age of eight and a half my
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
grandson could not identify numbers 1 to
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
10 he didn't know his alphabet nor could
 
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
he write his name due to his parents'
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
drug use he had only sporadically
 
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
attended Public School upon taking
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
guardianship our immediate task was to
 
01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
educate him we've utilized tutors and
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
one-on-one homeschool instruction he's
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
here today so we can put a face on
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom the thought that a
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
financial cap could deny this child all
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
the advantages he needs to catch up and
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
succeed in his education should hit
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
Accord with each and every one of you
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of me some of my
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
grandkids were in and out of foster care
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
the end story is a happy one as that my
 
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
daughter and her husband were reunited
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
with their children 3 years ago but
 
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
along with the educa but along with the
 
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
emotional toll these children paid their
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
education also suffered public school
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
isn't working for them private school
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
isn't working for them their parents
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
recently brought them home to learn in
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
the security of their home where the
 
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
closeness of family creates a safe
 
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%

01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
minute look at these children and let
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
them be the face of educational Freedom
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
this program should be open to all
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
children so that they all have the same
 
01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:39.800 align:start position:0%

Xander um I attended on public school
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
for my kids um each of them have special
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
needs and so when I was told by
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
worldclass experts I'm talking doctors
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
from Boston and even doctors Boston had
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
blown in and I saw Specialists when they
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
said your kids need this and this will
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
be uh needed for school I thought it
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
would be really easy um I also have a
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
niece that I helped raise and four times
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
I have been sat across from public
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
school Educators and been told that they
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
do not want to follow the educational
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
and even the physical safety plans for
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
my children so my intention was always
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
to public school but it did not work for
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
us um we have found the solution in
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
going private we have uh PT OT uh we
 
01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
have neurology from Boston and many
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
others the EPA allows us to make a
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
positive Choice uh for my niece this a
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
private school for my eldest she's in a
 
01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
private learning program um for my
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
middle and homeschool is homeschooling
 
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
and for my youngest when he ages into
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
the program in the fall um it's going to
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
be working with um private OT and PT
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
Specialists to help him work on the
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
skills he needs to catch up with his
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
peers and just to let you guys know I've
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
heard that the money is not tracked
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
actually every last every last penny
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
spent by parents or schools on the EPA
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
program is on the children's scholarship
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
phone website um
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
and income levels shouldn't be a factor
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
the parents who have millions are not
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to bother with the paperwork
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
necessary because there is a lot of
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork for parents um and those who
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
are on the edge who need this money will
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
be able to access it they should not
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
have to decide between a um working two
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
jobs to make sure their kids get what
 
01:34:17.229 --> 01:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
they need and having the money for to
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
send their kids where they believe that
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
their kids do best um please give all
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%

01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:28.520 align:start position:0%

01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
the help they
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%

one coming down the hallway look at he

split yeah he is very capable and he's
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
very capable it's mostly due to the fact
 
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
that we are able to access um private PT
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
the school actually um said that their
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
primary goal was to get him walking
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that Boston children
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
said his primary goal is mobility um so
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's been a long fight with a lot of
 
01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%

my testimony in 2021 we moved to pelum
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and enrolled our kids in
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
the school system in 2023 the elementary
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
school failed Us by lacking quality
 
01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
education inadequate disciplinary Pro
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
policies and pushing disagreeable social
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
agendas the following year we embarked
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
on a personalized attentive and
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
homebased education program for our
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
children and all three have surpassed
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
metrics from their public school
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
education according to town reports
 
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment in the pelum school district
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
has an average has had an average 3%
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
decline over the past 5 Years From 2019
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
to 2023 yet is an average 65% of total
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
taxes according to the New Hampshire
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I achieved data
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the same period students had an
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
average English language arts Ela and
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
math proficiency rate of 51% and 41%
 
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
respectively their proficiency numbers
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
fail to meet the state targets each year
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
suffice to say we have no intention to
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
reenroll our children into the public
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
school system unless those shortcomings
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
are remedied to a satisfactory level
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
these unfortunate circumstances leave
 
01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:13.159 align:start position:0%
parents to choose between a poor public
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
school education or taking on the
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
financial burden just to give their kids
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
at least a decent private
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
education at the end of the day it is
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
always in the best interest of our
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
children to choose the method of
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
Education that best prepares them for
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
life with the values of our family so my
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
statement to those who oppose this bill
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
is this as a family on the mass border

other children in our community are
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
being denied resources because of your
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
perception of what success should look
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
like an EFA would help lessen the burden
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
of providing a better education for our
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
children by opening access to additional
 
01:37:55.589 --> 01:37:55.599 align:start position:0%

headline schools in this state and
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about having to face
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
disagreeable social agendas
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh was there any way for you to hold it
 
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
to address this with them oneon-one and
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
and just have a conversation with them
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
explaining to them what the nature of
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
that was and why it was so disagreeable
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
or did they just shut you
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
off well there's there wasn't really any
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
one specific instance it was a a
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
culmination of social agendas that don't
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
don't fit with our family values did
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
they have these in writing excuse me
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%

01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry if there's a form for me
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%

01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
public school system I'm happy to do it
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
um but just an atmosphere of social
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
agenda being pushed in the school system
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
um made us choose to homeschool our
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%

cards um I want to get the real you're
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%

01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%

01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%

card sure it's Jessica Mig pardon me Mig
M

01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
M
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
L and I am here in support of the bill
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
and um I am not a recipient of the EFA
 
01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
because I I lie my husband and I lie
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
just above that um income um bracket
 
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
where we would be able to apply for it
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
and as a result we um we've had to make
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
great sacrifices uh the only reason why
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
we're here today is because my children
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
had dentist appointments trying to put
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
them back into school at noon time is a
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
nightmare so we are able to to be here
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
um and I I wanted to speak today to say
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
that uh the if even if we could get a
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
little bit of support uh financially to
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
send our kids to a school that supports
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh what our family values are uh it
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
would change our um it would change the
 
01:40:54.990 --> 01:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
mindset for my husband and I we live
 
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
just above that line and my husband
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
works in sales one more dip of the
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
economy um and it wouldn't just be our
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
kids education it would be a whole lot
 
01:41:06.669 --> 01:41:06.679 align:start position:0%
more we Pro we live in Dober New
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um rent in do New Hampshire um
 
01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um rent in do New Hampshire um
runs

01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
runs
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
about let's just say I barely can afford
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
my rent I'll leave it at that and uh
 
01:41:18.189 --> 01:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
should something happened and we
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do that not only
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
would we um potentially lose our kids
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
education in the school and there uh he
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
go he's four she's uh Isabelle is five
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
we would not only lose their school but
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
we'd probably have to leave the town and
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
go to a different school and this also
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
presents an issue for us where our kids
 
01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
are established um and so just having
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
the freedom of education for our kids is
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
is everything um I understand that
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
public schools need funding too but when
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
it comes to uh my kids and our our
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
community around us uh having um an
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
education that not only backs up what we
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
what our family believes but also like
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
the values of the kids that um our kids
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
are in school with and spending a lot of
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
time with that's it thank you very much
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.629 --> 01:42:09.639 align:start position:0%

okay hello my name is Alysa s Molina I'm
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
here today to ask you to support house
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
built age 115 I'm a senior in high
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
school who has been receiving the
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
education Freedom funds for over four
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
years now I grew up being homeschooled
 
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
by my single mom until I was of high
 
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
school age I wanted to seek out new
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
better opportunities and try new things
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
for the last 3 years I have been
 
01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
attending a private school that has
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
afforded me much growth
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities and a brighter future I
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
would be in a very different situation
 
01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
right now without the EFA just this
 
01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
recent year I can tell you a very dear
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
and close friend of mine was being
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
bullied at her school it was drastically
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
hurting her and her life she needed a
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
change a new school she couldn't go on
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
in this same environment she's now at an
 
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
amazing school but that wouldn't have
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
been possible without the FAA I ask you
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
to please take a moment to think about
 
01:43:30.189 --> 01:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
someone you know someone you love who
 
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
has been bullied stuck in a toxic
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
environment or maybe they would be stuck
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
at a level unable to reach their full
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
potential when they could be exceling in
 
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
things they're naturally gifted in
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps like mathematics or history or
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
maybe they would be even worse
 
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing the oposite academically
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
challenged struggling to keep up with
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
everyone else their confidence and
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
selfworth being torn down leaving them
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
questioning wondering why can't I be
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
like everyone else when they would be
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
excelling if they could receive the help
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
they needed think of these kids please
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
who are at a disposition in their life
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is entirely out of their control
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't get to choose their family's
 
01:44:13.589 --> 01:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
incomes where they were born or how
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
others would treat them sadly there are
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
hundreds of kids like this in New
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who face these realities daily
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
the fa has started this positive change
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
for these kids like me to have better
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
growth opportunities and achievement to
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
attain a better life they deserve I
 
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
would know as I'm one of them by passing
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
this bill you would be making the EFA
 
01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
more accessible to all regardless of
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
their income giving these kids and their
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
families a chance to attain a life they
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
deserve wouldn't you want that if it
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
were your child so I implore you to
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
please be part of these change to give
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
these kids opportunities which in turn
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%

01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much our
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman long long time no
 
01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
see haven't seen you in a while good to
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
be here my name is Mark Malone I
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
represent the town of eping Rockingham
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
District 5 and I'm here I'm not here
 
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
against uh educational Freedom acts uh
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
accounts what I am here as a c capacity
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
is also as the vice chair of the eping
 
01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:53.719 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
and as it right now my opposition to
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is based on the fact
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
that family who wants to send their
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
child to Philips exer Academy which has
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
a tuition of
 
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
$52,599 plus $900 for supplies can get
 
01:46:13.709 --> 01:46:13.719 align:start position:0%
an education Freedom
 
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
account right is that
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
correct There's No
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
Limit now I don't know how many people
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
will actually do this but to think think
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
about the numbers of families out there
 
01:46:27.629 --> 01:46:27.639 align:start position:0%
who can send their child it's a day this
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
is for the day student by the way so
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
somebody living in New Hampshire could
 
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
likely apply for that as a member of the
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
budget Committee in eping I find that
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
outrageous that the taxpayers of eping
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
and I walked around last fall
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
campaigning to mobile homes Shacks where
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
people were struggling to pay their
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
property tax that we're going to spend
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to fund someone
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
to go to Philips xer Academy with the
 
01:46:57.149 --> 01:46:57.159 align:start position:0%
tuition is
 
01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
$53,000 now somebody wrote that local
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
districts spend I think like drunken
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
Sailors I think I've read that
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
someplace what is it if we open the
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
accounts to anyone regardless of
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
income how much money are we going to be
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
spending here how much are the taxpayers
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
of eping going to be spending to
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
subsidize people now the folks who are
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
here who are struggling I see the need
 
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
for the EFA accounts I see that but we
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
have a cap and it's means tested you
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
want to take away means testing you are
 
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
want to take away means testing you are
taking

01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
away the the ability of weing taxpayers
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
to fund adequately public education for
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
the children who don't take
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
efas so again think about that that you
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
are just opening it's a Pandora's Box
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
that you are opening with no limits
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%

uh testifying here this afternoon and
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
also for your service on the eping um
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
budget committee so um there's been a
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
lot of um recent news I think related to
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
um some information released by the
 
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education New Hampshire
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in the last
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
several days with respect to the amount
 
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
of of state do that support public
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
school districts but uh but one of the
 
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
things they haven't released uh publicly
 
01:48:32.109 --> 01:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
is the fact that across all the
 
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
245 uh districts um in the state that
 
01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh T municipalities in the
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
state that um that only a hundred of
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
them received more State Grant and 145
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
of them their state Grant went down in
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
many cases very significantly um as a
 
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
member of the budget committee uh you're
 
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
probably aware then next year that
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
eeping state Grant is scheduled to go
 
01:48:57.159 --> 01:48:58.390 align:start position:0%
eeping state Grant is scheduled to go
down

01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:49:01.390 --> 01:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
right right what does that mean for
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
eping well somebody's got to pay for the
 
01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
schools so either so either um we're
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to raise taxes and that was I mean
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
we are very aware and eing about the tax
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
rate and about the implication of
 
01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
votings and we had our public hearings
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
both on the town and the school budgets
 
01:49:19.229 --> 01:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
last night
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
and you know it's not pretty looking at
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
that we we have pushed back on school
 
01:49:27.149 --> 01:49:27.159 align:start position:0%
and town uh spending but at the same
 
01:49:28.589 --> 01:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
time we're looking at to try to keep
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
teachers contract for example is coming
 
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
out it's going to be $400,000 warrant
 
01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:35.189 align:start position:0%
out it's going to be $400,000 warrant
article

01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
$400,000 that money is going to increase
 
01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
the tax rate so I am just wondering if
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to pass that and
 
01:49:45.149 --> 01:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass it then we saw what
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
happened the last time eping didn't pass
 
01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
the teachers contract the district lost
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
a number of really good teachers this is
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
what happen when we don't adequately
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
fund our public educations
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
which educate the vast majority of
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
students in this state got to keep that
 
01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.350 align:start position:0%
students in this state got to keep that
in

01:50:04.350 --> 01:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
mind so we want to spend taxpayer
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
dollars so some child can go to Philips
 
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
Seer Academy with a subsidy now it
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay the whole
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
tuition but there's no reason why those
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
that family couldn't apply for it and no
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
reason why they won't get it
 
01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
you have no controls on this Bill thank
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%

01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I'd like to call Jen
 
01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:41.800 align:start position:0%

01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
is Jennifer black I live in Windham I'm
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of HB 115 around the
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
time my son was born 22 years ago I
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
spoke to a neighbor who was a long time
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
public school teacher in one of the
 
01:51:03.679 --> 01:51:04.589 align:start position:0%
public school teacher in one of the
local

01:51:04.589 --> 01:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
schools she lamented the behavior of
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
students and how hard it was to teach
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
she described the CL classroom as
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
chaotic as teachers were not allowed to
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
discipline students concerned about my
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
children's future education I dealt
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
further I asked her if she was able to
 
01:51:20.109 --> 01:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
call their parents when they misbehaved
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
she says teachers do not want to deal
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
with parents at all because they don't
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
believe their child is ever at fault I
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
asked what about parents who want to
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
hold their children accountable and what
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure their child is
 
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
behaving she said we don't want to deal
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
with parents at all we just direct
 
01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
parents to the principal my husband and
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
I as as parents of six children did not
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
want our kids teachers to think of us as
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
the enemy we feel it is our
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to see to it that our
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
children are raised and properly
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
educated in order to be independent
 
01:51:50.910 --> 01:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
God-fearing responsible contributing
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
members of society after discussion with

and I decided that I would give up my
 
01:52:02.910 --> 01:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
well-paying job so I could stay home and
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
raise and educate our
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
children I homeschooled for several

years but when my kids started becoming
 
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
interested in sports and other
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%

private options they were few and far
 
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
between with six children we found a

small Christian School and after talking
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
to parents and teachers we grateful to
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
hear that parents and teachers were
 
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
collaborators not enemies in the
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
education process that children are not
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
permitted to disrupt classes and that
 
01:52:32.350 --> 01:52:32.360 align:start position:0%
students are well educated in math

best interest for their children and for
 
01:52:40.069 --> 01:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
society in general that their children
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
be educated outside the chaos of the
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
local public school have to make many
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
sacrifices to afford the both the taxes
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
that they pay for the public schools
 
01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:50.679 align:start position:0%
their children do not attend and the
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
tuition for the school that they have
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
decided is best for their children
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
although we have never purchased a new
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
car never gone on extravagant vacations
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
never taken our kids on an airplane our
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
children have benefited greatly from our
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
choice to avoid public school and we do
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
not regret our decision one bit
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are many other
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
parents who' like to be able to make
 
01:53:11.229 --> 01:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
this decision but can't afford to make
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
the necessary
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
sacrifices I uh I would like to submit

so I'm Gian jel at resident of Madbury I
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
have two children in public schools and
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
I'm a school board member on the oyer
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
river Cooperative School District sa5 I
 
01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:33.639 align:start position:0%
am here representing the school board of
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
w r people move to our district because
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
of the public school system we oppose
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
hb15 I've heard many people today speak
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
to educational attainment and access and
 
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
the lack thereof the best most fiscal
 
01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
responsible most Equitable way to ensure
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
that all students in New Hampshire
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
access and achieve the best education
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
possible is to fully fund public
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
education vouchers efas do not ensure
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
Equity because even with Aid many if not
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
most families cannot afford the cost of
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
private or parial education this bill
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
does not affect that fact because it
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
expands access to the higher income as
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to lower income folks this is
 
01:55:10.109 --> 01:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
quite evident by who is already
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
receiving the vouchers which is
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 75% of families who have
 
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
never attended Public School vouchers
 
01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
are not fiscally responsible and this
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
expansion would make it even more so
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
their expansion negatively affects the
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
School District budget and therefore
 
01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
services and program the schools are
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
legally mandated to provide in order to
 
01:55:28.350 --> 01:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
maintain and Achieve high standards the
 
01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
funding shortfall must be addressed
 
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
which typically translates to
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
unsustainable increases in property
 
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
taxes and unfortunately cuts to services
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
this negative fiscal impact is
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
particularly relevant in light of
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
projected budget shortfalls but also due
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
to the current Court declared inadequate
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
funding for public education overall and
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
those court cases are still still
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
standing and the massive Gap in
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for special education
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
which is particularly affecting our
 
01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:53.470 align:start position:0%
which is particularly affecting our
district

01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
public education covers and accepts all
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
students private and parial students
 
01:55:59.069 --> 01:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
schools do not Public Schools must
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
accept special education students and
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
are proud to do so but private schools
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
do not and therefore do not show the
 
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
cost the vast majority of students in
 
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attend public schools the
 
01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%
voucher program is also deeply
 
01:56:10.750 --> 01:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
problematic due to its lack of
 
01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
accountability oversight and standards
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
the out ofst State organization running
 
01:56:15.149 --> 01:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
it has done such a poor oversight that
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
an audit of a small sub sample show that
 
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
25% of the families enrolled should not
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
have been public education however is
 
01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
very transparent accountable and has
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
many legally mandated constraints and
 
01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in light of all these
 
01:56:30.069 --> 01:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
things I I ask you to oppose
 
01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
hb15 thank you very much questions from
 
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative
 
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
your work on behalf of public schools
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
could you speak about your District's um
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:53.800 align:start position:0%
parents we have a pretty good access to
 
01:56:55.870 --> 01:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
that we have rules where um if a teacher
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
if a if a parent actually emails a
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
student they have to respond uh if a
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
parent emails a teacher they have to
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
respond within 48 Hours um so
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
immediately they have to have that if
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen then it immediately
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
goes to the principal and the people
 
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
have access to that um communication our
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
school district is actually very good
 
01:57:14.109 --> 01:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
people can email they can call they can
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
they can visit and um there's typically
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
not a problem with that it's very open
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
access people attend the school board
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
meetings one of the things I think is
 
01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
actually a strength with oyer river is
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that the community is actually
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
very active and if they have a problem
 
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
they N US snow immediately so I actually
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
say the communication is quite excellent
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
01:57:36.790 --> 01:57:36.800 align:start position:0%

District 13 the great town of Hudson
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire is facing the
 
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
challenge of economic efficiency an
 
01:58:07.069 --> 01:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
increasing amount of money is being
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
requested and spent while enrollment is
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
sharply declining and yet educational
 
01:58:13.709 --> 01:58:13.719 align:start position:0%
proficiency is also declining from a
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
business perspective one might say we
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
are simply not achieving the desired
 
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
return on investment what are we to do
 
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
it is time for New Hampshire to have
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
Universal educational Freedom accounts
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
in support of universal efas I would
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
like to first talk about making quality
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
education options more attainable though
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
many communities offer an adequate
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
education not all communities offer the
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
quality education desired by the parents
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
and custodians that meet the unique
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
needs of their child or children as
 
01:58:45.069 --> 01:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
we've heard from several testimonies
 
01:58:46.990 --> 01:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
already suppose you have a student
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
facing challenges not being met by a
 
01:58:50.669 --> 01:58:50.679 align:start position:0%
local school or you have a gifted
 
01:58:50.679 --> 01:58:52.189 align:start position:0%
local school or you have a gifted
student

01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
what are the options if a local school
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
is not providing education at this
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
quality level desired by the parent or
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
Guardian there are limited options
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
available and these educational
 
01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities would be made more
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
feasible and more attainable with
 
01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:07.109 align:start position:0%
feasible and more attainable with
universal

01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
universal
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
efas next I would like to talk about
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
accountability and local control for the
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
money being spent on students education
 
01:59:16.990 --> 01:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
currently parents and custodians using
 
01:59:19.229 --> 01:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
the efas have greater accountability
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
than any school administrative unit has
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
first each EFA applicant has their
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
financial status verified and grants are
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
then prated accordingly then every item
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
requested for reimbursement is reviewed
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
by the EFA special program before the
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
EFA funds are dispersed for
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement each request is reviewed
 
01:59:41.629 --> 01:59:41.639 align:start position:0%
and substantiated I support Universal
 
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
efas because efas inherently provide
 
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
more direct accountability for the money
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
that is being spent through Universal
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
efas we can give households greater
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
control of a relatively small part of
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
the total money being spent on their
 
01:59:57.709 --> 01:59:57.719 align:start position:0%
students education it is the ultimate in
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
local control lastly I would like to
 
02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
emphasize something mentioned earlier
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
return on investment Universal efas
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
allow for parents and Guardians to make
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
that direct investment into their
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
student whether it is tuition tutoring
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
online learning school supplies or other
 
02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
Scholastic expenses Universal efas will
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
give more options and provide for
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
enhanced accountability for investing in
 
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
their students the students in New
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be found very capable of
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
given the right resources and additional
 
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities Universal efas are a good
 
02:00:29.790 --> 02:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
investment in the students of New
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the interest of time in
 
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
picking up my own child from school I
 
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
will not be taking any questions oh
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you have a you know
 
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
written comment why don't you submit
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
that to us too or from the portal or
 
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
wherever I I I will thank you very much
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative Joe Alexander then
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad and members of
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
House Education funding for the record
 
02:00:59.550 --> 02:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
my name is Joe Alexander I represent the
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
town of gown um I'm here today as a
 
02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
proud product of New Hampshire schools
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
but my story today is not about
 
02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
education I received it's about the
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
importance of giving every child the
 
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find a school that fits
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
their educational individual needs
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
whether academic social or emotional as
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
a young man I struggled with my identity
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
I spent years coming to terms with being
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
gay but my experience in school wasn't
 
02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
always easy I wasn't always comfortable
 
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
with my
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
surroundings or the people I interacted
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
with which made it harder for me to D
 
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
Thrive I'm proud of how far our
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
community has come since then how much
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
more accepting and supportive it has
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
become for individuals like myself but
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
not every child today feels the same
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
comfort and security for some students
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
finding a school environment that
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
Embraces them is not just important it's
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
critical I fundamentally believe that we
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
need to invest in families if the school
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
is not providing a good product for a
 
02:01:56.430 --> 02:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
family the state should invest those
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
funds out elsewhere I do not want any
 
02:02:01.390 --> 02:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
student to feel like the bullied gay
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
child trapped in a school with no way
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
out this bill is about educational
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
Freedom it's about ensuring that every
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
child no matter their situation has a
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
chance to find the school that's the
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
best fit for them that's why I'm proud
 
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
to co-sponsor
 
02:02:17.069 --> 02:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
hb15 and I hope all of you will join me
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
in voting for it thank you thank you

02:02:50.589 --> 02:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
name is Mary wilky I'm a retired public
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
school teacher from conquer and I oppose
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
this bill uh first of all any expansion
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
of this program whether to Universal
 
02:03:00.669 --> 02:03:00.679 align:start position:0%
eligibility or to 500% of federal
 
02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
federal poverty guidelines which would
 
02:03:04.109 --> 02:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
be about
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
$161,000 uh for a family of four would
 
02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
mean more public money taken away from
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
our community Public Schools where
 
02:03:13.950 --> 02:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
nearly 90% of our children in New
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attend um we have parents in
 
02:03:19.149 --> 02:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
communities throughout this state who
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
love their Public Schools but they're
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
upset about how teacher turnover or lack
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
of foreign languages or art uh classes
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
or the state of disrepair of their
 
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
buildings um in other words reduced
 
02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities that their children face
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
because they happen to live in the wrong
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
ZIP code all too often we hear of
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
elderly people being forced out of their
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
homes because they can't pay their
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
property taxes and that's because uh
 
02:03:45.549 --> 02:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
monies that the state is supposed to be
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
providing or being downshifted onto the
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers we also have a
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
serious Revenue uh deficit looming ahead
 
02:03:56.589 --> 02:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
and the prospect of big budget cuts so
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem to be the right time
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
to expand this program by giving money
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
to even more parents who are probably
 
02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
already affording private schools on
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
their own as have 80% of the people who
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
are currently receiving
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
vouchers um I'm also concerned about
 
02:04:17.069 --> 02:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
good stewardship requires uh getting
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
good answers to questions before
 
02:04:21.549 --> 02:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
expanding a program we don't even know
 
02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
if the $73 million that's been spent on
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
this program has had a positive or
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
negative impact on student outcomes we
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't have any data here to tell us but
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
in uh reports from other states show
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
that voucher programs are leading to
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
lower academic achievement in part
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
because many of the providers that
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
spring up in response to voucher
 
02:04:43.870 --> 02:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
programs are of poor quality uh to what
 
02:04:46.030 --> 02:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
extent our vouchers simply replacing
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
scholarships that the schools were
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
providing before which would mean we're
 
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
enriching the schools not the and the
 
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
families come out with no net benefit
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
financially um I have a number of other
 
02:04:59.709 --> 02:04:59.719 align:start position:0%
concerns which I feel ought to be
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
addressed before you expand the program
 
02:05:03.069 --> 02:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
and I feel you ought to know we all
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
ought to know and they're on my written
 
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
testimony which I will hand in and thank
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%

back I think she was putting money in a
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
meter and
 
02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:23.870 align:start position:0%
meter and
Amy

02:05:23.870 --> 02:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
Amy
 
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and then we'll and then we'll
 
02:05:37.239 --> 02:05:38.270 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and then we'll and then we'll
have

02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
uh uh Megan if she's back yet from the
 
02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
okay hello Amy Hansen I live in Amhurst
 
02:05:52.830 --> 02:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
I I'm here to express my strong
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
opposition to the proposal for Universal
 
02:05:58.109 --> 02:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the EFA program in New
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire while I understand the desire
 
02:06:02.109 --> 02:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
to provide more educational options for
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
families there are serious concerns
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
about extending the program to All
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
Families regardless of income level or
 
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
specific need one little sentence being
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
omitted from the original Law is a huge
 
02:06:19.390 --> 02:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
impact one undermining public education
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
Public Schools serve as a foundation for
 
02:06:23.069 --> 02:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
education for the majority of our
 
02:06:24.750 --> 02:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire and would harm
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
lowincome and vulnerable students who
 
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
rely on public education for quality and
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
Equitable learning
 
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
experience Equity issues lower-income
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
families may still face challenges
 
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
accessing private educational options
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
even with EFA expansion The Divide this
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
divides rather than helps level the
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
playing field by discounting families
 
02:06:47.229 --> 02:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
who can pay the tuition regardless of
 
02:06:47.239 --> 02:06:47.910 align:start position:0%
who can pay the tuition regardless of
the

02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
vouchers selective enrollment private
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
religious schools can also pick who they
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
choose to come to their schools and that
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
changes the playing field as well as
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
some of the people who would benefit
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
from it might not even have the option
 
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
to go to those places accountability and
 
02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
oversight public schools are held to
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
rigorous standards assessments
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum regulations and also hiring
 
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
requirements based on certifications but
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
private schools are not always subject
 
02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
to the same scrutiny leaving students
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
without the protections and supports
 
02:07:22.350 --> 02:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
they need to Su succeed like I APS and
 
02:07:25.149 --> 02:07:25.159 align:start position:0%
504s increased financial burden the cost
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
of funding such program for every
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
student could lead to higher taxes or
 
02:07:31.549 --> 02:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
Cuts other essential services such as
 
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
education for all separation of church
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
and state tax dollars should not be used
 
02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
for any religious entity expanding EFA
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
to all students without addressing these
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
broader concerns could have unintended
 
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
negative consequences for both public
 
02:07:46.990 --> 02:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
education and students it serves there
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
is currently systems in place for our
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
students who require out of District
 
02:07:51.199 --> 02:07:52.149 align:start position:0%
students who require out of District
place

02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
we should use those thank you for your
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
you uh next person up would be is she
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
back yet from the
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
Joseph uh yes I restate my name Joe coll
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm from Portsmouth um and thanks for
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
having the open hearing um you know
 
02:08:31.390 --> 02:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of feeling about how
 
02:08:34.109 --> 02:08:34.119 align:start position:0%
Choice has been so helpful to people but
 
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
the bill isn't about choice for what
 
02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
kind of education to get the bill is
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
about whether the public should pay for
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
that this the bill is is proposes that
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
the public the taxpayers in New
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pays for that choice and
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
there's been a that this whole thing
 
02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
about vouer programs in the last couple
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
decades has been an aema to everything
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
that came prior to that before
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
everything that came prior to that the
 
02:09:01.069 --> 02:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
public paid for public
 
02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
education and what's been going on the
 
02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
last couple of decades is Public Funding
 
02:09:08.229 --> 02:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
has been cut and cut again and then
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's you know people need help with
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
vouchers so it it's it's not it's it's
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
radical and it's not
 
02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:19.189 align:start position:0%
radical and it's not
traditional

02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
02:09:22.589 --> 02:09:22.599 align:start position:0%
um the um there's a lot of things that
 
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
are not conservative about this this
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a program one of the things is
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
it undercuts local autonomy you know you
 
02:09:29.069 --> 02:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people in New Hampshire I
 
02:09:30.109 --> 02:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
don't know how many hundreds of people
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire give so much of their
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
time to Schoolboard service and all that
 
02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and basically what it's
 
02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
telling them is look you know we're
 
02:09:40.350 --> 02:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
going to take money from the public
 
02:09:44.189 --> 02:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
system and fund private system so it's
 
02:09:45.709 --> 02:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
undercutting all the efforts that
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
individual people are putting into the
 
02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:48.430 align:start position:0%
individual people are putting into the
school

02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.310 align:start position:0%
school
systems

02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
so the other big thing about I I got to
 
02:09:54.549 --> 02:09:54.559 align:start position:0%
speak what's good about Public School
 
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
Systems I'm I'm I'm I'm a child of
 
02:09:59.229 --> 02:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
immigrants and I went to a public school
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
where I was extreme low minority um one
 
02:10:08.430 --> 02:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
of the things it does is it is it um
 
02:10:13.069 --> 02:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
okay it's uh it works against The Silo
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
the problem you know we all live in
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
silos now it's it's a horrible problem
 
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
you know people don't talk to each other
 
02:10:19.870 --> 02:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
they don't relate to anybody that thinks
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
differently than them opposite to come
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
different different cultural backgrounds
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
and everybody everybody every kid in
 
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
school has to go to school together and
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
having that experience I think made a
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
huge difference in my life because I got
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
expand expanded to a lot of white white
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
people and it made it I think it makes a
 
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
lot a big difference to a lot of kids so
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak for the for public
 
02:10:43.709 --> 02:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
schools and against the Bill thank you

That hi uh my name is Megan Davis I am a
 
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
recipient of the EFA my daughter gets it
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
um she's been at a wonderful School a
 
02:11:18.990 --> 02:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
Dublin Christian and I have no money to
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
send her there so without the EFA she
 
02:11:25.229 --> 02:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
would not be there and they have very
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
high standards at Dublin uh her she was
 
02:11:33.069 --> 02:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
reading in kindergarten and now she's
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
reading uh chapter books in second grade
 
02:11:38.549 --> 02:11:38.559 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I'm really grateful for
 
02:11:41.790 --> 02:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
the EFA because she not only can go to
 
02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:43.270 align:start position:0%
the EFA because she not only can go to
Dublin

02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
Dublin
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
Christian but I can also sent her to
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
gymnastics too so the $5,000 covers
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh even more than gymnastics and Dublin
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
Christian so I mean it's a great thing
 
02:12:01.629 --> 02:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
for people in New Hampshire and you know
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
um my uh I come from a middle inome
 
02:12:09.149 --> 02:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
middle inome family upper middle income
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh so like $200,000 my dad makes and we
 
02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
have three kids in our family and I
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't think you know he struggled at
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
times to send us to private school
 
02:12:20.639 --> 02:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
times to send us to private school
occasionally

02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
02:12:23.709 --> 02:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
and it was uh very difficult for my
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
family to do so but when we were in a
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
district that had bad schools that's
 
02:12:31.589 --> 02:12:31.599 align:start position:0%
what he did but then later he went to
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
you know send us to college and that was
 
02:12:37.709 --> 02:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
just incredibly hard for him so you know
 
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
you don't get to save any money uh for
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
your kids college education if you're
 
02:12:47.549 --> 02:12:47.559 align:start position:0%
putting that into private school and so
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
it's very very bad uh very very
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
difficult for parents to send their kids
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
to private school um also
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know I think that's all that I
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to say you know also I I I find
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
that I've been researching uh the spike
 
02:13:08.719 --> 02:13:09.870 align:start position:0%
that I've been researching uh the spike
of

02:13:09.870 --> 02:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:13:12.990 --> 02:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
transgenderism okay uh just this one
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
last thing is that
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
um the Gen ZZ uh population is
 
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
their their um transgenderism went up
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
by uh
 
02:13:30.189 --> 02:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
400% in 10 years I I think we're getting
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
off topic now well that it's not safe
 
02:13:35.189 --> 02:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
you're Bey on your time limit as well
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very very much uh hope
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
Spencer yes
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%

I support public schools that educate
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
the majority of our students while not a
 
02:14:12.030 --> 02:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
perfect system it is the system that
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
levels the playing field and offers an
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
education to all children regardless of

02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
public schools are also a Haven for much
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
needed social services that fall short
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
in communities today the pandemic
 
02:14:30.750 --> 02:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
magnified how much the public relies on
 
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.000 align:start position:0%

program divies up the limited funds the

state provides and makes it impossible
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
for school boards and
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities to budget and provide

Schools without depending on local State

dollars the imperfections the opposition
 
02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
speak of will not improve with defunding
 
02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
77% of students who received School
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
vouchers were already attending
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
non-public school institutions yet that
 
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
money still disappeared from public

school budgets parents have the right to
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
select an alternative path for their

children though not at the expense of
 
02:15:58.270 --> 02:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
other students education and taxpayers
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
wallets the more the state diverts
 
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
public school funding the more local
 
02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
communities will bear the cost when
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
already burdened by high property taxes
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
inflation and housing costs defunding
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
Public Schools make our state less
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
competitive as public schools build
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
strong communities this is why I urge
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
you to adequately fund public schools
 
02:16:21.629 --> 02:16:21.639 align:start position:0%

other education uh committee um and I
 
02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to uh testify but I saw a
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
quote this morning that uh set me off a
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
little bit uh the quote is it it always
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
has been part of their agenda to
 
02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
continue to remove the state safeguards
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
on children and to continue to give
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
parents more and more
 
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
control hm parents control um the
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in
 
02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
1925 uh so uh Pierce versus societ of
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
sisters said that uh the child is not a
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
mere creature of the
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
State uh Thomas soul I think put it best
 
02:17:46.830 --> 02:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh the basic question is not what is
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
best but who says what is best I believe
 
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
is in
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
parents um and that leads to parental
 
02:17:59.070 --> 02:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
accountability this program has the best
 
02:18:02.190 --> 02:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
form of accountability it's
 
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
parents if the parent is not satisfied
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
with their child's education they can
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
move to another education option that
 
02:18:12.669 --> 02:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
fits their child's
 
02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
needs that is not always the case with
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
parents attending a public school
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
um per perhaps um what we need to do is
 
02:18:29.230 --> 02:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
unlock the school house doors so that
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
all parents all children can find the
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
option that meets their needs and why is
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
that important because it creates
 
02:18:41.070 --> 02:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
competition and as we have seen study
 
02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
after study shows that when there is
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
school choice available Public Schools
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
improve um there was an analysis done
 
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
not long ago of 29 studies of that
 
02:18:58.349 --> 02:18:58.359 align:start position:0%
subject 26 found positive results in
 
02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
public schools one neutral and two found
 
02:19:03.359 --> 02:19:04.830 align:start position:0%

02:19:06.669 --> 02:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:19:10.270 --> 02:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh comes quickly doesn't it yes um I'd

02:19:59.950 --> 02:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
compliance audit um and the uh
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant is in the
 
02:20:04.990 --> 02:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
process of uh doing an audit I
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
understand okay quick followup and what
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
were the um what were the results of the
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
um the the state the New Hampshire
 
02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education did a monitoring
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
exercise compliance audit yeah and I was
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could you could talk a
 
02:20:22.349 --> 02:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
little bit about um I I don't have it
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
with me but I know that there were um a
 
02:20:28.510 --> 02:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
couple of issues identified in um one
 
02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
case um there were uh pay stubs used
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
instead of a tax return because of a
 
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
drastic change in income levels for the
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
family um several instances like that um
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
and I think there might be someone here
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
who has more uh information on the
 
02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
details um of the findings of that
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
report but uh I think that uh there were
 
02:20:52.349 --> 02:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
four find excuse me five findings four
 
02:20:55.469 --> 02:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
were readily corrected and one was uh is
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
in process because it requires a date
 
02:21:00.990 --> 02:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
change in the system okay and then and
 
02:21:02.349 --> 02:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
and in that
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring approximately what percentage
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
of the total number of efas were were
 
02:21:09.870 --> 02:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
examined during that monitor uh I
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
believe it was a a random sample of 50
 
02:21:17.469 --> 02:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
um accounts so approximately 1%
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
1% is that correct 50 over 5
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
I guess that's about right okay thank
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
you uh we will make sure that the
 
02:21:28.590 --> 02:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
compliance report is available in
 
02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
everybody's hands here on the committee
 
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
it's been out and the oversight
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
committee's also looked at that uh but
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
that will be made available represented
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
fellow do you have a question thank you
 
02:21:41.469 --> 02:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
um the state has minimum standards for
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
public schools about the courses that
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
need to be available in the
 
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
qualifications of teachers how do we how
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
can we know that parents parents who are
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
homeschooling uh even know what those
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
standards are and can't come anywhere
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
near Meeting those
 
02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
standards are you talking about
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
homeschool parents who have an education
 
02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
Freedom account or traditional
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
homeschool parents the well either the
 
02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
proposal is that there could be all of
 
02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:12.710 align:start position:0%
proposal is that there could be all of
them

02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:22:15.870 --> 02:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
so the U the education Freedom accounts
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the Bill's about so yeah the
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account um requires
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
um uh parents to guarantee that they
 
02:22:26.510 --> 02:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
will provide uh education for the
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
children in the basic core subjects
 
02:22:30.830 --> 02:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
including social
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
studies that's written into the
 
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
law further questions yeah and just a
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
little followup in terms of look th
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
those are the courses what about the
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
standards about what's supposed to be in
 
02:22:44.349 --> 02:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
the course the curriculum Frameworks
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the public schools use well yeah
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
let's talk about that um you know I get
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
a kick out of the accountability
 
02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
argument because um what are the state
 
02:22:58.030 --> 02:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
averages in proficiency levels um in my
 
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
district I think it's uh something like
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
54 for English and 44 for math but 96%
 
02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
of the students
 
02:23:10.030 --> 02:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
graduate what do those numbers tell you
 
02:23:13.150 --> 02:23:13.160 align:start position:0%
um just up the line in Conway the uh
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
proficiency scores are 20% so where is
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
um you you had a
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
followup so we're going to keep the wait
 
02:23:28.030 --> 02:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to keep the follow-ups
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
two each and you you've had that we have
 
02:23:33.070 --> 02:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
a whole slug of people to come up here
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
so I
 
02:23:37.870 --> 02:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
got yes repan
 
02:23:40.110 --> 02:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
Brown representative some of the
 
02:23:41.950 --> 02:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
placards outside mentioned religious
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
schools were supported by the program
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
would you mind commenting on that please
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes I did see that and I
 
02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
heard someone uh talk about separation
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
of church and state which appears
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
nowhere in our constitution it was a
 
02:23:57.550 --> 02:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
letter written by Thomas Jefferson that
 
02:24:01.950 --> 02:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
coined that phrase um in terms of money
 
02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
going to religious
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
Schools public money does not go to any
 
02:24:10.830 --> 02:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
school public money goes to
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
parents parents then with free Choice
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
direct that money to a religious school
 
02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
a non-religious school home School
 
02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:22.750 align:start position:0%
a non-religious school home School
whatever

02:24:22.750 --> 02:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:24:28.349 --> 02:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
concept that it becomes private money
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
goes back many years with constitutional
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
rulings um one that I know of um that I
 
02:24:38.349 --> 02:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
have with me uh zelman versus Simmons
 
02:24:41.950 --> 02:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
Harris 2002 let me quote from Chief
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
Justice William renquist the Ohio
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
program is entirely neutral with respect
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
to religion it provides benefits
 
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
directly to a wide spectrum of
 
02:24:54.510 --> 02:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
individuals it permits such individuals
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
to exercise genuine Choice among options
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
public private secular and religious the
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
program is there is therefore a program
 
02:25:08.429 --> 02:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
of true private choice that money is
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
directed for private Choice parental
 
02:25:14.110 --> 02:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
Choice um and that is reflected in the
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
most recent Supreme Court rulings uh um
 
02:25:21.070 --> 02:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
Espinosa versus Mont the Department of
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue and most recently uh Carson
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
versus May uh right here over in Maine
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh had similar rulings with respect to
 
02:25:33.469 --> 02:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
The Establishment Clause and the fact
 
02:25:37.309 --> 02:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
that if you provided money to uh any any
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
school to exclude to exclude religious
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
schools would be discrimination and
 
02:25:46.590 --> 02:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional further questions
 
02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:48.110 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional further questions
representa

02:25:48.110 --> 02:25:48.120 align:start position:0%

phrase the separation of church and
 
02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:25.960 align:start position:0%

just laid out um many might refer to
 
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
that Blain amendment in our constitution
 
02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
as a dead
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
letter um it is a term to indicate that
 
02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
it is a a statute that can no longer be
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
enforced uh I if if anyone would like to
 
02:26:55.950 --> 02:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
test it I know we have another bill

if anyone would like to test it I
 
02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
encourage them to file a lawsuit and

02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to one of four colleges that
 
02:27:31.870 --> 02:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
struck me as interesting that all four
 
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
of those colleges are under strict
 
02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
accreditation with high
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
standards uh reports that come out
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
anytime you want to see them not just on
 
02:27:47.269 --> 02:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
finances but on academic achievement
 
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
what they're accomplishing and I know
 
02:27:51.389 --> 02:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
because of been in higher education
 
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
repres Burton do you have a
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
question why wouldn't the schools that
 
02:28:01.389 --> 02:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
are getting efas also be subject to
 
02:28:04.349 --> 02:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
public scrutiny on their effectiveness
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
of their programs uh all the public ex
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
me all the private schools that um have
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh attendance from EF a kids have to be
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
um listed and approved by the Department
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
and let let me let me just mention also
 
02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
in regard to that in terms of private
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
schools um I heard someone mention
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
Philip's exitor um there was one child
 
02:28:33.550 --> 02:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
with an EFA going to Philips exitor and
 
02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
the difference between the EFA and the
 
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
tuition is made up by a scholarship from
 
02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:40.309 align:start position:0%
tuition is made up by a scholarship from
Philip

02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
Philip
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
exer just quick quick fall where can I
 
02:28:45.309 --> 02:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
find the reports on the performance of
 
02:28:47.710 --> 02:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
the schools uh that are getting
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
efas uh you'd have to contact the school
 
02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have an
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
accreditor uh yes but I'm not sure who
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
accredits um each of those schools thank
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
you is there another did you have a
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
followup go
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
to follow up on my prior question and
 
02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
response so just to be clear what is
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
your position on taxpayer dollars
 
02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
funding religious
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
schools uh taxpayer dollars go to
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
parents it then
 
02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
um the taxpayer
 
02:29:26.269 --> 02:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
dollars go to parents and in many cases
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's their own tax dollars that are
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
being used then in their accounts and it
 
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
is then a matter of private Choice
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
whether they send their child to a
 
02:29:38.349 --> 02:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
religious or non-religious school or
 
02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
other educational option so you're okay
 
02:29:42.990 --> 02:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
with taxpayer dollars funding religious
 
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
schools I'm okay with taxpayer dollars
 
02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
going to parents so that they can do
 
02:29:52.230 --> 02:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
find the best education option for their
 
02:29:54.190 --> 02:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
children further
 
02:29:58.990 --> 02:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes repr yes
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
Dan yeah I'm at the end of the line
 
02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
heard a previous uh speaker say that uh
 
02:30:12.309 --> 02:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
budgets of some uh public schools have
 
02:30:16.830 --> 02:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
been cut are you aware of any uh Public
 
02:30:19.469 --> 02:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
School budgets that are lower as a
 
02:30:22.429 --> 02:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
result of or since the implementation of
 
02:30:22.439 --> 02:30:23.550 align:start position:0%
result of or since the implementation of
this

02:30:23.550 --> 02:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
program um I I don't know if there was
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
an adjustment in hold harmless or
 
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grants but that
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
would be the only way that any um
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
adjustment of the amount has been uh
 
02:30:38.910 --> 02:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
done but I don't think that any public
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire or elsewhere in
 
02:30:45.070 --> 02:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
the nation has received less money then
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
that they are entitled to under state
 
02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
law under current existing state law
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions one last
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
question rap thank you very much um and
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
it sort of a followup of on represent
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
what I thought I heard representative
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
Maguire ask you which was school budgets
 
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
having having been cut so so not the not
 
02:31:11.230 --> 02:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
the state grants schools having been cut
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
because we we know from the the um the
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education report that 145
 
02:31:18.590 --> 02:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:31:22.030 --> 02:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
245 uh state grants to Municipal to T
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
cities and towns for schools were in
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
fact cut or are going to be in fact cut
 
02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
for uh for the coming year so um the the
 
02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
question I heard was was are you aware
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
of any budgets that were cut as a result
 
02:31:38.510 --> 02:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
of um the vure program I do know that
 
02:31:40.750 --> 02:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
when was it three years ago I think um
 
02:31:43.269 --> 02:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax
 
02:31:48.349 --> 02:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
which um requires $363 million to be cut
 
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
um we cut that to2 $63 million to have
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
to be collected from uh school districts
 
02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
and lowered the tax rate um accordingly
 
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
but how many local school
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
districts lowered their budgets based on
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
that less collection of swept money I
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
heard maybe there was one or two in
 
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
terms of State
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
budgets so so so so basically what I'm
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
hearing when you talk about school local
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
school budgets not being not being cut
 
02:32:25.070 --> 02:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
as a result of efas that that the efas
 
02:32:28.110 --> 02:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
have not developed any any tax savings
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
at the local level is that no no I I
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
think no there have been tax savings um
 
02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers um we're talking about
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
$5,200 in terms of an EFA account on
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
average whereas the local public school
 
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
district uh the current average is
 
02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
$21,000 in change uh per student so
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
there is a dramatic difference there we
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
got to follow the money problem though
 
02:32:57.309 --> 02:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
the represent luno you're going on with
 
02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions and fine you were having a
 
02:33:05.269 --> 02:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
sidebar there so no I wasn't having a
 
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
sidebar you were having a sidewalk so no
 
02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're done with the questioning here
 
02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much represent

Penza hi um thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
thank you committee for taking my
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
testimony today my name is Louise
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
Spencer I am from conquered New
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm also the co-founder of
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
the Ken Street Coalition which is an all
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer Grassroots advocacy
 
02:33:48.510 --> 02:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
organization one of our top priorities
 
02:33:51.469 --> 02:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
is uh public schools and making sure
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
that every child in New Hampshire has
 
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
access to the best public school
 
02:33:59.269 --> 02:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
education that they they can have um
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard some compelling stories here
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
today from people who uh children and
 
02:34:08.510 --> 02:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
some from children themselves who have
 
02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
um availed themselves of the EFA Voucher
 
02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:15.640 align:start position:0%
Program um but there are other stories
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
we're not hearing uh we're not hearing
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
from a lot of public public school
 
02:34:23.070 --> 02:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
students we're not hearing from public
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
school teachers and there's a reason for
 
02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
that they're in school and they're not
 
02:34:31.950 --> 02:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
able to be here and present but they
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
have compelling stories as well and I
 
02:34:40.269 --> 02:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
find when I hear the kind of ner
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
criticisms of public schools it really
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
breaks my heart because public schools
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
are so much to so many not only the
 
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
children that attend them but the
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
communities and the families and the
 
02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
response that they are failing over and
 
02:35:01.550 --> 02:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
over again I think doesn't take into
 
02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
account the real challenges our schools
 
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
have and the fact that our state has
 
02:35:11.230 --> 02:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
refused to adequately fund our schools
 
02:35:13.269 --> 02:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
and adequately fund the public education
 
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
of our kids so let's talk about school
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
vouchers sometime when our state has
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
already done that then we can have the
 
02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:20.510 align:start position:0%
already done that then we can have the
conversation

02:35:20.510 --> 02:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
conversation

02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
how the EFA program has changed my life
 
02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
helped me feel more confident because of
 
02:36:54.910 --> 02:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
it I got to join a swim program try new
 
02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
subjects and even learn to sew and play
 
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
the accordion not every kid gets to do
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
things like that and it makes me really
 
02:37:02.349 --> 02:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
happy to play the accordion with my
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%

practices Universal eligibility could

incentivize the use of efas for private

schools that do not follow inclusive
 
02:39:38.429 --> 02:39:38.439 align:start position:0%
mandates research shows that families
 
02:39:39.870 --> 02:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
may feel pressured to accept schools
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
that only offer self-contained and
 
02:39:43.230 --> 02:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
specialized classrooms rather than
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
inclusive settings where students with
 
02:39:46.030 --> 02:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities can learn alongside their
 
02:39:48.349 --> 02:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
peers school choice programs often
 
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
exacerbate in inequities for families

from lower income backgrounds
 
02:39:53.670 --> 02:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
particularly those with students who
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
have disabilities um for example private
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
schools participating EFA programs may
 
02:39:58.990 --> 02:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
not disclose their capacity to support
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities leaving
 
02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
families with incomplete information
 
02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
when making enrollment decisions also
 
02:40:05.389 --> 02:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
Public Schools typically provide
 
02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
transportation as part of special
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
education services but many private
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
students private schools do not F
 
02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
further limiting access to inclusive
 
02:40:14.389 --> 02:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
options for low-income families thank
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
you further questions thank you sure
 
02:40:21.150 --> 02:40:21.160 align:start position:0%

02:40:25.030 --> 02:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
much so um so so thank you very much um
 
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Esposito for your testimony on this
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
and um and I believe AEL New Hampshire
 
02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
was uh was among some uh some groups out
 
02:40:36.790 --> 02:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
in front of the state house earlier this
 
02:40:40.429 --> 02:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
week um I was wondering if if you could
 
02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the um the
 
02:40:47.710 --> 02:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
the the recent reduction or pration in
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
the special education
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh Aid and what that means Statewide and
 
02:40:55.469 --> 02:40:55.479 align:start position:0%
compare that to the amount of money
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh that's being spent on
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
vouchers right now U represent luno now
 
02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to get into the catastrophic
 
02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
a special education a that is not part
 
02:41:07.710 --> 02:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
of this bill no no but it's I I think
 
02:41:11.110 --> 02:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's relevant to um to what um to what
 
02:41:15.309 --> 02:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
what Lewis was talking about if you can
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
wrap your response around the EFA Bill
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with hb11
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
five uh yes um thank you um I think our
 
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
rego's concern is inclusive education
 
02:41:28.389 --> 02:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
practices and when we cut funds um we
 
02:41:30.110 --> 02:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
are concerned about the different how
 
02:41:31.550 --> 02:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
that affects teachers within the
 
02:41:32.910 --> 02:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
classroom and the resources that they're
 
02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
provided um and you know research will
 
02:41:37.870 --> 02:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
show that inclusive education um is
 
02:41:39.230 --> 02:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
beneficial for not just special
 
02:41:40.750 --> 02:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
education students but also students
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
that are in the general education
 
02:41:45.790 --> 02:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
environment okay thank thank you further
 
02:41:49.309 --> 02:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
questions not see yes representative I
 
02:41:51.870 --> 02:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
wonder if you can help me um understand
 
02:41:53.710 --> 02:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
the difference between an EFA budget for
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
$4,000 and a state mandate to take a a
 
02:41:58.990 --> 02:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
school with extreme special needs and
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
send them out to Ohio for $250,000 that
 
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with this bill we are
 
02:42:05.469 --> 02:42:05.479 align:start position:0%
off the bill I'm not going there with
 
02:42:07.469 --> 02:42:07.479 align:start position:0%
that question no I'm not going there
 
02:42:11.070 --> 02:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
with that question um that's a whole div
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
pration of money and all this no no
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%

02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Owen blood and I am
 
02:44:04.469 --> 02:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
currently a senior at kirar Regional
 
02:44:06.510 --> 02:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
High School I'm here today to advocate
 
02:44:08.190 --> 02:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
for the support of public schools in New
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've been attending Public
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
School in this state since I was five
 
02:44:14.269 --> 02:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
and I can say that it has shaped me into
 
02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
who I am today without a public
 
02:44:18.429 --> 02:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
education system that provides a
 
02:44:20.429 --> 02:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
thorough diverse learning experience
 
02:44:22.469 --> 02:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
kids like me who rely on that system
 
02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
would not be the same people who we have
 
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
grown up to be I have had the incredible
 
02:44:29.230 --> 02:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn in public school
 
02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
and as a product of that system I feel
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
compelled to do everything in my power
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
to defend it in our state funding
 
02:44:37.710 --> 02:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
education is largely determined by
 
02:44:39.950 --> 02:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
District discretion I am fortunate to
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
reside in a district that takes
 
02:44:43.309 --> 02:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
education seriously so this hasn't
 
02:44:45.870 --> 02:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
greatly impacted me others however are
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
not so lucky and often face the direct
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
consequences from a lack of State
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
funding expanding the state Voucher
 
02:44:53.630 --> 02:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
Program would directly affect the scho
 
02:44:55.269 --> 02:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
the funding of schools which is already
 
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
notoriously low in districts that want
 
02:45:00.910 --> 02:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
to maintain a quality of Education
 
02:45:03.950 --> 02:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
they'd have to P place even more strain
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
on taxpayers at karge this issue is
 
02:45:09.429 --> 02:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
already apparent in the community a
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
citizen petition attempting to
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
drastically cut the school's budget due
 
02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
to high taxes was voted on at The
 
02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
District's deliberative session by
 
02:45:19.590 --> 02:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
placing the respond possibility of
 
02:45:21.990 --> 02:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
funding schools on individual districts
 
02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
you risk the collapse of public schools
 
02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
due to insufficient funding I urge all
 
02:45:29.550 --> 02:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
those considering support of hb15 to
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
think about what this would mean for the
 
02:45:33.469 --> 02:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
nearly 90% of students in New Hampshire
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
who are still enrolled in public schools
 
02:45:39.030 --> 02:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
reducing State funding for public
 
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
schools would lower the minimum level of
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
Education in New Hampshire a student can
 
02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
receive students in our state deserve
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
strong Equitable education system and
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
that starts with adequate funding of f
 
02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
Public Schools we must ensure that all
 
02:45:56.389 --> 02:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
students have the resources they need to
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
succeed thank you very good timing it's
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.230 --> 02:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
questions not see thank you very much
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%

02:46:18.349 --> 02:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
yeah well he's been back to the whole
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
time in that like that I don't let
 
02:46:23.389 --> 02:46:23.399 align:start position:0%
anybody talk where those things on and
 
02:46:25.110 --> 02:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
we've also at the door we've been trying
 
02:46:30.670 --> 02:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:48.190 --> 02:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
Penza she also has her daughter with
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:56.469 --> 02:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
welcome hi my name is Carmela Penza and
 
02:46:58.590 --> 02:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'm 17 years old and I live in Rochester
 
02:47:01.150 --> 02:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I've missed a great
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
deal of school as you can see due to a
 
02:47:05.389 --> 02:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
severe medical condition I cannot attend
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
a public or private school and I need
 
02:47:09.190 --> 02:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
one-on-one learning getting an EFA would
 
02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
greatly help my family so they could
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
hire a tutor so I can complete my high
 
02:47:12.479 --> 02:47:13.750 align:start position:0%
hire a tutor so I can complete my high
school

02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:47:16.030 --> 02:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
education as it stands now the amount of
 
02:47:17.550 --> 02:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
work my mom would have to do to be able
 
02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
to get the district to pay for
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
everything I need for my education would
 
02:47:23.150 --> 02:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
be an enormous amount of effort and
 
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
frankly a fight my mom several years ago
 
02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
fought for a boy named Tyler it took
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
almost 2 years in lawyers and they
 
02:47:31.309 --> 02:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
finally paid for his Services I was
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
little but I remember what my family
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
went through please pass HB 115 to help
 
02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.230 --> 02:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
me so I'm going to keep it short and
 
02:47:44.429 --> 02:47:44.439 align:start position:0%
sweet I strongly support the widely
 
02:47:48.870 --> 02:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
popular EFA program um I do have to say
 
02:47:51.389 --> 02:47:51.399 align:start position:0%
say that if this doesn't pass and it's
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
Universal or it gets amended um it has
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
to be fixed so it's not on gross income
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
it should be on taxable income because
 
02:48:01.150 --> 02:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
we would actually apply for this program
 
02:48:03.870 --> 02:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the $440,000 that we've
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
had to pay out of pocket for carmel's
 
02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:06.910 align:start position:0%
had to pay out of pocket for carmel's
medical

02:48:06.910 --> 02:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
expenses polling data shows that 72% of
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire parents support
 
02:48:16.429 --> 02:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
efas and we must put students over
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
in the future I would like to see the
 
02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
EFA program evolve into a more 529
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
savings plan model I think promoting
 
02:48:32.190 --> 02:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
transparency accountability fiscal
 
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
conservatism and school choice for all
 
02:48:37.510 --> 02:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
is something that all granted Staters
 
02:48:39.550 --> 02:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
will support and benefit from thank you
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you very much other
 
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%

parent and active member of the marac
 
02:49:31.950 --> 02:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
community I'm here to Mo voice my
 
02:49:33.229 --> 02:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
opposition of
 
02:49:35.710 --> 02:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
hb15 the existing voucher program is
 
02:49:38.469 --> 02:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
already available to families 350% of
 
02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
the poverty level and suffers from a
 
02:49:41.950 --> 02:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
lack of oversight and
 
02:49:44.190 --> 02:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
transparency while I support fam's
 
02:49:46.110 --> 02:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
ability to choose the best Avenue to
 
02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
educate their children I believe that
 
02:49:50.429 --> 02:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
public tax should be spent on public
 
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
schools public schools hire certified
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
teachers as well as have regulation and
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
oversight to ensure all students receive
 
02:50:00.389 --> 02:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
a free and appropriate public education
 
02:50:02.030 --> 02:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire public schools are
 
02:50:04.269 --> 02:50:04.279 align:start position:0%
already suffering from a lack of funding
 
02:50:06.670 --> 02:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
resulting in stretch staff and shortage
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
of personnel to provide critical support
 
02:50:12.110 --> 02:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
services to our most vulnerable children
 
02:50:14.229 --> 02:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
at a recent school budget committee a
 
02:50:16.030 --> 02:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
number of our residents were asking the
 
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
district to tighten its belt because
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
times are tough and Rising property
 
02:50:21.229 --> 02:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
taxes are threatening to price them out
 
02:50:24.349 --> 02:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
of their homes expanding the EFA program
 
02:50:26.269 --> 02:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
would increase the burden on our already
 
02:50:28.510 --> 02:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
overburden taxpayers while further
 
02:50:30.990 --> 02:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
undermining our Public Schools it seems
 
02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
to me that it's fiscally irresponsible
 
02:50:35.429 --> 02:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
and Reckless to expand this program when
 
02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been failing to comply
 
02:50:38.710 --> 02:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
with two New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:50:41.469 --> 02:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
rulings regarding its inequitable public
 
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
education funding practices thank you
 
02:50:46.349 --> 02:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:50:48.750 --> 02:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much there I don't
 
02:50:54.590 --> 02:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.950 --> 02:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:10.469 --> 02:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
Manion good afternoon my name is Jenna
 
02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
Karen and I'm here today to oppose
 
02:51:15.910 --> 02:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
hp15 the very Foundation of my
 
02:51:17.590 --> 02:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill stems from my
 
02:51:19.349 --> 02:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
success as a prodct of New Hampshire's
 
02:51:21.229 --> 02:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
Public Schools as a recent graduate from
 
02:51:23.790 --> 02:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
Sun Middle High School a month ago I
 
02:51:25.030 --> 02:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
completed my first semester at
 
02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
Bingington University the best public
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
university in New York where I'm
 
02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
thriving academically and actively
 
02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
participating in campus life and I
 
02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
consider sunap my New Hampshire Public
 
02:51:36.389 --> 02:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
School to be the main source of my
 
02:51:38.269 --> 02:51:38.279 align:start position:0%
accomplishments when I heard about and
 
02:51:40.710 --> 02:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
researched hb15 it became clear that
 
02:51:42.429 --> 02:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
this would effectively deface how New
 
02:51:44.550 --> 02:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire values education considering
 
02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
that it would significantly divert
 
02:51:48.030 --> 02:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
resources from public education
 
02:51:49.870 --> 02:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing the Integrity of schools
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
that enabled students like me to achieve
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
success hp15 fundamentally changes the
 
02:51:56.750 --> 02:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
program for one aimed at assisting
 
02:51:59.309 --> 02:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
families in need to one that prioritizes
 
02:52:01.229 --> 02:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
funding private education at the expense
 
02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
of public schools costing over $100
 
02:52:06.590 --> 02:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
million annually we're moving $ hundred
 
02:52:08.750 --> 02:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
million would move support for Vital
 
02:52:10.229 --> 02:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
programs like technical Education
 
02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
Centers special education School
 
02:52:14.670 --> 02:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
building aid and safety grants all of
 
02:52:17.150 --> 02:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
which serve 87% of New Hampshire
 
02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
students not to to mention over 75% of
 
02:52:21.990 --> 02:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
voucher recipients were never enrolled
 
02:52:24.229 --> 02:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
in public schools before receiving funds
 
02:52:25.710 --> 02:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
illustrating that this program is in
 
02:52:27.309 --> 02:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
primarily serving public students in
 
02:52:29.550 --> 02:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
need of alternative options but instead
 
02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
subsidizing private in homeschool
 
02:52:34.030 --> 02:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
education therefore the bill raises
 
02:52:35.429 --> 02:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
questions about accountability and
 
02:52:37.389 --> 02:52:37.399 align:start position:0%
equity for New Hampshire students it
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
outlines little oversight of these
 
02:52:40.710 --> 02:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
public funds no requirement for
 
02:52:42.590 --> 02:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
financial Audits and no mandatory
 
02:52:44.110 --> 02:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
assessments to ensure participating
 
02:52:46.830 --> 02:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
students receive an adequate education
 
02:52:48.510 --> 02:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
how can we trust that these alternative
 
02:52:50.030 --> 02:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
Educational Systems are providing the
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
education New Hampshire students of all
 
02:52:54.030 --> 02:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
backgrounds deserve with no State
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
oversight and students with disabilities
 
02:52:57.870 --> 02:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
W have critical protections under
 
02:52:59.469 --> 02:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
federal and state disability laws when
 
02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
they join this program sacrificing their
 
02:53:03.070 --> 02:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
right to services and indiv
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
individualized education plans which
 
02:53:07.790 --> 02:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
enable their success in the classroom
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
finally long-term studies show that
 
02:53:11.630 --> 02:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
voucher programs harm student outcomes
 
02:53:13.389 --> 02:53:13.399 align:start position:0%
participants score significantly lower
 
02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
in math and reading compared to their
 
02:53:17.309 --> 02:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
peers in public in public schools why
 
02:53:19.229 --> 02:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
should we expand a program with evidence
 
02:53:21.030 --> 02:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
of doing more harm than good rather than
 
02:53:23.870 --> 02:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
continue and increase and I'll just
 
02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
finish here increase investment in New
 
02:53:27.429 --> 02:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public schools which could
 
02:53:29.710 --> 02:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
address many of the remarks made by
 
02:53:32.269 --> 02:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
proponents of the spill overall as a
 
02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
student who values my education in the
 
02:53:36.389 --> 02:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
education of my friends family and
 
02:53:38.070 --> 02:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
future Generations in New Hampshire I
 
02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote against hp15
 
02:53:42.229 --> 02:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
and to continue supporting our Public
 
02:53:44.030 --> 02:53:44.040 align:start position:0%

Hall uh I'm here in support of hb15 and
 
02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
I'll keep this brief uh the EFA program
 
02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
success directly attribute is directly
 
02:54:25.070 --> 02:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
attributable to the free market force of
 
02:54:26.469 --> 02:54:26.479 align:start position:0%
providing Superior Products that A
 
02:54:29.150 --> 02:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
reduced cost due to competition contrast
 
02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
that with government school programs
 
02:54:32.269 --> 02:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
where the local taxpayers are burdened
 
02:54:34.750 --> 02:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
at upwards four times the cost per pupil
 
02:54:36.349 --> 02:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
with stagnant or even diminishing
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
returns on investment where local
 
02:54:40.229 --> 02:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
democracy decides the cost and
 
02:54:42.510 --> 02:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
individual choice is removed it's
 
02:54:44.670 --> 02:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
critically important that we expand on
 
02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
the winning strategy allowing the free
 
02:54:48.750 --> 02:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
market to do what it does best we don't
 
02:54:50.229 --> 02:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
means test for government School
 
02:54:51.870 --> 02:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
admission we shouldn't means test to
 
02:54:53.790 --> 02:54:53.800 align:start position:0%
allow parents the option to enter the
 
02:54:55.550 --> 02:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
education Marketplace outside of the
 
02:54:57.790 --> 02:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
government system I ask that you vote

Hampshire where last year we cut 27
 
02:56:28.030 --> 02:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
positions due to unfunded cost beyond
 
02:56:30.190 --> 02:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
what we could afford if they had gone
 
02:56:32.349 --> 02:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
through our personal tax would have been
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
at least $3,000 more mine I am a retired

most of my career one of my duties as a
 
02:57:02.110 --> 02:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
special ed teacher was evaluating
 
02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
homeschool students back in the day when
 
02:57:07.389 --> 02:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
that was required one year I evaluated a
 
02:57:10.110 --> 02:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
first grader was somewhere around March
 
02:57:12.190 --> 02:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
I was using the test we normally use it
 
02:57:14.309 --> 02:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
was immediately clear clear she could
 
02:57:16.269 --> 02:57:16.279 align:start position:0%
not read so I started her at the
 
02:57:19.830 --> 02:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
kindergarten level she my cues to read
 
02:57:21.870 --> 02:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
and probably learned more about reading
 
02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
during that session than her previous
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
months with her mother testing at that
 
02:57:27.910 --> 02:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
level would have put in our remedial
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
program with onetoone help this was just
 
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
one example of why we need to evaluate
 
02:57:36.550 --> 02:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
all students not just public school
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
students most of my skills I learned
 
02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
from for the private school job but they
 
02:57:43.630 --> 02:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
were easily transferable to my
 
02:57:46.030 --> 02:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent public job tuitions for
 
02:57:48.469 --> 02:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
students at the private school many many
 
02:57:50.670 --> 02:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
times the school cost were borne by
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
public schools who failed their students
 
02:57:55.429 --> 02:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
imagine if we continue down this road
 
02:57:58.670 --> 02:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
and C cut special ed support education
 
02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
support and face lawsuits by failed
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
students comparable to the sununu center
 
02:58:06.309 --> 02:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
suits today I oppose the use of public
 
02:58:08.910 --> 02:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
funds for private use and no
 
02:58:11.710 --> 02:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
accountability and support for more
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
money for public
 
02:58:16.269 --> 02:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
schools um I especially appeal to my
 
02:58:19.910 --> 02:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative mahagan that he support
 
02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
um our public school budget and not
 
02:58:27.269 --> 02:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
spending public money for private

and I'm a resident of marac New
 
02:58:59.670 --> 02:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here in opposition of
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
the HB 115 I have two children in the
 
02:59:06.229 --> 02:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
public education and one of them is in
 
02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
special education as our public school
 
02:59:10.710 --> 02:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
districts are currently going through
 
02:59:12.670 --> 02:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
budget season with even less State
 
02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
funding and facing detrimental Cuts this
 
02:59:18.110 --> 02:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
bill will continue to take away money
 
02:59:20.910 --> 02:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
from public education expanding School
 
02:59:23.229 --> 02:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
voucher eligibility for all students
 
02:59:25.710 --> 02:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of family income could cost
 
02:59:30.870 --> 02:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
the state approximately 120 120 $ 102
 
02:59:35.070 --> 02:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
million in the 2526 school year alone
 
02:59:37.550 --> 02:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
according to a new study by reaching
 
02:59:40.229 --> 02:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
higher ed uh higher New Hampshire this
 
02:59:43.309 --> 02:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
would deplete our education trust fund
 
02:59:46.910 --> 02:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
which is projected to have 125 million
 
02:59:50.590 --> 02:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal year 2025 that is
 
02:59:55.269 --> 02:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
84% of our current fund spent just on
 
02:59:55.279 --> 02:59:55.990 align:start position:0%
84% of our current fund spent just on
the

02:59:55.990 --> 02:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:59:59.910 --> 02:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
efas edel but recently said he would be
 
03:00:02.349 --> 03:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
working with lawmakers to pass a bill to
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
support District's special education
 
03:00:08.349 --> 03:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
expenses but passing HP 115 would leave
 
03:00:10.990 --> 03:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
no money for those students and that
 
03:00:13.710 --> 03:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
would increase the taxpayers burden this
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
is not fair to the children receiving
 
03:00:18.670 --> 03:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
special education and your state
 
03:00:21.710 --> 03:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
obligation to public education properly
 
03:00:23.910 --> 03:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
funding special education and public
 
03:00:26.550 --> 03:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
education should be the first priority
 
03:00:28.790 --> 03:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not opposed to the current EFA
 
03:00:31.229 --> 03:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
program that has income limits I am
 
03:00:33.990 --> 03:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to this change those of us that
 
03:00:36.070 --> 03:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
are using public education should not
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
have to suffer more funding cuts and
 
03:00:40.750 --> 03:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
increases in our taxes for those that
 
03:00:42.750 --> 03:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
have the privilege to use home school
 
03:00:45.670 --> 03:00:45.680 align:start position:0%

expand education Freedom accounts to
 
03:01:38.190 --> 03:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
every student in New Hampshire we
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
believe that every child is unique and
 
03:01:42.670 --> 03:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
with that comes different learning needs
 
03:01:44.229 --> 03:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
families know their children's needs
 
03:01:46.429 --> 03:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
better than anyone else and empowering

difference in their lives expanding efas
 
03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
to every student is not just about
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
providing options but it's about
 
03:01:59.790 --> 03:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
removing barriers to opportunity and
 
03:02:01.469 --> 03:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
giving them the room to
 
03:02:04.309 --> 03:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
thrive as a New Hampshire native I have
 
03:02:06.190 --> 03:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
a deep appreciation for the unique
 
03:02:08.110 --> 03:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
character of our state and the strong
 
03:02:10.510 --> 03:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
sense of community that defines it this
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
is where I grew up and it's where I've
 
03:02:14.750 --> 03:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
chosen to build my life in my career
 
03:02:16.750 --> 03:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
many of my friends from childhood left
 
03:02:18.790 --> 03:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
the state for college and didn't come
 
03:02:21.269 --> 03:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
back because of the High Cost of Living
 
03:02:23.309 --> 03:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
of the friends who have stayed many of
 
03:02:24.990 --> 03:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
them are now growing their families and
 
03:02:27.309 --> 03:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
sending their children off to school
 
03:02:29.150 --> 03:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
this has led to numerous conversations
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
about the education options in the state
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
and one thing has become clear from
 
03:02:35.469 --> 03:02:35.479 align:start position:0%
these conversations giving parents the
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
choice to find an education option that
 
03:02:40.269 --> 03:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
works for their family is a crucial
 
03:02:41.670 --> 03:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
factor in their decisions about whether
 
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
or stay in New Hampshire those friends
 
03:02:45.790 --> 03:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
who stayed here after college are
 
03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
struggling to balance the High Cost of
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
Living New Hampshire while also finding
 
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
an educational environment that allows
 
03:02:54.030 --> 03:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
their child to succeed these families
 
03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
are looking for options and want the
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
best for their children even if that
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
means moving out of state one of my
 
03:03:01.349 --> 03:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
friends is currently expecting her
 
03:03:03.870 --> 03:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
second child and with a growing family
 
03:03:05.550 --> 03:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to choose an education for
 
03:03:07.590 --> 03:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
her family and also afford to stay in
 
03:03:09.870 --> 03:03:09.880 align:start position:0%

03:03:11.870 --> 03:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
to make tough decisions for her family
 
03:03:13.229 --> 03:03:13.239 align:start position:0%

for the youngest purchase a home and
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%

03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
proposed bill will impact them um in
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
November uh of last year the education
 
03:04:57.870 --> 03:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
commission commissioner announced a
 
03:05:01.469 --> 03:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
severe cut in state aid to special
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
education the aid is being cut from um
 
03:05:09.469 --> 03:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
98.3% of the cost in
 
03:05:12.950 --> 03:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
2023 to TW to
 
03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
67.5% in this year this creates a
 
03:05:19.389 --> 03:05:19.399 align:start position:0%
particularly hard hardship for schools
 
03:05:22.269 --> 03:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
in rural areas because many of them do
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
not possess the services required to
 
03:05:28.630 --> 03:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
meet uh Federal mandates for special
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
education and so they have to contract
 
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
for these with ad Jason school districts
 
03:05:37.389 --> 03:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
or have private providers and then they
 
03:05:40.469 --> 03:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
have to transport the students to those
 
03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
locations um currently schools are
 
03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
$70,000 per student costs and the state
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
contributes to anything in excess of
 
03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
this commissioner Ed Adel blut has not
 
03:05:57.150 --> 03:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
requested an increase in the state
 
03:06:01.030 --> 03:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
special education budget since 2021 even
 
03:06:03.190 --> 03:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
though the costs have clearly
 
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
increased the
 
03:06:08.349 --> 03:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
33.9% million that was allotted last
 
03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
year had already received $50 million of
 
03:06:15.389 --> 03:06:15.399 align:start position:0%
request from school districts by October
 
03:06:18.429 --> 03:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
1st of last year less than a month into
 
03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
the school
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
year um commissioner Adel claims to have
 
03:06:26.910 --> 03:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
no solution to the uh budget dilemma but
 
03:06:30.550 --> 03:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
he believes that but vouchers may be the
 
03:06:33.750 --> 03:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
solution a very simple search on my part
 
03:06:36.269 --> 03:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
revealed the FCI justness of this
 
03:06:39.990 --> 03:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
reasoning number one uh a large p a
 
03:06:42.070 --> 03:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
number of research studies conducted
 
03:06:44.229 --> 03:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
between 2008 and
 
03:06:47.229 --> 03:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
2018 find no improvement in student
 
03:06:50.429 --> 03:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
achieve a m when vouchers are used some
 
03:06:52.750 --> 03:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
of the agencies conducting these studies
 
03:06:55.630 --> 03:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
were the economic policy Institute the
 
03:06:57.910 --> 03:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
National Bureau of economic research and
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
the institute for uh educational
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
Sciences secondly the voucher system has
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
already exceeded its uh initial estimate
 
03:07:11.309 --> 03:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
and cost so I will not get to the third
 
03:07:13.389 --> 03:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
point which is that most private schools
 
03:07:16.750 --> 03:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
do not provide any uh special ed
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
services they're not not mandated to do
 
03:07:22.229 --> 03:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
so why would New Hampshire validate such
 
03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
an expensive Venture when it has no
 
03:07:27.710 --> 03:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
proven positive outcome thank
 
03:07:31.110 --> 03:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
you uh a
 
03:07:34.349 --> 03:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
question I don't know do you want to
 
03:07:38.030 --> 03:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
questions quick question thank you very
 
03:07:44.510 --> 03:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
much yeah you can come back to the um no
 
03:07:47.030 --> 03:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank thank thank you very much um Miss
 
03:07:50.510 --> 03:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
fence um would the um would the $27
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
million that was was spent on that's
 
03:07:55.110 --> 03:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
being spent on the voucher program this
 
03:07:58.190 --> 03:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
year cover the shortfall in um special
 
03:08:01.389 --> 03:08:01.399 align:start position:0%
education Aid that you were referring to
 
03:08:04.670 --> 03:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
I I can't answer that I don't know um
 
03:08:07.229 --> 03:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
apparently the special voucher program
 
03:08:10.229 --> 03:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
is administered by a private agency and
 
03:08:12.910 --> 03:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
according to the education commissioner
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
can't be audited because of this so okay
 
03:08:20.990 --> 03:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
how much transparency of data there is
 
03:08:23.229 --> 03:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
03:08:42.870 --> 03:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman and members
 
03:08:46.510 --> 03:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee I appreciate the
 
03:08:48.469 --> 03:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you today about
 
03:08:50.830 --> 03:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
Universal education Freedom accounts my
 
03:08:53.070 --> 03:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
name is Adam hsto and I'm a resident of
 
03:08:55.150 --> 03:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
Hudson my wife and I have two young
 
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
children my almost 5-year-old daughter
 
03:08:59.190 --> 03:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
starts kindergarten this fall and my
 
03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
three-year-old son will start in Fall of
 
03:09:04.670 --> 03:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
2027 which is in two years we would like
 
03:09:06.389 --> 03:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
to send our children to a local private
 
03:09:08.349 --> 03:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
school in Hudson but unfortunately we
 
03:09:10.830 --> 03:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
don't qualify for an EA this is because
 
03:09:12.429 --> 03:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
our income is slightly above the current
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements for
 
03:09:17.469 --> 03:09:17.479 align:start position:0%
efas as we consider the future of educ
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
ation in our state I urge you to support
 
03:09:21.070 --> 03:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
Universal education Freedom accounts a
 
03:09:22.550 --> 03:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
program that empowers parents to make
 
03:09:24.830 --> 03:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
the best education choices for their
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
children by providing a flexible
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
education funding system efas give
 
03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
parents the freedom to choose the best
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
education for their child whether that's
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
a traditional public school private
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
school or home school this approach will
 
03:09:39.870 --> 03:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
improve academic outcomes increase
 
03:09:41.710 --> 03:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
efficiency and promote accountability in
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
the education system efas promote
 
03:09:46.670 --> 03:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency by allowing parents to direct
 
03:09:48.309 --> 03:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
education funding to the schools and
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
programs that best meet their child's
 
03:09:52.349 --> 03:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
needs by giving parents more control
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
over education funding efas increase
 
03:09:56.429 --> 03:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency in the
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
education system education shouldn't be
 
03:10:01.870 --> 03:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
dependent on zip code or income it
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
should be based upon what parents beli
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of their child I
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
believe that Universal education Freedom
 
03:10:09.790 --> 03:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
accounts are a critical step toward
 
03:10:11.710 --> 03:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
creating a more Equitable and Effective
 
03:10:14.110 --> 03:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
Education System in New Hampshire I urge
 
03:10:16.110 --> 03:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
you to support this legislation and give
 
03:10:17.630 --> 03:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
all parents the freedom to ch choose the
 
03:10:19.550 --> 03:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
best education for their children thank
 
03:10:21.550 --> 03:10:21.560 align:start position:0%

03:10:24.990 --> 03:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you is
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:37.389 --> 03:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
here all right sorry I'm a little
 
03:10:39.950 --> 03:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
disheveled here I came from uh from work
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm representative Ross bar I
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of wear and gtown I
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
was watching the um committee remote so
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
I don't need to reiterate a lot of the
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
points uh but I would like to raise some
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
things um especially to my colleagues on
 
03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
the other side of the aisle you do not
 
03:10:56.950 --> 03:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
income test a public school this is
 
03:10:56.960 --> 03:10:57.750 align:start position:0%
income test a public school this is
public

03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
education so I don't know why we would
 
03:11:03.790 --> 03:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
start applying a income test now no one
 
03:11:05.469 --> 03:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
says anything when a family making a
 
03:11:07.150 --> 03:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars goes to public school no
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
one says oh my God you're hurting the
 
03:11:13.229 --> 03:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um they view it as a duty
 
03:11:15.510 --> 03:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
education should be about funding
 
03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
students not systems
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
um I am the byproduct of both public and
 
03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
private school I was pulled out of
 
03:11:25.469 --> 03:11:25.479 align:start position:0%
public school um because it did not meet
 
03:11:28.030 --> 03:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
my needs as a child my parents then put
 
03:11:30.269 --> 03:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
me into private school and then my dad
 
03:11:31.710 --> 03:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
lost his job he was the only income
 
03:11:35.229 --> 03:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
earner in my family and um you know this
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
is right around Middle School not a
 
03:11:39.670 --> 03:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
great time for teenagers and I remember
 
03:11:42.990 --> 03:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
very very very tough conversations and
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
let's call it arguments and yelling
 
03:11:46.150 --> 03:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
about whether they were going to pay the
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
mortgage or pay for my schooling so you
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
guys have an opportunity here to do real
 
03:11:55.950 --> 03:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
good the money belongs to the student uh
 
03:11:57.469 --> 03:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
people raise objections about I don't
 
03:11:59.070 --> 03:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
want my tax dollars going to a private
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
school I don't care where you send my
 
03:12:03.190 --> 03:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
education tax dollars I want them to
 
03:12:04.590 --> 03:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
follow the student if that goes to a
 
03:12:06.790 --> 03:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
private school so be it I had a friend
 
03:12:07.870 --> 03:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
of mine on the other side of the aisle
 
03:12:09.790 --> 03:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
said would you be okay if this money
 
03:12:12.309 --> 03:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
went to a school and isamic school like
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
trying to poke some religious bigotry
 
03:12:16.110 --> 03:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
out of me they were kind of stunned when
 
03:12:17.630 --> 03:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
I said I'd have no problem with that if
 
03:12:19.389 --> 03:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
that's what the parent wants to do
 
03:12:21.710 --> 03:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's the parents business parents
 
03:12:23.469 --> 03:12:23.479 align:start position:0%
should raise their children as they see
 
03:12:25.309 --> 03:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
fit even if I disagree with that they
 
03:12:26.990 --> 03:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
should raise their children as I as they

taxpayers is for the student so I won't
 
03:12:35.670 --> 03:12:35.680 align:start position:0%

much representative Barry so so you
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
talked about um uh the equivalency of um
 
03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
of what should be vouchers and um having
 
03:13:02.790 --> 03:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
having no um no eligibility requirement
 
03:13:05.309 --> 03:13:05.319 align:start position:0%
the same way um the same way as we have
 
03:13:08.950 --> 03:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
currently for for public schools but um
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
would I guess would you support an
 
03:13:14.309 --> 03:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
amendment to um uh to this bill that
 
03:13:16.510 --> 03:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
would put some accountability some
 
03:13:19.630 --> 03:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
testing some data sharing and an annual
 
03:13:22.590 --> 03:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
state audit reporting requirement into
 
03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
um into the voucher program yeah well
 
03:13:25.750 --> 03:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
let's talk about accountability real
 
03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
fast no no let's answer the question no
 
03:13:30.030 --> 03:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
no I'm allowed to answer as I see fit
 
03:13:31.590 --> 03:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
let's answer I'm allowed to answer as I
 
03:13:33.150 --> 03:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
see fit so you guys bring up
 
03:13:34.870 --> 03:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
accountability all the time as you know
 
03:13:36.429 --> 03:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
I used to represent the south side of
 
03:13:38.710 --> 03:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester Mr chair the question was
 
03:13:40.630 --> 03:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
represent luno you asked about
 
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
accountability he is responding to you
 
03:13:44.429 --> 03:13:44.439 align:start position:0%
on accountability he'll get to where you
 
03:13:47.469 --> 03:13:47.479 align:start position:0%
want to be okay thank you thank you so I
 
03:13:48.750 --> 03:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
would ask ask this question so in
 
03:13:51.429 --> 03:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
Manchester you have Ela uh and math
 
03:13:55.389 --> 03:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
proficiencies in the teens in the teens
 
03:13:58.269 --> 03:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
who's accountable for that and I
 
03:13:59.389 --> 03:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
understand that this is the perjorative
 
03:14:01.150 --> 03:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
that is constantly thrown calling it a
 
03:14:02.550 --> 03:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
voucher program trying to drive the
 
03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
program into the ground saying it's
 
03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
unaccountable the money belongs to the
 
03:14:09.469 --> 03:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
child so you can sit there and push
 
03:14:10.670 --> 03:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
forward in the amendment all you want
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
and say all you want if you're going to
 
03:14:13.870 --> 03:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
make an accountability argument
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative my Counterpoint would be
 
03:14:17.550 --> 03:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
I would start with the failing school
 
03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
systems first which cost five times as
 
03:14:21.469 --> 03:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
much as this program
 
03:14:23.910 --> 03:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
does are there further questions well he
 
03:14:25.229 --> 03:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
he didn't get to the answer of my
 
03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
question you have a followup so so so
 
03:14:29.750 --> 03:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
would you would you support an annual
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
audit uh performance an annual state
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
performance audit on the um the voucher
 
03:14:36.990 --> 03:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
program I I would start with if you want
 
03:14:38.269 --> 03:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
to talk about accountability which is
 
03:14:39.630 --> 03:14:39.640 align:start position:0%
your point I would start with holding
 
03:14:41.229 --> 03:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
the public schools accountable first the
 
03:14:42.269 --> 03:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
money belongs to the students I'm
 
03:14:43.870 --> 03:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
talking about an audit the the public
 
03:14:45.630 --> 03:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
schools are a the money is very well the
 
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
money is very well accounted for now
 
03:14:50.110 --> 03:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any are
 
03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
there any other
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank oh yes represent fellows
 
03:14:56.670 --> 03:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh you're the second
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
person I've heard refer to you know the
 
03:15:01.870 --> 03:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
money belongs to the child and you don't
 
03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
want to fund
 
03:15:07.229 --> 03:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
systems so what is this I don't quite
 
03:15:09.710 --> 03:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
understand not funding systems does that
 
03:15:11.630 --> 03:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
mean that that you don't think the
 
03:15:13.229 --> 03:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
federal government should pay for the
 
03:15:15.910 --> 03:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
military to to protect our country that
 
03:15:17.870 --> 03:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like a system
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know do you think that the town
 
03:15:24.030 --> 03:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't um fund police or or Public
 
03:15:26.910 --> 03:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
Works should everybody get the money to
 
03:15:29.910 --> 03:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
maintain the roads that they live on how
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
does that work I don't understand this
 
03:15:34.590 --> 03:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
concept yeah Happ to clarify for you um
 
03:15:36.670 --> 03:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
there are members of this legislature
 
03:15:38.429 --> 03:15:38.439 align:start position:0%
who prioritize the system over the
 
03:15:39.870 --> 03:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
student so doesn't mean you don't
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
properly fund school systems but the
 
03:15:44.590 --> 03:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
student should be the priority and I
 
03:15:45.870 --> 03:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
think that's a key difference that's one
 
03:15:47.349 --> 03:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
of the things I love this bill is makes
 
03:15:49.590 --> 03:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
the student and the parent the priority
 
03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
over the system and I will always be I
 
03:15:54.229 --> 03:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
will always have the backs of students
 
03:15:56.269 --> 03:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
and parents before the system when it
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
comes to education the order of
 
03:16:00.750 --> 03:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
operations is very simple students
 
03:16:03.870 --> 03:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
parents system not the other way around
 
03:16:06.910 --> 03:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
students parents
 
03:16:11.070 --> 03:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
system thank you very much further
 
03:16:14.910 --> 03:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
questions pardon me oh yes you're
 
03:16:16.269 --> 03:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
blending right in with all the other
 
03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
traffic that
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
I know I feel like I'm a part of the
 
03:16:22.830 --> 03:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
crowd here um thank you Mr chair you're
 
03:16:27.469 --> 03:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
welcome and oh jeez thank you Mr chair
 
03:16:29.710 --> 03:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
um there's this bill is about
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility and Universal eligibility um
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
in in my free time one of the things
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
that I do is I'm a volunteer um who does
 
03:16:42.309 --> 03:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
SNAP Outreach and so I talk to people
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
about we're not really hearing you on
 
03:16:46.429 --> 03:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
the other side really get close to that
 
03:16:50.550 --> 03:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
mik so I do snap Outreach and education
 
03:16:52.950 --> 03:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
across the state and the first question
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
that I get when I talk to people is what
 
03:16:56.750 --> 03:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
are the income
 
03:16:58.830 --> 03:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines and we've heard a lot of
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
stories today about people who are just
 
03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
over the guidelines for um for the
 
03:17:07.309 --> 03:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
vouchers and that happens all the time
 
03:17:09.550 --> 03:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
for SNAP so I guess my question to you
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
is would you be in favor of eliminating
 
03:17:14.830 --> 03:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
income eligibility for programs like
 
03:17:18.510 --> 03:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
Snap and tanif and and fuel
 
03:17:20.830 --> 03:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
assistance um well I can't speak to
 
03:17:22.349 --> 03:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
those programs specifically but I think
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
more to Broad your question about uh I
 
03:17:26.790 --> 03:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
believe they're called um benefit Cliffs
 
03:17:28.469 --> 03:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
right income Cliffs and I deal with this
 
03:17:30.030 --> 03:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
a lot actually in the childcare space
 
03:17:32.349 --> 03:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
where we have a state scholarship which
 
03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
is kept up at 350% it's actually the
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
same income level right now as an EFA um
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
and I deal with that all the time with
 
03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
parents uh who fall off they're at the
 
03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
they're at the 360 or uh worse actually
 
03:17:45.670 --> 03:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
probably the worst thing is they're a
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
small business owner and you look at
 
03:17:49.070 --> 03:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
gross income and not net income uh and
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
you disqualify a lot of a lot of small
 
03:17:52.229 --> 03:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
business owners who actually would make
 
03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
it if you look at their net income but
 
03:17:56.710 --> 03:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
anyways that's neither here nor there um
 
03:18:00.870 --> 03:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
this is about education and you know the
 
03:18:02.349 --> 03:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
state constitution says we should
 
03:18:05.469 --> 03:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
cherish education and I view that as a
 
03:18:07.830 --> 03:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional Duty so uh I don't see
 
03:18:09.389 --> 03:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
anything in there about snap or the
 
03:18:10.750 --> 03:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
state constitution or those other
 
03:18:13.150 --> 03:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
programs um so I guess my answer would
 
03:18:13.160 --> 03:18:14.630 align:start position:0%
programs um so I guess my answer would
be

03:18:14.630 --> 03:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:18:17.790 --> 03:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
no thank you further questions
 
03:18:19.630 --> 03:18:19.640 align:start position:0%

03:19:03.840 --> 03:19:04.590 align:start position:0%
you see is the role of public schools in
our

03:19:04.590 --> 03:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
democracy at the close of our
 
03:19:09.189 --> 03:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
conversation in December 2019 the
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner told me that he believed
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
that public dollars should pay for
 
03:19:16.030 --> 03:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
private education and that I did not
 
03:19:18.870 --> 03:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
believe this he was correct I believe
 
03:19:20.830 --> 03:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
what Thomas Jefferson and other founding
 
03:19:23.550 --> 03:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
fathers believed that participation in a
 
03:19:25.710 --> 03:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
democracy a form of government which
 
03:19:27.550 --> 03:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
respects the Divergent views of its
 
03:19:30.750 --> 03:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
citizens requires an educated populace
 
03:19:32.349 --> 03:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
this is why the public schools were
 
03:19:35.429 --> 03:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
established all of us present here today
 
03:19:36.990 --> 03:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that New Hampshire school
 
03:19:39.550 --> 03:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program takes tax dollars from
 
03:19:41.870 --> 03:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers like me and requires that I
 
03:19:43.469 --> 03:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
give these dollars to parents or
 
03:19:45.349 --> 03:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
Guardians to pay for the private
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
religious or homeschooling of their
 
03:19:49.309 --> 03:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
children applicants from for New
 
03:19:51.550 --> 03:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vouchers apply to a private
 
03:19:53.830 --> 03:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
organization which screens applicants
 
03:19:56.110 --> 03:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
and presumably ensur that all monies are
 
03:19:58.229 --> 03:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
properly spent the New Hampshire
 
03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistance assistant
 
03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
is required by Statute to do a
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
performance audit of New Hampshire
 
03:20:06.990 --> 03:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
school voucher program but the LBA is
 
03:20:08.910 --> 03:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
unable to do this because it has not
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
been given access to this information
 
03:20:13.510 --> 03:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
once School vouchers consisting of New
 
03:20:16.030 --> 03:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer dollars are awarded
 
03:20:18.229 --> 03:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers do not have any appreciable
 
03:20:20.510 --> 03:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
oversight on how their tax dollars are
 
03:20:23.429 --> 03:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
spent unlike taxes provided to our local
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
public schools the money taken from us
 
03:20:27.870 --> 03:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
as voucher dollars disappears from
 
03:20:30.870 --> 03:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer oversight this constitutes
 
03:20:33.309 --> 03:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
taxation without representation one of
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
the key reasons why the original 13
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
colonies revolted against Great Britain
 
03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
I believe a citizen's revolt against
 
03:20:42.910 --> 03:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
School vouchers should and eventually
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
will happen thank you thank you very

different needs and that there are many
 
03:21:58.030 --> 03:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
different ways of making sure that our
 
03:22:01.229 --> 03:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
kids have access to the education that
 
03:22:03.910 --> 03:22:03.920 align:start position:0%

Advocate specifically for

taxpayers as we heard in the governor's
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
inaugural address last week we have to
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
tighten our belts clearly we are looking
 
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
at budget cuts at the state state level
 
03:22:19.870 --> 03:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
and I know very well from firsthand
 
03:22:22.389 --> 03:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
experience as a city counselor that when
 
03:22:24.910 --> 03:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
Cuts happen at the state level local
 
03:22:27.790 --> 03:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes go up so on behalf of the
 
03:22:31.030 --> 03:22:31.040 align:start position:0%

committee I'm darus heny mother of six
 
03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
homeschool children and a former
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
nashille School Board member I'm here in
 
03:23:22.590 --> 03:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
opposition parents are frustrated with
 
03:23:24.550 --> 03:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
schools rightly so the legislature has
 
03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
destroyed them with costly and
 
03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
controversial regulation resulting in
 
03:23:30.269 --> 03:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
higher property taxes and no voice in
 
03:23:33.189 --> 03:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
public school that okay I will the
 
03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
legislature accepted Federal bribes on
 
03:23:37.150 --> 03:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
an ongoing basis to implement
 
03:23:39.429 --> 03:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
standard-based learning as if children
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
were Commodities to standardized well
 
03:23:43.750 --> 03:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's not working instead of creating a
 
03:23:45.630 --> 03:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
new entitlement the legislature should
 
03:23:47.950 --> 03:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
take responsib ability for the current
 
03:23:50.590 --> 03:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
situation regul the reg overregulation
 
03:23:53.070 --> 03:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
of public schools and restore local
 
03:23:55.710 --> 03:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
control but that's too difficult or it's
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
all the federal government's fault so we
 
03:23:59.189 --> 03:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
have to a new plan to provide State
 
03:24:01.389 --> 03:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
funding for every child rich or poor who
 
03:24:02.870 --> 03:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
attends private schooling to help them
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
get the best education best education
 
03:24:07.030 --> 03:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
really that I mean that's what they said
 
03:24:08.630 --> 03:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
about the public schools when they put
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
in all this regulation funding private
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
school is not a constitutional Duty
 
03:24:14.950 --> 03:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
under article 83 that's for public
 
03:24:17.389 --> 03:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
schools we are being being told that
 
03:24:19.630 --> 03:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
every school child learns differently
 
03:24:21.389 --> 03:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
really Public Schools were not allowed
 
03:24:23.550 --> 03:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
to treat children as individuals we are
 
03:24:25.830 --> 03:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
burdened with uniform standards uniform
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
assessments uniform compty based
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
education and uniform social emotional
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
learning which is behavior modification
 
03:24:34.870 --> 03:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's one-sized fits-all centralized
 
03:24:36.590 --> 03:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
control eliminating any real
 
03:24:38.590 --> 03:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
accountability no one's ever to blame
 
03:24:40.670 --> 03:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
nothing ever changes the schools fail
 
03:24:42.910 --> 03:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
they just get more funding the original
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
article six gave us an exclusive right
 
03:24:48.349 --> 03:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
over education I put that in I'll skip
 
03:24:50.110 --> 03:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
over it but it's in there for your
 
03:24:52.189 --> 03:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
review every public school is a
 
03:24:54.510 --> 03:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
corporate body not a body comma
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
corporate as they mutilated it in ' 68
 
03:25:00.189 --> 03:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
the state created teacher licensing for
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
public schools now it funds improves
 
03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
private schools without licensed
 
03:25:06.269 --> 03:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
teachers Tate created academic standards
 
03:25:08.030 --> 03:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
and mandates for public schools but
 
03:25:10.349 --> 03:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
funds private schools without those it
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
creates laws on employee labor standards
 
03:25:14.110 --> 03:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
for public schools and now funds
 
03:25:15.710 --> 03:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
improved private schools without such
 
03:25:15.720 --> 03:25:16.990 align:start position:0%
improved private schools without such
unions

03:25:16.990 --> 03:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
unions
 
03:25:18.990 --> 03:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
the state has required public has
 
03:25:21.189 --> 03:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
regulated public schools to death which
 
03:25:22.830 --> 03:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
is why public schools are failing and
 
03:25:24.750 --> 03:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
spending out of control the state
 
03:25:26.710 --> 03:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to cut costs
 
03:25:29.510 --> 03:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
deregulate the schools one other thing I
 
03:25:31.309 --> 03:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
just want to say that school choice is
 
03:25:32.790 --> 03:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
not a Grassroots movement like
 
03:25:35.670 --> 03:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
homeschooling it's an agenda pushed by
 
03:25:37.830 --> 03:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
Nationwide think tanks legislative
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
conferences and advocated by UNESCO
 
03:25:42.590 --> 03:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
which favors State control of Education
 
03:25:44.910 --> 03:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
to produce Global Citizens with values
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
attitudes and beliefs different from
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
those of their fames you gone beyond
 
03:25:51.070 --> 03:25:51.080 align:start position:0%

03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful wonderful
 
03:26:11.950 --> 03:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:14.429 --> 03:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
Lukie thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:26:15.910 --> 03:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I will be very
 
03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
brief because I believe this has been
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
pounded to death I would like to say 71
 
03:26:24.590 --> 03:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
years ago I was in a room they called it
 
03:26:27.870 --> 03:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
a first grade classroom however uh there
 
03:26:29.950 --> 03:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
was something that was missing the
 
03:26:32.070 --> 03:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
missing part of it was Miss Tui Miss Tui
 
03:26:35.429 --> 03:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
was sick all year uh Miss Tui did manage
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
to get through to her retirement 30 kids
 
03:26:40.269 --> 03:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
got the shaft and I'm hearing the
 
03:26:41.710 --> 03:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
stories from the kids earlier today and
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
the parents earlier today and the more
 
03:26:45.870 --> 03:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
things change the more things remain the
 
03:26:47.950 --> 03:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
same if the schools are failing if
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're failing one student then that
 
03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
student should be able to get an
 
03:26:53.550 --> 03:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
adequate and appropriate education
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
however is necessary um and if the
 
03:26:57.550 --> 03:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
public schools can't do it then we need
 
03:27:01.710 --> 03:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
an Escape Route thank you thank you very
 
03:27:10.670 --> 03:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:16.830 --> 03:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
there we
 
03:27:20.510 --> 03:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
go and the next person would be
 
03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative uh wood or Clayton
 
03:27:28.590 --> 03:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
wood I'm in support of the bill the
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
existing EFA laws and anything that
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
makes them more
 
03:27:34.990 --> 03:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
accessible and I'd like to use the rest
 
03:27:37.229 --> 03:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
of my time to talk about how to make it
 
03:27:37.239 --> 03:27:38.269 align:start position:0%
of my time to talk about how to make it
even

03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
even
 
03:27:41.110 --> 03:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
better I think there's a the problem
 
03:27:43.229 --> 03:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
with the existing EFA law is that it's
 
03:27:45.870 --> 03:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
not full replacement cost so parents
 
03:27:47.070 --> 03:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
have come
 
03:27:47.080 --> 03:27:48.950 align:start position:0%
have come
up

03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:27:51.630 --> 03:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
what the problem is that it's not full
 
03:27:54.990 --> 03:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
replacement cost uh to to fund the
 
03:27:58.189 --> 03:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
private school um and and then parents
 
03:28:00.269 --> 03:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
have to come up with money on their own
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
no matter what their income look the
 
03:28:04.910 --> 03:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
secondary problem is that the state
 
03:28:07.830 --> 03:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
revenue needs to be raised at the at the
 
03:28:11.830 --> 03:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
fund at the state level and the solution
 
03:28:14.630 --> 03:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
the punchline headline is town
 
03:28:17.469 --> 03:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
efas and if I use an example from my
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
town of marac uh the the town school
 
03:28:24.910 --> 03:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
budget is 93 mil 3600 students over
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
25,000 per student I look quickly on the
 
03:28:32.269 --> 03:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
EFA the the State website and found
 
03:28:34.229 --> 03:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
three neighboring schools Terry field
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
about 26k and Manchester that's a break
 
03:28:40.750 --> 03:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
even Trinity High School Manchester 15K
 
03:28:43.910 --> 03:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
Bedford Academy a k35 under 14k that
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
includes lunch
 
03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
the total school budget in marac is
 
03:28:52.469 --> 03:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
2third of the Town budget so making a
 
03:28:54.269 --> 03:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
significant reduction in the school
 
03:28:56.910 --> 03:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
budget would significantly reduce
 
03:28:56.920 --> 03:28:58.070 align:start position:0%
budget would significantly reduce
property

03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:29:01.070 --> 03:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
taxes so the details to
 
03:29:03.550 --> 03:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
consider towns decrease payments to
 
03:29:05.830 --> 03:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
school districts maybe mandate that as
 
03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
instantaneous or catch it in next year's
 
03:29:10.950 --> 03:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
budget towns could decide on the amount
 
03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
it could be a direct reimbursement to
 
03:29:15.870 --> 03:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
the school or a flat fee homeschooling
 
03:29:18.990 --> 03:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
could certainly be included in this the
 
03:29:21.349 --> 03:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
state infrastructure for efas Remains
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
the single payment from the town could
 
03:29:24.630 --> 03:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
go to that State office and they could
 
03:29:26.429 --> 03:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
administer all of
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
the payments to the individual places so
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
the punchline are your property taxes
 
03:29:35.710 --> 03:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
too high do you support school choice
 
03:29:39.510 --> 03:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
solve both problem at once support town
 
03:29:42.630 --> 03:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
efas thank you very much questions from
 
03:29:45.870 --> 03:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
the committee not seeing any uh Charles
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%

03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%

MTI if I'm pronouncing names just please
 
03:30:47.309 --> 03:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
let me know that I'm messing it up

03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Constitution to provide
 
03:31:03.630 --> 03:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
an adequate education for students that
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
goes into meeting the needs of
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
them through educational content Andor
 
03:31:09.840 --> 03:31:11.309 align:start position:0%
them through educational content Andor
other

03:31:11.309 --> 03:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
resources for those students who have
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
been homeschooling this entire time I
 
03:31:18.870 --> 03:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
myself as a taxpayer for 10 years before
 
03:31:21.510 --> 03:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
we were able to take advantage of the
 
03:31:24.429 --> 03:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
EFA program I now very much appreciate
 
03:31:26.670 --> 03:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
that the tax dollars I paid for 10 years
 
03:31:28.950 --> 03:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
are now coming back to me so that I can
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education for my
 
03:31:33.870 --> 03:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
children one I've heard a whole lot of
 
03:31:35.870 --> 03:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
testimony today going back and forth on
 
03:31:37.710 --> 03:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
both sides one thing that has not been
 
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
addressed is that the people against
 
03:31:43.070 --> 03:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
this particular bill will be funded no
 
03:31:46.590 --> 03:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
matter what the people for it will not
 
03:31:49.590 --> 03:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
the people who are hoping to become
 
03:31:51.990 --> 03:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
funded by an expansion of the EFA
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
program will not have another choice for
 
03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
their adequate funding they are counting
 
03:32:00.790 --> 03:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
on you all to do what you did for me
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
last year which was expand it to
 
03:32:05.189 --> 03:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
350% there's a whole lot of students
 
03:32:07.309 --> 03:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
that I teach that would really
 
03:32:09.550 --> 03:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate being able to become EFA
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
students whether they use it for private
 
03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%

both a student instructor at a
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
homeschool Learning Center and a
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
homeschooler who is bened from school
 
03:32:48.030 --> 03:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
school choice I am here today to ask you
 
03:32:51.229 --> 03:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
to please support HB 115 throughout my
 
03:32:52.990 --> 03:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
high school career I've explored almost
 
03:32:54.550 --> 03:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
every educational pathway from
 
03:32:56.469 --> 03:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
homeschool co-ops to commun Community
 
03:32:58.830 --> 03:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
College classes to even internships I
 
03:33:01.189 --> 03:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
have tried it all I am truly fortunate
 
03:33:02.510 --> 03:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to my choices for
 
03:33:02.520 --> 03:33:04.070 align:start position:0%
when it comes to my choices for
educational

03:33:04.070 --> 03:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
educational
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities unfortunately not everyone
 
03:33:08.469 --> 03:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
else is as fortunate as I am when it
 
03:33:11.469 --> 03:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
comes to educational options we made
 
03:33:13.469 --> 03:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
great strides in financially assisting
 
03:33:15.309 --> 03:33:15.319 align:start position:0%
lower class families and the request for
 
03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
education Choice via the introduction of
 
03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
Education Freedom accounts however a
 
03:33:21.550 --> 03:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
certain group remains neglected the
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
middle class the current income
 
03:33:25.670 --> 03:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
threshold for efas does not account for
 
03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
the financial situations of individual
 
03:33:29.710 --> 03:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
families and despite falling above the
 
03:33:32.309 --> 03:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
350% income threshold there are still a
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
good number of families who struggle to
 
03:33:36.189 --> 03:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
afford school choice several of these
 
03:33:37.750 --> 03:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
families send their students to the hes
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
School Co-op I work at I've heard
 
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
firsthand how hard it can be to afford
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
their chosen education that doesn't mean
 
03:33:44.750 --> 03:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
that these families don't deserve the
 
03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
same choices that the of us have
 
03:33:49.469 --> 03:33:49.479 align:start position:0%
universalizing efas would equalize the
 
03:33:51.990 --> 03:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
playing field for these families I'm
 
03:33:53.870 --> 03:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
aware that there are several me members
 
03:33:55.630 --> 03:33:55.640 align:start position:0%
of The Homeschool Community who oppose
 
03:33:58.590 --> 03:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
both this bill and efas in general most
 
03:34:00.910 --> 03:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
of these individuals are elitists who SE
 
03:34:03.229 --> 03:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
selfishly wish to gatekeep school choice
 
03:34:05.150 --> 03:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
so that it is only an option for wealthy
 
03:34:07.269 --> 03:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
families these individuals have no
 
03:34:08.510 --> 03:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
business thinking that their school

I'm an I'm asking because you you're
 
03:34:37.590 --> 03:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
obviously a product of your choices that
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
you made this was your education and you
 
03:34:42.070 --> 03:34:42.080 align:start position:0%

that's all thank you very much further
 
03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for coming today

thank you Mr chairman you're welcome
 
03:34:59.710 --> 03:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:02.790 --> 03:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
May you've been a frequent flyer here in
 
03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
past years how's wear doing I'm pretty
 
03:35:07.830 --> 03:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
good Mr chairman thank you I'm David
 
03:35:10.229 --> 03:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
Trumble from the town awar and I oppose
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
this bill for two reasons first is the
 
03:35:13.469 --> 03:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
impact it would have on our
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional duty to fund Public
 
03:35:18.229 --> 03:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
School schools the Constitution requires
 
03:35:20.429 --> 03:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
that the state not the towns fund the
 
03:35:21.950 --> 03:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
public schools and the Claremont
 
03:35:23.950 --> 03:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
decision was very clear there's no
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
requirement to fund the private schools
 
03:35:28.229 --> 03:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court has upheld that
 
03:35:30.269 --> 03:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
same logic in the case that was I
 
03:35:32.110 --> 03:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
believe not quite accurately quoted
 
03:35:34.910 --> 03:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
earlier it was the Carson versus Mon
 
03:35:37.710 --> 03:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
case chief judge Robert said as we held
 
03:35:41.429 --> 03:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
in espanosa a state need not subsidize
 
03:35:43.870 --> 03:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
public education you have to fund the
 
03:35:45.870 --> 03:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
public schools and you have to do it
 
03:35:49.030 --> 03:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
fully you do not have to spend a dime on
 
03:35:51.309 --> 03:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
private schools once you fund the public
 
03:35:53.710 --> 03:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
schools and do your job then go ahead
 
03:35:56.590 --> 03:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
and do a voucher program second issue is
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
the issue of choice this is universal
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
vouchers but it's not Universal Choice
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
let's look at some of the people who
 
03:36:06.150 --> 03:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
would be left out first is special
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
education students over 20% of public
 
03:36:12.030 --> 03:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
school students receive special ed only
 
03:36:14.349 --> 03:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
6% in the voucher program and they have
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
to sign away their rights under the
 
03:36:20.110 --> 03:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
idea look at elll students there's 5,000
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that's 3% of our
 
03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
students under the last report there is
 
03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
zero in the voucher program look at
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
children living in poverty that's 7% of
 
03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
the children in the state the average
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
cost of a private school in New
 
03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is $221,600 they can't afford
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
to pay that there may be some lowcost
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
private schools some places with
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
scholarships but largely people who are
 
03:36:45.710 --> 03:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
poor cannot participate lgbtq students
 
03:36:48.429 --> 03:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
make up 22% of high school students not
 
03:36:50.309 --> 03:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
all but there are some private schools
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
who ban lgbtq students from attending
 
03:36:57.070 --> 03:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
lgbtq parents 5% of our adult population
 
03:36:59.469 --> 03:36:59.479 align:start position:0%
identify as lgbtq but if you have two
 
03:37:01.710 --> 03:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
moms or two dads many of the voucher
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
schools won't let you attend there's
 
03:37:05.630 --> 03:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
nothing Universal about Universal
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
vouchers the only Universal option you
 
03:37:09.710 --> 03:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
have is the public schools because they
 
03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
accept every single child and they give
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
every one of them a good education and
 
03:37:15.630 --> 03:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's why we have a constitutional Duty
 
03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
to fund them and there is no
 
03:37:19.389 --> 03:37:19.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional duty to fund the private
 
03:37:22.750 --> 03:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
schools thank you thank you very
 
03:37:22.760 --> 03:37:24.389 align:start position:0%
schools thank you thank you very
much

03:37:24.389 --> 03:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:37:29.429 --> 03:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.269 --> 03:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
sir thank you very much for taking my
 
03:37:34.590 --> 03:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
question if you believe that the state
 
03:37:36.349 --> 03:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
should be funding the schools and that
 
03:37:37.550 --> 03:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
it should not be something that the
 
03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers are paying do you also
 
03:37:41.469 --> 03:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
believe then that the state should be
 
03:37:43.189 --> 03:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
responsible for the budget in which
 
03:37:45.590 --> 03:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're funding
 
03:37:47.469 --> 03:37:47.479 align:start position:0%
you asking if the state should fund
 
03:37:49.469 --> 03:37:49.479 align:start position:0%
public school education I believe I just
 
03:37:50.670 --> 03:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
heard you say that it's our
 
03:37:52.269 --> 03:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional Duty that the state
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
should be funding Public Schools is that
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
correct what I heard yes representative
 
03:37:58.349 --> 03:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
so if the state should be funding them
 
03:38:00.150 --> 03:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
do you also agree that the state should
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
be responsible for all of the expenses
 
03:38:04.670 --> 03:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore be responsible for putting
 
03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
together the budget for the public
 
03:38:08.670 --> 03:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
schools as well those are two different
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
things the state has the duty to fund
 
03:38:13.229 --> 03:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
under the um Claremont decision it said
 
03:38:14.750 --> 03:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
that the state must guarantee the
 
03:38:17.309 --> 03:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
funding but the actual running of the
 
03:38:19.110 --> 03:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
schools is not required under the
 
03:38:20.750 --> 03:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
Clarmont decision that's left to the
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
local school
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
boards thank you yes represent luno
 
03:38:28.389 --> 03:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and and
 
03:38:31.070 --> 03:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Trumble so when
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
it when it comes to the state's funding
 
03:38:37.150 --> 03:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
of public schools are you aware that um
 
03:38:39.550 --> 03:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
that based on the department of Ed the
 
03:38:41.429 --> 03:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Ed data that
 
03:38:43.469 --> 03:38:43.479 align:start position:0%
this committee received earlier this
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
week that um that wear is ejected to
 
03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:48.070 align:start position:0%
week that um that wear is ejected to
receive

03:38:48.070 --> 03:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
receive
 
03:38:50.510 --> 03:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
$664,000 less next year from the state
 
03:38:52.269 --> 03:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
than it receives today thank you
 
03:38:54.030 --> 03:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative luno last night we had
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
our local Schoolboard meeting in advance
 
03:38:58.030 --> 03:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
of our deliberative session and that
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
came out that we are losing 600,000 but
 
03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
under the uh Readjustment of the
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid we're getting some of that
 
03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
back so we're really losing 460,000 net
 
03:39:11.630 --> 03:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
that's 35 cents per
 
03:39:14.150 --> 03:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
thousand on every home in our state so
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's like 100 and our town like
 
03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
$160 that's the first of five
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
installments that we're going to lose
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
under the hold harmless plan so we had
 
03:39:25.469 --> 03:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
the stabilization Grant to help towns
 
03:39:27.710 --> 03:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
like mine that don't have an adequate
 
03:39:30.750 --> 03:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
property tax base this coming two-year
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
cycle we lose 20% of the stabilization
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
Grant so my town is going to lose
 
03:39:37.590 --> 03:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
460,000 the two years after that we'll
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
lose another 460 then another 460
 
03:39:43.070 --> 03:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
another 460 another 460 the average
 
03:39:44.590 --> 03:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in my Town's going to end up
 
03:39:45.870 --> 03:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
paying like ,000
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
more just because we cut the
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund so pull that back to
 
03:39:51.229 --> 03:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
the voucher program where do we fund
 
03:39:52.710 --> 03:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
public schools from in the state the
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
education trust fund where are we
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
funding the voucher program from the
 
03:39:58.349 --> 03:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund if you expand this
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
program and reaching higher says it's
 
03:40:02.229 --> 03:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
going to cost $100 million that's going
 
03:40:03.670 --> 03:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
to mean a 100 million less than the
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that's going to
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
suck that fund dry and there won't be
 
03:40:09.269 --> 03:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
enough money for the public schools so
 
03:40:11.469 --> 03:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
there is a direct relationship I'm not
 
03:40:13.150 --> 03:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to every kid getting what they
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
want I think it's that that's how we
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
should should make it work but our first
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
obligation is to fund the public schools
 
03:40:20.469 --> 03:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
and last thing is when they set up the
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund 25 years ago it was
 
03:40:24.790 --> 03:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
in response to the kount decision there
 
03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
were Democrats and Republicans together
 
03:40:28.710 --> 03:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
who set that fund up so that we funded
 
03:40:31.349 --> 03:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
the public schools not to fund private
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
schools but that's where we now take the
 
03:40:34.590 --> 03:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
money for the voucher program out so
 
03:40:36.349 --> 03:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
there's a direct connection between the
 
03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
public school funding and the voucher
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:44.389 --> 03:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
welcome do you have will you take
 
03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
further questions course mire you have
 
03:40:47.840 --> 03:40:51.910 align:start position:0%
further questions course mire you have
no

03:40:51.910 --> 03:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
question yeah or name oh no question I
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
apologize okay thanks okay uh Sandra May
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
is here right
 
03:41:05.790 --> 03:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
here well that was a tough act to follow
 
03:41:07.550 --> 03:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon members of the House
 
03:41:09.469 --> 03:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Sandra May and
 
03:41:12.429 --> 03:41:12.439 align:start position:0%
I'm from Haner to talk to you today I'm
 
03:41:14.429 --> 03:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
taking a break from mudding drywall in
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
the new apartment that my husband and I
 
03:41:18.389 --> 03:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
have built while I'm proud to do
 
03:41:19.990 --> 03:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
something small to fight the housing
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
crisis in the state my main reason for
 
03:41:24.429 --> 03:41:24.439 align:start position:0%
building an Adu is that without a unit
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
we can rent out I don't see how we can
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
keep paying our property tax when we
 
03:41:31.389 --> 03:41:31.399 align:start position:0%
retire that said I'm hopeful this
 
03:41:33.070 --> 03:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
apartment will help one more family
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
either stay in New Hampshire or entice
 
03:41:38.149 --> 03:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
some badly needed workers here our
 
03:41:40.149 --> 03:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
educated Workforce has been a big New
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire strength hearing that we're
 
03:41:44.830 --> 03:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
facing budget cuts this year I don't
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
understand why why we're blowing up the
 
03:41:49.030 --> 03:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
budget by opening up these vouchers to
 
03:41:52.030 --> 03:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
everyone regardless of need what is this
 
03:41:53.950 --> 03:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
diversion of public funds going to do to
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools especially when some
 
03:41:58.510 --> 03:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
districts have lacked Equitable funding
 
03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
for decades what message are we sending
 
03:42:03.670 --> 03:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
to the young people we want to stay here
 
03:42:06.910 --> 03:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
or come here a $4,000 voucher is not
 
03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to go very far at St Paul's but
 
03:42:11.389 --> 03:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars diverting funds
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
from schools is ultimately going to make
 
03:42:16.269 --> 03:42:16.279 align:start position:0%
property taxes increasing even more
 
03:42:18.269 --> 03:42:18.279 align:start position:0%
while home ownership grows further Out
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
Of Reach if people want their child to
 
03:42:22.710 --> 03:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
have good education they'll either have
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
to stretch to find the rest of the money
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
for private school or someone in the
 
03:42:29.149 --> 03:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
household is going to have to step back
 
03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
on their career to home school this
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like a great way to entice
 
03:42:37.550 --> 03:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
Working Families to live here at all I
 
03:42:39.309 --> 03:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
understand that several of the previous
 
03:42:41.670 --> 03:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
speakers have made that exact difficult
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
Choice excellent Public Schools should
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
still be a viable option and I'd like to
 
03:42:50.149 --> 03:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
reiterate what Louise Spencer said
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
earlier you're not hearing from these
 
03:42:54.910 --> 03:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
Working Families they are they're at
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
work right now I don't mind paying taxes
 
03:43:03.149 --> 03:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
not to fund policing or public parks or
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
the education of more electricians for
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire having just built a
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
housing using unit of trust me we need
 
03:43:13.149 --> 03:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
more trades people in this space I in
 
03:43:15.309 --> 03:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
closing is this really the New Hampshire
 
03:43:17.429 --> 03:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
Advantage we're just going to keep
 
03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
ignoring the courts and give up on
 
03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
Equitable funding for strong Public
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
Schools I thank the committee for their
 
03:43:26.670 --> 03:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
time thank you very
 
03:43:39.870 --> 03:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
Grio thank you chairman lad and the
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
members of the education funding
 
03:43:46.149 --> 03:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:43:48.229 --> 03:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
Matthew greo I'm a college student
 
03:43:50.469 --> 03:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
currently at St an college and I'm from
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
lville New Hampshire and I've been
 
03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
through the public education system the
 
03:43:57.070 --> 03:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts represent a
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
critical step towards true educational
 
03:44:01.950 --> 03:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
freedom and by limiting the household
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
income requirement this bill helps get
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one step closer to a
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
stronger Freer education system by
 
03:44:10.990 --> 03:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
giving parents the ability to direct
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
their own education funds that they pay
 
03:44:15.389 --> 03:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
through taxes towards the the learn
 
03:44:17.590 --> 03:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
environment that best suits their
 
03:44:19.910 --> 03:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
child's unique needs we are finally
 
03:44:22.389 --> 03:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
freeing the public education system from
 
03:44:24.870 --> 03:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
the the Monopoly it holds over most
 
03:44:27.189 --> 03:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
families that has led to Statewide
 
03:44:27.199 --> 03:44:28.309 align:start position:0%

educational
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
decline historically the ability for
 
03:44:33.070 --> 03:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
parents to choose the best education for
 
03:44:35.149 --> 03:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
their children has been largely confined
 
03:44:37.870 --> 03:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
to the independently wealthy who could
 
03:44:40.030 --> 03:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
with ease afford private schools or
 
03:44:43.110 --> 03:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
alternative options this bill ends the E
 
03:44:45.670 --> 03:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
economic barrier returns the power of
 
03:44:47.950 --> 03:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
school choice to All Families regardless

status furthermore efas serve as a
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
powerful Catalyst for improvement within
 
03:44:58.269 --> 03:44:58.279 align:start position:0%
our public education system by expanding
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%

option to choose alternative education
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
paths Public Schools face a healthy
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
competition they are incentivized to
 
03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
Prior prioritize quality and efficiency

Northfield mayor M County District 25 uh
 
03:46:15.149 --> 03:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm also a product of a public
 
03:46:17.630 --> 03:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
school and a student at St Anam College
 
03:46:20.790 --> 03:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here to advocate in favor of HB 1115
 
03:46:22.630 --> 03:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
because education freedom is a right
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
that um of every student and should be
 
03:46:26.670 --> 03:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
access as accessible as possible to
 
03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
every student I grew up with two special
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
needs sisters one older one younger and
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
public school failed them they were told
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
by public school that they were
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
incapable of learning and that be they'd
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
be unable to graduate from high school
 
03:46:41.950 --> 03:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
so we moved on to a charter school and
 
03:46:43.309 --> 03:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
the charter school really helped my
 
03:46:44.950 --> 03:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
older sister who ended up graduating
 
03:46:46.750 --> 03:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
High School when the public school said
 
03:46:46.760 --> 03:46:47.750 align:start position:0%
High School when the public school said
she

03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
she
 
03:46:50.910 --> 03:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't unfortunately the charter
 
03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
school was not helping my younger sister
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
who is now in homeschooling and working
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
with an independent special needs um
 
03:47:01.030 --> 03:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
teacher to be able to um best suit her
 
03:47:02.830 --> 03:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
needs and now she's succeeding where the
 
03:47:04.349 --> 03:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
Char even the charter school thought she
 
03:47:06.510 --> 03:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
would fail um they thought she wouldn't
 
03:47:08.670 --> 03:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
be able to do algebra well right now
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
she's in pre-algebra but she's working
 
03:47:12.269 --> 03:47:12.279 align:start position:0%
her way up to algebra in ways that the
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
charter school wasn't able to get her to
 
03:47:16.590 --> 03:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
and the only reason we could afford that
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
um private instructor was because of
 
03:47:21.910 --> 03:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
efas um education Freedom allows more
 
03:47:23.710 --> 03:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
students to be engaged with the subjects
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
that they care about in more Hands-On or
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
intimate settings as needed um just like
 
03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
my sister who has been able to learn
 
03:47:32.149 --> 03:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
better from them um and they're not
 
03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
constrained to a one-sized fits-all
 
03:47:36.070 --> 03:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
public school classroom efas are also
 
03:47:37.790 --> 03:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
more cost- effective to the taxpayer
 
03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
while offering more opportunities for
 
03:47:41.469 --> 03:47:41.479 align:start position:0%
these students um and especially with
 
03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
struggling public schools in Lower Class
 
03:47:46.510 --> 03:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
areas including the SA in my district um
 
03:47:49.189 --> 03:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
which have declining enrollment rates um
 
03:47:51.070 --> 03:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
having more resources available to all
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
parents is critical so for these reasons
 
03:47:55.469 --> 03:47:55.479 align:start position:0%
and to fund students not systems I
 
03:47:58.269 --> 03:47:58.279 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to find hb15 on
 
03:48:00.030 --> 03:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
to pass thank you and I will not yield
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
to questions thank you very
 
03:48:10.870 --> 03:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:16.349 --> 03:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:18.429 --> 03:48:18.439 align:start position:0%
and in the hallway we must have a child
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
out there uh a mom with kids yes you'll
 
03:48:23.040 --> 03:48:31.590 align:start position:0%
out there uh a mom with kids yes you'll

03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
next me me me me me is that better okay
 
03:48:36.550 --> 03:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
um my name is Bonnie Brun I'm a Hollis
 
03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
resident I do appreciate being able to
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
speak today in a public forum most of
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
this may have been said but the fact
 
03:48:44.870 --> 03:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
that my pocking ticket probably has
 
03:48:46.189 --> 03:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
pocking ticket I'm going to go ahead and
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
take the
 
03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
time um so I stand in opposition of the
 
03:48:51.910 --> 03:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts and the
 
03:48:54.630 --> 03:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
expansion of the same as a taxpayer I do
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
not want to subsidize private private
 
03:48:59.149 --> 03:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
religious or homeschooling options I
 
03:49:01.389 --> 03:49:01.399 align:start position:0%
want to fund the public school and the
 
03:49:03.149 --> 03:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth as somebody already said I
 
03:49:05.469 --> 03:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
don't mind paying taxes I believe in the
 
03:49:07.510 --> 03:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth um I'd like to have the
 
03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
money that is um being used about 10% to
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
facilitate the program at the New
 
03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children's scholarship fund to
 
03:49:16.149 --> 03:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
actually be in the school system and
 
03:49:18.910 --> 03:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
funding the actual school system um
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
private and religious and homeschooling
 
03:49:22.229 --> 03:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
institutions are not accountable to the
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
public have no public oversight or input
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
and do not have to be transparent in
 
03:49:27.710 --> 03:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
their policies and procedures to the
 
03:49:30.189 --> 03:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
public for example private and religious
 
03:49:31.830 --> 03:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
and even homeschooling
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
programs um can use uh
 
03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
discriminating wrong dword can use
 
03:49:40.269 --> 03:49:40.279 align:start position:0%
Discerning in their enrollment process
 
03:49:43.070 --> 03:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
making decisions and exclude students
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
was much more eloquently described just
 
03:49:47.389 --> 03:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago um exclude students
 
03:49:49.030 --> 03:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
and it's not inclusive whereas public
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
schools are inclusive um I have so many
 
03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
notes on here from sitting there taking
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
notes that it's like good luck to me
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
trying to follow this but you know my
 
03:49:59.790 --> 03:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
nephew was in um two different religious
 
03:50:01.950 --> 03:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
private schools and was severely bullied
 
03:50:03.550 --> 03:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
and so had to be pulled out of them so
 
03:50:05.429 --> 03:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
you know Bullying happens not a good
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
thing um my friend is a single parent
 
03:50:11.590 --> 03:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
who had a hot economic challenges in the
 
03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
um lfi Public Schools educated her son
 
03:50:16.670 --> 03:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
so he became uh went on to become a
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
brown graduate and that was thanks to
 
03:50:22.189 --> 03:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Public Schools well um
 
03:50:24.189 --> 03:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
while some may say that they too pay
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
taxes and they want their tax dollars to
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
fund their school choice I say I their
 
03:50:32.229 --> 03:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
choice I say I hear you except I would
 
03:50:34.349 --> 03:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
like to allocate my tax dollars as well
 
03:50:36.189 --> 03:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
but we don't have that system which we
 
03:50:37.990 --> 03:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
can earm Mar and allocate our tax
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
dollars because if we did I would not
 
03:50:43.750 --> 03:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
elect to fund the EFA accounts um I said
 
03:50:45.630 --> 03:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
one quote I want to read read which is
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
you know this seems to be a nationwide
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
and certainly happening in New Hampshire
 
03:50:52.590 --> 03:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
that from the pruer article I read that
 
03:50:54.269 --> 03:50:54.279 align:start position:0%
starting with targeted programs that
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
place needy kids in parochial schools
 
03:50:58.590 --> 03:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
then fight to expand the benefits to
 
03:51:00.910 --> 03:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
far- richer families is an effort by a
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
network of politicians Church officials
 
03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
and activists all United by a conviction
 
03:51:07.710 --> 03:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
that there is separation of church and
 
03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
state is a legitimate I believe that the
 
03:51:11.149 --> 03:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
separation of church and state is
 
03:51:13.030 --> 03:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
legitimate as pointed out earlier by
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative Damon and and
 
03:51:18.510 --> 03:51:18.520 align:start position:0%

03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%

and I live in Danville New Hampshire um
 
03:51:54.030 --> 03:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
there is an issue with our public
 
03:51:56.710 --> 03:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
schools in our country and I find it
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
really amazing that people from school
 
03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
boards and budget committees are coming
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
in here and saying that efas are the
 
03:52:06.030 --> 03:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
problem they talk about being F fiscally
 
03:52:07.790 --> 03:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
responsible I think that they need to
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
look in the mirror and realize that
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
there is a supply and demand issue
 
03:52:14.950 --> 03:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment is down yet taxes go up and
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
parents want a choice we are EFA
 
03:52:19.030 --> 03:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
students and I can tell you that our
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
public school district has been
 
03:52:22.429 --> 03:52:22.439 align:start position:0%
mismanaging funds for over the last 5
 
03:52:25.750 --> 03:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
years the budget went up 15% and they
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
had a $16 million surplus and put in
 
03:52:30.670 --> 03:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
tennis lights and an irrigation pond
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
with a boat for
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
decoration why are we not holding these
 
03:52:36.590 --> 03:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
budget committees and school boards
 
03:52:38.750 --> 03:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
responsible we are spending all this
 
03:52:40.710 --> 03:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
money and the kids are not passing their
 
03:52:43.389 --> 03:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
tests if they can't do basic budgeting
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
and math how can I trust them to educate
 
03:52:48.670 --> 03:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
my child I spend a small percentage of
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
what is spent on public school students
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%

Hampshire um so I just want to get this
 
03:53:56.990 --> 03:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
straight when a business offers a
 
03:54:00.070 --> 03:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
failing product they go under but when a
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
public school offers a failing product
 
03:54:03.750 --> 03:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
we get upset that they're losing a
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
fraction of their
 
03:54:07.950 --> 03:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
budget uh the cat is out of the bag
 
03:54:09.870 --> 03:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
especially since covid I'd like to say
 
03:54:14.510 --> 03:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
in 2020 we saw 2020 and a lot of parents
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
have decided not to go back to the
 
03:54:18.750 --> 03:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
school so we can have disagreements over
 
03:54:20.950 --> 03:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
empirical data but the perception of the
 
03:54:23.110 --> 03:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
public is that the schools are feeling
 
03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.080 align:start position:0%

a catch-all phrase to a lot of these
 
03:56:50.349 --> 03:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
Alternatives um so you might see

not have achieved this without the
 
03:59:17.149 --> 03:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
foundational support and principles of
 
03:59:19.950 --> 03:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
our educational system New Hampshire

National Center for Education
 
03:59:32.750 --> 03:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
statistics hb15 is a bad faith bill it
 
03:59:34.710 --> 03:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
erodes resources and Trust in
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
established and accredited institutions
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
it will contribute to increased taxes
 
03:59:40.630 --> 03:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
for all residents whether they use efas
 
03:59:43.389 --> 03:59:43.399 align:start position:0%
or not it will expand the impact and
 
03:59:44.670 --> 03:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
need of the teacher teacher shortage and
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
impact teacher salaries and retirement
 
03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
it will expand the risk of fraudulent
 
03:59:52.469 --> 03:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
schools and underage kids and lastly it
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
will undermine the quality of public
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%

04:02:00.030 --> 04:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
okay then it be Jody
 
04:02:03.229 --> 04:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
Underwood following thank you Mr chair
 
04:02:07.309 --> 04:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
I'm y po representing May Mark hook
 
04:02:09.670 --> 04:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
Buton and I'm here in support of this
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh some argue against this bill uh
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
saying that money will go to rich people
 
04:02:20.110 --> 04:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh but it is exactly why we need to
 
04:02:24.630 --> 04:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
support this uh Bill uh so rich parents
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
would contribute more what I see in my
 
04:02:30.950 --> 04:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
district uh uh when uh parents picking
 
04:02:34.389 --> 04:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
up kids from public schools uh sometimes
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh I I see some come and luxury Cs
 
04:02:41.070 --> 04:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
and luxury German cars over all
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
expensive uh trucks if uh rich people
 
04:02:46.950 --> 04:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
would contribute more we would create
 
04:02:50.590 --> 04:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
more competition and Excellence um it
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
used to be illegal for rich people to
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
get free public school benefit no longer
 
04:03:00.309 --> 04:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
so we cannot force them out but this
 
04:03:03.790 --> 04:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
bill will create Financial incentive for
 
04:03:07.229 --> 04:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
them to contribute more and stop using
 
04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh free public school benefit that is
 
04:03:12.910 --> 04:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
free but is very expensive for taxpayers
 
04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative yeah
 
04:03:20.750 --> 04:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understood that part you
 
04:03:25.710 --> 04:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
were saying you want rich people to use
 
04:03:30.309 --> 04:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts and not
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
go to public
 
04:03:35.590 --> 04:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
schools uh yeah yeah yes uh in my
 
04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
district uh um uh in my town we have
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
like growing School population so uh
 
04:03:46.349 --> 04:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will have to uh pay more taxes
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
to expand facilities like some um fixed
 
04:03:54.189 --> 04:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
income people are getting uh priced out
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
of their homes through bigger taxes and
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
when Public School spends no of
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
$23,000 per people if some of those rich
 
04:04:10.590 --> 04:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
people will get U uh uh $4,000 from
 
04:04:14.110 --> 04:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
State and uh stop getting this free
 
04:04:16.870 --> 04:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
public school benefit uh previously you
 
04:04:20.349 --> 04:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
heard that it it's on average
 
04:04:24.429 --> 04:04:24.439 align:start position:0%
$21,000 uh for private school tuition so
 
04:04:26.670 --> 04:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
they obviously would need to contribute
 
04:04:30.830 --> 04:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
more but I think it's win-win
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
situation thank you further questions
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
Underwood she's gone too
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%

04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%

me everything else looks really good I
 
04:05:02.229 --> 04:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
salmon welcome this late hour thank you
 
04:05:09.149 --> 04:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
I was beginning to think my card was
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
lost um so my name is Amanda Weeden I'm
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
a little too close um I'm a home
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
education Advocate and I'm a republican
 
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
voter um so I'm an anomaly here because
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
um I believe hb15 is a fiscally
 
04:05:22.199 --> 04:05:24.389 align:start position:0%
um I believe hb15 is a fiscally
irresponsible

04:05:24.389 --> 04:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
irresponsible
 
04:05:27.510 --> 04:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
Bill the available finances and data and
 
04:05:29.950 --> 04:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
lack of data for the current EFA program
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
point to additional tax obligations and
 
04:05:34.110 --> 04:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
accountability issues if this bill
 
04:05:37.070 --> 04:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
passes we've heard multiple moral
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.189 --> 04:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
hearing the there's not been one
 
04:05:49.269 --> 04:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
accurate fiscal argument in support of
 
04:05:51.990 --> 04:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
this bill according to program data over
 
04:05:54.870 --> 04:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
70% of participants were already paying
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
for their own
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
choices my children all four of them
 
04:06:02.510 --> 04:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
qualify for the EFA program I am a
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
lowincome family we qualify for the full
 
04:06:08.349 --> 04:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
amount and as a home educator in New
 
04:06:12.070 --> 04:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I refuse I reject education
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts because its taxpayer
 
04:06:14.640 --> 04:06:16.670 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts because its taxpayer
funded

04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
funded
 
04:06:20.149 --> 04:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
money the majority of students were not
 
04:06:22.750 --> 04:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
switchers these are not kids coming out
 
04:06:26.349 --> 04:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
of public schools as was pitched at the
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of this program they are not
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
switchers so they were not enrolled
 
04:06:33.389 --> 04:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
they're not included in enrollment
 
04:06:35.790 --> 04:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
numbers I've heard multiple times
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
Republicans say that this is a savings
 
04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers but that's fuzzy
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
math these kids didn't cost 20 grand of
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money this EFA money of five
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
grand is an additional tax obligation
 
04:06:53.189 --> 04:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
those kids were never included in the
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
funding guys this bill would allow
 
04:06:58.269 --> 04:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
wealthy families who already pay private
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
school tuition tax pay your money for
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
their choice and this is
 
04:07:06.110 --> 04:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
outrageous the young lady earlier who
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
referred to people like me as elitist
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
because we refuse this we reject this
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
I'm a Conservative Republican voter
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
consistently and this is an
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
outrageous outrageous
 
04:07:24.030 --> 04:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
bill I pay for my own choice to home
 
04:07:27.070 --> 04:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
educate my children and I should not
 
04:07:30.630 --> 04:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
expect nor should anyone expect that my
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
elderly neighbor or the empty nesters
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
should pay for pottery wheels and dance
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
lessons for other people in this state
 
04:07:41.590 --> 04:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
so I didn't get to all my things but I
 
04:07:42.830 --> 04:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
just want to say there's too many
 
04:07:45.550 --> 04:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions right now about
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
this current EFA program it would be
 
04:07:50.910 --> 04:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
irresponsible to expand it and moral
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
arguments don't pay the
 
04:07:57.670 --> 04:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
bills thank you any questions from the
 
04:08:01.750 --> 04:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee yes profor McGuire thank you
 
04:08:05.389 --> 04:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
so the reason you homeschool I guess is
 
04:08:08.670 --> 04:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
what I heard um is because you think the
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
the results will be better than if you
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
your children went to public school
 
04:08:16.269 --> 04:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
I would like to Define terms sir I'm a
 
04:08:18.309 --> 04:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
home educator not a homeschooler there
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
are four distinct educational Pathways
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I am third pathway we
 
04:08:26.109 --> 04:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
have very specific rights under the law
 
04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
and I maintain that I follow the law and
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
rights and I do what is best for my
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
children without taxpayer funded
 
04:08:37.109 --> 04:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
money yeah may I follow up yes you may
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so can you can you distinguish
 
04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
between homeschool and home educate or
 
04:08:47.710 --> 04:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
would representative I would love
 
04:08:51.109 --> 04:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
to homeschooling has become a generic
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
term okay so everybody's homeschooling
 
04:08:57.630 --> 04:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
and that could mean that could include
 
04:09:00.109 --> 04:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
an EFA which is a fourth educational
 
04:09:02.750 --> 04:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
pathway family that uses this taxpayer
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
money for home education related
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
expenses so it looks like home education
 
04:09:10.109 --> 04:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
right same day-to-day experience except
 
04:09:12.510 --> 04:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
they're using taxpayer money to pay for
 
04:09:15.070 --> 04:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
their things I am not I'm scrimping and
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
saving as a low-income person with four
 
04:09:20.349 --> 04:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
children a special needs child that I
 
04:09:22.630 --> 04:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
pay for everything myself as a
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
Conservative Republican it is my
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
position that people need to pay for
 
04:09:27.309 --> 04:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
stuff so homeschooling is a generic term
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
but that is not the same as the third
 
04:09:36.389 --> 04:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
educational pathway in New Hampshire
 
04:09:38.750 --> 04:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
that is homeeducation designated under
 
04:09:38.760 --> 04:09:40.389 align:start position:0%
that is homeeducation designated under
RSA

04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
193a so homeschooling generic fa could
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
be included in that right but home
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
education is very very specific under
 
04:09:52.349 --> 04:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
the law so our rights equal access law
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
our requirements everything is very
 
04:09:56.990 --> 04:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
plainly written in
 
04:10:00.349 --> 04:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
law that's what I like I want to be left
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
alone I want to be left out of it I'm
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
very Freedom minded I'm a liberty person
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm grieved that I'm a Conservative
 
04:10:10.349 --> 04:10:10.359 align:start position:0%
Republican here opposing this bill
 
04:10:12.990 --> 04:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
publicly thank you very much all right
 
04:10:13.000 --> 04:10:13.870 align:start position:0%
publicly thank you very much all right
well

04:10:13.870 --> 04:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:10:15.630 --> 04:10:15.640 align:start position:0%

because we this is not relative to the
 
04:11:14.189 --> 04:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
hb15 yes there that's a very very active

with them so but that we're just getting
 
04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
way off the path here with respect Mr
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%

much my name is Laura Vincent and I live
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
in lden New
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is very important that
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
hb15 be soundly defeated the best
 
04:12:25.469 --> 04:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the children of New
 
04:12:27.109 --> 04:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have their educational
 
04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
needs met and their educational
 
04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities expanded is with New
 
04:12:35.109 --> 04:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Schools the funds each
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
student receives through their EA around
 
04:12:41.790 --> 04:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
$5,000 is not enough to pend private or
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
parochial school truition
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
this makes the EFA program useless for
 
04:12:49.870 --> 04:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
families of limited incomes as Studies
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
have shown efas are utilized mostly by
 
04:12:55.870 --> 04:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
families whose children already attend
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
nine Public
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
Schools when discussing special
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
education it is important that everyone
 
04:13:04.750 --> 04:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
realizes the breadth of the spectrum of
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
needs being
 
04:13:08.750 --> 04:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
discussed we may be talking about
 
04:13:10.910 --> 04:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
children who need occasional one one of
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
small group tutoring to master difficult
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
Concepts or perhaps students with mared
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
hearing losss who may need preference or
 
04:13:21.630 --> 04:13:21.640 align:start position:0%
seaing and the opportunity to frequently
 
04:13:24.349 --> 04:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
have teacher instructions repeated I'm
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
sure that many private and parochial
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
schools can accommodate CH students with
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
these minimal types of special needs
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
however special education Also Serve
 
04:13:36.870 --> 04:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
children with complex special needs
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
affecting their total educational
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
experiences so some students may need
 
04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
one in one a
 
04:13:45.349 --> 04:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
serving them all day to assist with
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
their physical needs or they may need to
 
04:13:50.830 --> 04:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
utilize modified instructional materials
 
04:13:53.309 --> 04:13:53.319 align:start position:0%
some students may need speech therapy
 
04:13:56.349 --> 04:13:56.359 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy and or physical
 
04:13:58.189 --> 04:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
therapy frequently to address the
 
04:14:01.309 --> 04:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
developmental needs some students such
 
04:14:03.790 --> 04:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
as those with severe visual or and or
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
hearing deficits need and deserve
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
instruction from teachers who are truly
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
proficient in skills such as reading bar
 
04:14:13.469 --> 04:14:13.479 align:start position:0%
and communicating with American sign
 
04:14:15.870 --> 04:14:15.880 align:start position:0%

04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
attend special schools access to their

Kathleen Slover and I'm from Portsmith a
 
04:15:15.109 --> 04:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
quick story about my son's experience in
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
public school my son struggled through
 
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
Elementary School with ADHD and
 
04:15:23.189 --> 04:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
non-verbal learning disability one of
 
04:15:26.429 --> 04:15:26.439 align:start position:0%
his IEP reports wrote social concerns
 
04:15:29.149 --> 04:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
are the biggest concern self-regulation
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
is a goal for him it is a concern that
 
04:15:34.109 --> 04:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
these things may impact his ability to
 
04:15:34.119 --> 04:15:34.910 align:start position:0%
these things may impact his ability to
be

04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:15:37.389 --> 04:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
successful after researching private
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
schools and homeschooling options I
 
04:15:41.630 --> 04:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
realized these Alternatives were ill
 
04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
equipped to deal with kids with learning
 
04:15:46.149 --> 04:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
difference differences in fact many of
 
04:15:48.429 --> 04:15:48.439 align:start position:0%
the private schools had a box that you
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
checked and they wouldn't accept you if
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
you got diagnosed with ADHD so we
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
decided to keep him in the public
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
schools fast forward to his sophomore
 
04:16:00.670 --> 04:16:00.680 align:start position:0%

he's a curious student who wants to do
 
04:16:13.309 --> 04:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
well in all his classes he is helpful
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%

achievements and looking back it was the
 
04:16:42.990 --> 04:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
best decision on behalf of the 90% of
 
04:16:45.030 --> 04:16:45.040 align:start position:0%

04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
private school correct um and I'm sorry
 
04:17:16.109 --> 04:17:16.119 align:start position:0%
I don't even know what it stands for
 
04:17:20.990 --> 04:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
individual um thank you um yeah he went
 
04:17:24.910 --> 04:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
through a process that is legal it's
 
04:17:27.870 --> 04:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
it's I got well versed in the legality
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
of it but first he had a 504 which is
 
04:17:34.590 --> 04:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
just offering um a an outline of what
 
04:17:37.630 --> 04:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
benefits he would things he would
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
benefit in the classroom and when those
 
04:17:43.349 --> 04:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
didn't 100% work um we got
 
04:17:45.070 --> 04:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh he got
 
04:17:47.950 --> 04:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
re-evaluated um and then the public
 
04:17:51.109 --> 04:17:51.119 align:start position:0%
school had to offer him Services all the
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
way through um sophomore year and it was
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of his sophomore year that we
 
04:17:59.109 --> 04:17:59.119 align:start position:0%

thank you were you involved in
 
04:18:18.030 --> 04:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
developing those IEPs yes we I met
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
monthly at the schools with the teachers
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to tell you it wasn't
 
04:18:22.479 --> 04:18:23.469 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to tell you it wasn't
always

04:18:23.469 --> 04:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
always
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
easy um but by the end of every school
 
04:18:30.189 --> 04:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
year we were making progress I think one
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
of the things that came out of all of
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
this was his um confidence and
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
personage was left intact he um the
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
public schools did not make him an a
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
student because he's not an a student
 
04:18:49.309 --> 04:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
but what they did do is make him a
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
resilient he has amazing amount of
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
stuven um his ability to manage his ADHD
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
because in the National Guard you have
 
04:19:01.830 --> 04:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
to admit that you have not you can't be
 
04:19:03.630 --> 04:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
treated for ADHD he does not take
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
medication for it and the public school
 
04:19:08.309 --> 04:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
worked with him and I was there the
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
entire time a lot of his teachers uh who
 
04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
came into the IEP meeting all the way
 
04:19:15.950 --> 04:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
through said hey you know what I have
 
04:19:20.070 --> 04:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
ADHD um so the Public Schools strike me
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
as the um you know what's the what's the
 
04:19:26.429 --> 04:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
quote on the uh Statute of Liberty they
 
04:19:30.590 --> 04:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
take everybody and what they produce is
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
solid members of the community um this
 
04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
is a kid that went through boot camp
 
04:19:38.149 --> 04:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
that goes to college he's doing it all

have been able to attend college enter
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
the workforce or pursue other goals with
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
the knowledge that we are backed by a
 
04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
wealth of quality teachings I'll admit
 
04:20:59.189 --> 04:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
sonop wasn't always perfect but a lot of
 
04:21:01.229 --> 04:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
the issues people raise as reasons to
 
04:21:02.750 --> 04:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
send their children to private schools
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
on vouchers won't be solved by just
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
sending these kids to a school that
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't report to the state when I
 
04:21:10.510 --> 04:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to change something in my school
 
04:21:12.030 --> 04:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
I applied to be a student body
 
04:21:12.040 --> 04:21:13.189 align:start position:0%
I applied to be a student body
representative

04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
when I held a seat on the student
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
council we held sway over school events
 
04:21:19.870 --> 04:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
and I was included on panels of students
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
that met to advise our principle on
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
rules and policy the thing to keep in
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
mind is that public schools can and do
 
04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
educate their attendees to a high
 
04:21:32.269 --> 04:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
standard and are good places for
 
04:21:35.229 --> 04:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
developing children to Bay the reason I
 
04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:37.760 align:start position:0%

of school committee and uh I'm here on
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of the committee um in most what
 
04:22:44.229 --> 04:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
I'll distinguish the piece that will
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
come from me but uh the the manest board
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
school committee does not support this
 
04:22:53.429 --> 04:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill and uh we've discussed it our
 
04:22:55.269 --> 04:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
education legislation chairman had to
 
04:22:57.109 --> 04:22:57.119 align:start position:0%
leave Dr par I think would have been
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
following me up but he has uh
 
04:23:02.189 --> 04:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
distributed paperwork just now that I'd
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
ask you to look at and he's also
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
extensively gone into articles and and
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
and studies that you could look at
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's um but I'm not going to you know
 
04:23:15.550 --> 04:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
not I'm not a fan of of voucher systems
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
to begin with and the EFA in particular
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
but I think we might those of you who
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
know me kind of know that so I I'm here
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
today because I think this should ought
 
04:23:25.990 --> 04:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be an easy decision with great
 
04:23:29.070 --> 04:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
respect to my friends who who uh you
 
04:23:31.389 --> 04:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
know uh would would would put first and
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
for foremost uh the fiscal rectitude and
 
04:23:37.630 --> 04:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility I I I Echo what I heard
 
04:23:39.269 --> 04:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
here earlier about the problems with the
 
04:23:42.750 --> 04:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
current bill already you know the the
 
04:23:46.990 --> 04:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
the the audit thing right 50 a random 50
 
04:23:48.830 --> 04:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh people receiving these accounts was
 
04:23:52.469 --> 04:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
was looked at and 25% of them had errors
 
04:23:55.229 --> 04:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
in them so we know that the other the
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
only other place that's published we
 
04:23:57.870 --> 04:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
look at the list of places that have
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
gotten the money 25% of the money is
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:24:04.349 --> 04:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
amazon.com this money has been spent for
 
04:24:07.469 --> 04:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
instance down at we don't know where a
 
04:24:09.309 --> 04:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
lot of it is but we know that it's been
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
used to go to a trip down to Mystic
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
conne to go to the aquarium I guess they
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
could afford the gas to go right past
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
the one in Boston because it was the
 
04:24:20.550 --> 04:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't good enough I I just don't
 
04:24:23.149 --> 04:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
understand when we're facing the kind of
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
problems that we're facing in this state
 
04:24:27.429 --> 04:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
financially of this Bia where we're
 
04:24:30.630 --> 04:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
finding the time in energy to remember
 
04:24:33.030 --> 04:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would only do this the only
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
people it's going to affect are people
 
04:24:36.990 --> 04:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
who are earning greater than the medium
 
04:24:38.910 --> 04:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
income median income in the state of New
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%

04:25:28.590 --> 04:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
year now when I it it hurts me and I I I
 
04:25:30.910 --> 04:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
I do empathize that parenting is I've
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
got four kids parenting is hard and when
 
04:25:34.950 --> 04:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
you have kids with extra challenges it's
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
extra hard and I know and I hear the
 
04:25:39.189 --> 04:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
pain I hear it all the time from parents
 
04:25:40.990 --> 04:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
but to say that public schools are not
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
making efforts in this regard we're
 
04:25:46.269 --> 04:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
spending $17 million a year in Services
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
Beyond that's not for all the employees
 
04:25:51.309 --> 04:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
we have that's for outside Services
 
04:25:54.149 --> 04:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
we're sending children all over to 28
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
different towns and cities to get them
 
04:25:58.030 --> 04:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
the services they need we have
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
individual students who've gotten close
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
to a million dollars worth of worth of
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
special education so it's an insult that
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of people who
 
04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
work on these children every day to help
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
them and to bring them forward so I
 
04:26:13.950 --> 04:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
would I would say one last thing if I
 
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
could Mr chairman I I think that if the
 
04:26:19.830 --> 04:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
problem with public education is really
 
04:26:21.950 --> 04:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
there and as extensive as some of our
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
citizens have said here today I think
 
04:26:26.750 --> 04:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
the the State Board of Education perhaps
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
the other one now should be the other
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
committee should be looking at that you
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
know if if our you know if our schools
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
are not doing what what we claim that
 
04:26:36.510 --> 04:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing so I would ask you to
 
04:26:39.030 --> 04:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
oppose it because it's a luxury at very
 
04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
best we can't afford and we need
 
04:26:40.920 --> 04:26:42.590 align:start position:0%
best we can't afford and we need
accountability

04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
going thank you you say Sean's not going
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be here too no Shawn had to leave he
 
04:26:49.950 --> 04:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
he to leave he did he did but I'd be
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
happy to accept any questions if anybody
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
has are there any
 
04:26:56.189 --> 04:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you all right thank you

04:26:58.399 --> 04:26:59.070 align:start position:0%
very much and much appreciate your work
thank

04:26:59.070 --> 04:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:26:59.080 --> 04:27:01.790 align:start position:0%
thank

you
 
04:27:22.630 --> 04:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:24.790 --> 04:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
good evening good evening thank you Mr
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh chair and the members of the
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is simita thur and
 
04:27:33.189 --> 04:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
I'm from exitor New Hampshire um when I
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
first saw uh this bill that it's uh the
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
universal education Freedom accounts I
 
04:27:40.309 --> 04:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
said wow excellent finally something
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
that can you know that everybody can
 
04:27:45.229 --> 04:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
really on but as soon as I looked at the
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
wording I realized that it's not
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
Universal at all and that it just
 
04:27:54.750 --> 04:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
benefits now if Bill 115 passes it will
 
04:27:57.950 --> 04:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
benefit now only the wealthiest or in
 
04:27:59.109 --> 04:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
addition to everybody else the
 
04:28:00.990 --> 04:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
wealthiest people from New Hampshire and
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
it will not uh improve the benefits for
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
the lowest income members of our
 
04:28:11.790 --> 04:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
community uh the voucher amounts simply
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
do not not cover enough uh to for
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
tuition and expenses in most uh private
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
schools and even
 
04:28:23.189 --> 04:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
if a family finds a private school that
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
could fit uh the amount that the budget
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
covers and it's across the state they
 
04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
have no way to get their child to that
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
school because vouchers do not cover
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation um
 
04:28:40.630 --> 04:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
expenses um and with uh Governor Kelly
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
aot um
 
04:28:46.990 --> 04:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
mentioning or U warning us that there
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
would be budget cuts um I'm wondering
 
04:28:53.070 --> 04:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
how the increase in the cost to the
 
04:28:56.030 --> 04:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
state will be covered uh because now
 
04:28:56.040 --> 04:28:57.269 align:start position:0%
state will be covered uh because now
with

04:28:57.269 --> 04:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
basically uh education Freedom accounts
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
being open to everyone um the cost is
 
04:29:06.910 --> 04:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
going to Skyrocket to over100 million
 
04:29:09.670 --> 04:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
and I see two ways of how those costs
 
04:29:12.670 --> 04:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
would be covered um both which are kind
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
of scary one is the increase in property
 
04:29:19.590 --> 04:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
taxes uh and the ironic thing about that
 
04:29:22.590 --> 04:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
is that he would be all of the members
 
04:29:24.309 --> 04:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
of our community including the lowest
 
04:29:27.510 --> 04:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
income ones who would be through their
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes paying for the vouchers
 
04:29:34.030 --> 04:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
that the most wealthy families will be
 
04:29:34.040 --> 04:29:36.189 align:start position:0%
that the most wealthy families will be
getting

04:29:36.189 --> 04:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
getting
 
04:29:39.670 --> 04:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
um and the other is by uh reducing the
 
04:29:42.109 --> 04:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
programs in schools and my children work
 
04:29:44.710 --> 04:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
hugely benefited from music from art
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
from World languages they were taught in
 
04:29:48.910 --> 04:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
their uh Cooperative Middle School in
 
04:29:51.630 --> 04:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
stratum New Hampshire thank you so I'm
 
04:29:55.030 --> 04:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
voting voting giving my opinion uh to
 
04:29:59.070 --> 04:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
oppose Bill uh 115 thank you very much
 
04:30:03.030 --> 04:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:08.830 --> 04:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.189 --> 04:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
C I don't know I I couldn't make up
 
04:30:35.189 --> 04:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:37.750 --> 04:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
a it looks like
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
Haley yes yeah it's Kaye Ned is
 
04:30:42.880 --> 04:30:47.910 align:start position:0%
Haley yes yeah it's Kaye Ned is
here

04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:05.070 --> 04:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:07.870 --> 04:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
done hello everyone I'm Su Hannan I'm
 
04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
from dairy and I come speaking for
 
04:31:13.870 --> 04:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
myself in opposition of hb15 I'm an
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
educator and I work in the public
 
04:31:17.030 --> 04:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
schools in
 
04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester as you're well aware those of
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
us working hard in public education do
 
04:31:25.070 --> 04:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
not take kindly to these voucher schemes
 
04:31:26.830 --> 04:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
that have infiltrated this and other
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
states as they siphon money away from
 
04:31:31.389 --> 04:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
the public school systems and have
 
04:31:32.670 --> 04:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
little to no
 
04:31:34.870 --> 04:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
accountability in this state we are
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
transparent about public school systems
 
04:31:43.469 --> 04:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
and the funding and uh holding public
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
meetings that account for every cent
 
04:31:48.630 --> 04:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
that we spend showing how much every
 
04:31:50.990 --> 04:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
person in the district makes and being
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible with taxpayer money
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
why then are we even thinking about
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
allowing cart blanch for private
 
04:32:00.750 --> 04:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
education and not asking for any
 
04:32:03.630 --> 04:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
accountability for where this money goes
 
04:32:05.910 --> 04:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
how does it happen in New Hampshire that
 
04:32:09.030 --> 04:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
a private entity gets to spend taxpayer
 
04:32:12.269 --> 04:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
dollars freely without audit reports and
 
04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
without making sure that applications
 
04:32:16.830 --> 04:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
are done correctly if the New Hampshire
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
retirement system said we're not sharing
 
04:32:21.630 --> 04:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
our reports with you and our audits are
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
yours but we're still not going to share
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
them would you let that stand the data
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
belongs to the state but we don't have
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
it I pay my taxes and I'm very proud to
 
04:32:36.429 --> 04:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
support the dairy Public School District
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
because I want an educated
 
04:32:41.109 --> 04:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
citizenry less money from the state for
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
Education will will end up requiring
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
local property taxes to go up reading
 
04:32:49.590 --> 04:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
comments on social media about taxes I
 
04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
don't see that as fairing well for those
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
elected for districts like Manchester
 
04:32:59.070 --> 04:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
where I work that have a tax cap it will
 
04:33:00.910 --> 04:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
cut Services
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
deeply maybe you don't realize that
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's the taxpayers who pay
 
04:33:08.029 --> 04:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
for these students at least twice in
 
04:33:11.310 --> 04:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
most cases more often than you realize
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
students are enrolled in Charter or
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
private schools and the money that
 
04:33:17.070 --> 04:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
should have come to the district is
 
04:33:19.510 --> 04:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
taken away from the public schools to go
 
04:33:19.520 --> 04:33:20.429 align:start position:0%
taken away from the public schools to go
toward

04:33:20.429 --> 04:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
toward
 
04:33:23.470 --> 04:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
vouchers the thing is those kids end up
 
04:33:26.189 --> 04:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
coming back and we have to pay for them
 
04:33:27.910 --> 04:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
again because that money does not come
 
04:33:31.150 --> 04:33:31.160 align:start position:0%

exclude the rich from receiving aid but
 
04:35:23.349 --> 04:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
instead is disincentivizing hard work
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%

the United Church of Christ and I have
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
taught and been educated in both public
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
and private schools I have a lot of
 
04:37:14.830 --> 04:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
respect for a variety of educational
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities Public Schools offer uh
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're the Bedrock of our economy and
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
our democracy and they allow for an
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
educated citizenry and they give
 
04:37:29.869 --> 04:37:29.879 align:start position:0%
students an opportunity from whatever
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
background they have to be have a leg up
 
04:37:37.510 --> 04:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
and to um to have a stepping stone to
 
04:37:40.990 --> 04:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
equality so I think I strongly support
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
public schools I I think that um they
 
04:37:47.070 --> 04:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
also our community schools are the pride
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
and joy of our of our towns um I live in
 
04:37:52.750 --> 04:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County which is the second
 
04:37:56.189 --> 04:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
poorest county in New Hampshire and yet
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
our Regional School District supports
 
04:38:02.670 --> 04:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
Community Schools Regional
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
um Junior highs or middle schools uh a
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
regional uh high school and we have a
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
variety of programs um for special needs
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
children for and AP classes and Career
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
Education and arts and sports I think we
 
04:38:26.750 --> 04:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
do a really good job um I know that I
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
our children went to that school it
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't perfect I've taught in that
 
04:38:31.709 --> 04:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
school and I know that I didn't do a
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
perfect job every day but we worked our
 
04:38:36.750 --> 04:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
hardest and we believed in our children
 
04:38:39.629 --> 04:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
and we loved them what we the staff
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
cannot make up the difference for is
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
budget cuts and budget cuts were talked
 
04:38:45.869 --> 04:38:45.879 align:start position:0%
about earlier today I would like to say
 
04:38:47.709 --> 04:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
that there are two kinds of budget cuts
 
04:38:49.949 --> 04:38:49.959 align:start position:0%
I think that people see one would be
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
when the budget doesn't pass it becomes
 
04:38:56.789 --> 04:38:56.799 align:start position:0%
news that the budget was voted down I
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
think the budget cuts that people that
 
04:39:01.709 --> 04:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
most of us do not see are the budget
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
cuts that come from the administration
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
the school board the budget committees
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
that say um sharpen your pencils again
 
04:39:13.949 --> 04:39:13.959 align:start position:0%
we can't afford to we can't afford to go
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
to the voters with with with a budget
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's this
 
04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
high so and I the other I just think
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
that that this um will also create more
 
04:39:29.109 --> 04:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
income inequality the children who can't
 
04:39:31.109 --> 04:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
afford who come from families that can
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
afford to pay for uh public for private
 
04:39:36.910 --> 04:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
education will now be get a subsidy and
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
the children who come from families that
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
are financially strapped
 
04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
the the money from the fa isn't going to
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
make a difference for them thank you

04:41:31.868 --> 04:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
public school has either failed them or
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
they just um it wasn't the right fit for
 
04:41:37.070 --> 04:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
who they are as people I hope I don't
 
04:41:39.310 --> 04:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
know if any of you have children but
 
04:41:41.788 --> 04:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
each child is unique and each child is
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
special and each one requires different
 
04:41:47.948 --> 04:41:47.958 align:start position:0%
things for their education we have
 
04:41:50.190 --> 04:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
several students uh that have come from
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
the public school because it wasn't the
 
04:41:55.788 --> 04:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
right fit and all I'm asking is that you
 
04:41:58.750 --> 04:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
would consider whatever it takes mindset
 
04:42:01.830 --> 04:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
and we have many many families who can't
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
um access the funding because they're
 
04:42:08.190 --> 04:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
just above that line we have 61% of our
 
04:42:11.590 --> 04:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
um families who do access the EF and
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for supporting that
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
but we also have families who it's
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
really really hard for them because in
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
that application that they fill out
 
04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that talks about what
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
their struggles are in life whether they
 
04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
have four children or as you heard
 
04:42:30.628 --> 04:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
somebody else somebody had cancer in
 
04:42:32.350 --> 04:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
their family and they had an unexpected
 
04:42:34.910 --> 04:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
CA somebody lost a job all of that is
 
04:42:38.310 --> 04:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
not a story that is told online and all
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
you can see is that number and so all
 
04:42:43.310 --> 04:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is for the whatever it takes
 
04:42:45.868 --> 04:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
mindset when you look at those kiddos
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
who the public school is not the right
 
04:42:51.150 --> 04:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
fit for um and I thank you for um
 
04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
listening to all of us today and I I'm
 
04:42:56.430 --> 04:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
hoping that you'll make um the decision
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
what's best for all kids thank you thank
 
04:42:59.550 --> 04:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
you very
 
04:43:03.708 --> 04:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
much yes representative yes thank thank
 
04:43:05.708 --> 04:43:05.718 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank thank you for uh
 
04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question roughly what's
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
tuition at your in college currently are
 
04:43:13.230 --> 04:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
currently our tuition is
 
04:43:17.310 --> 04:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
10,500 and it does not um it's not the
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
accurate number for what it takes to
 
04:43:20.430 --> 04:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
educate the child but we know that we
 
04:43:23.070 --> 04:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
can't ask for more than that right now
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
because it's really hard for those
 
04:43:27.510 --> 04:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
families and also is a very rural um not
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
wealthy area of our state as you know so
 
04:43:33.628 --> 04:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
uh we have a gap and we have to make up
 
04:43:37.030 --> 04:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
for that quite a bit with um
 
04:43:41.550 --> 04:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
fundraising thank you further questions
 
04:43:44.430 --> 04:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh yes go ahead rep
 
04:43:45.750 --> 04:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't even know the answer to that
 
04:43:47.350 --> 04:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking off the cuff can you tell
 
04:43:50.590 --> 04:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
me what you provide for special ed kids
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
well unfortunately we cannot we don't
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
have a St we don't have the money to
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
afford a special ed teacher now my heart
 
04:43:59.948 --> 04:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
is for the struggling learner would I
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
love to have a special Edge education
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
teacher on our staff absolutely we do
 
04:44:09.150 --> 04:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
have students with um IEPs and we
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
struggle with how to help them because
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have the staff to accommodate
 
04:44:15.910 --> 04:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
their needs we do our very very best
 
04:44:17.470 --> 04:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
because we have small group
 
04:44:17.480 --> 04:44:18.990 align:start position:0%
because we have small group
instruction

04:44:18.990 --> 04:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
04:44:21.270 --> 04:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
however they can't go back to where they
 
04:44:23.948 --> 04:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
were from due to some of the really hard
 
04:44:25.470 --> 04:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
stories and I'm not going to go through
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
those stories with you but they come
 
04:44:28.750 --> 04:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
from really hard stories about how the
 
04:44:30.910 --> 04:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
public school was not the right fit for
 
04:44:33.628 --> 04:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
their family and they can't go back and
 
04:44:36.910 --> 04:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
so and they both work so what do they do
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
they find the closest other source of
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
education for their family
 
04:44:44.350 --> 04:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
um so I wish we could provide that
 
04:44:46.270 --> 04:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
because I love the struggling Learners
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
they are my jam but um we can't provide
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
for them because we don't have the money
 
04:44:53.310 --> 04:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
for a staff member because we want to
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
keep the cost down for a large
 
04:44:58.590 --> 04:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
population of people thank you
 
04:45:01.590 --> 04:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
y yes represent
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
bton I'm surprised by your last
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
statement because the Federal Law
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
requires every student to get a free and
 
04:45:11.230 --> 04:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate education in the least
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment but your school
 
04:45:16.948 --> 04:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
can't provide that and I guess some of
 
04:45:19.310 --> 04:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
the other schools can't either is that
 
04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
correct we cannot provide what the
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
public school does because the public
 
04:45:25.470 --> 04:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
school guarantees those things we as a
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
private school cannot guarantee those
 
04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
things but we can do our very very best
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
in a small group instruction environment
 
04:45:33.550 --> 04:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
to provide the best that we can but we
 
04:45:36.190 --> 04:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
don't have if the IEP requires that
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
child to have a staff member to be with
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
them we can't and we let them know
 
04:45:44.190 --> 04:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
before they sign on the agreement that
 
04:45:45.868 --> 04:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
that is not something that we can
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
provide so they understand that going
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
into our school and please know I I
 
04:45:51.628 --> 04:45:51.638 align:start position:0%
respect what you're doing I'm not in any
 
04:45:53.990 --> 04:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
way critical at that thank you for your
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
answer y thank you very much any further
 
04:46:01.750 --> 04:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you so much uh
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:18.910 --> 04:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
good hello thank you for this
 
04:46:24.270 --> 04:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh my name is Katherine abot
 
04:46:25.230 --> 04:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'm from
 
04:46:27.628 --> 04:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
Portsmith um I'm a traditional home
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
educator uh he EFA is not homeschool and
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
I feel needs to be kept separate and
 
04:46:33.240 --> 04:46:34.230 align:start position:0%
I feel needs to be kept separate and
clearly

04:46:34.230 --> 04:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
04:46:37.990 --> 04:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
defined um I receive zero funding from
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
any government agencies my family's
 
04:46:43.310 --> 04:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
annual income is under the federal
 
04:46:45.670 --> 04:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
poverty guidelines and I'm a single
 
04:46:48.310 --> 04:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
mother so I no way feel that I am an
 
04:46:51.868 --> 04:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
elitist as commented earlier um but this
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
in no way has kept me from providing a
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
robust quality multifaceted education uh
 
04:47:00.230 --> 04:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
for my children I'm able to do this by
 
04:47:02.910 --> 04:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
living within my means and being a good
 
04:47:04.868 --> 04:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
Steward of the resources the Lord has
 
04:47:08.230 --> 04:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
given me and by his grace um proponents
 
04:47:10.548 --> 04:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
for Universal efas claim that the
 
04:47:12.430 --> 04:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
program CRI will be giving families a
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
choice uh this hearkens to we're from
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
the government and we're here to help um
 
04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
I maintain that Universal efas are not
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
giving parents a choice parents have
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
always had a choice parents have a
 
04:47:29.110 --> 04:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
choice uh Universal efas will be giving
 
04:47:31.548 --> 04:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
families a higher tax burden and more
 
04:47:34.270 --> 04:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
government oversight um I see that there
 
04:47:36.110 --> 04:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
is a lot of money to be made and
 
04:47:38.110 --> 04:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
political power to be gained through a
 
04:47:41.788 --> 04:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
EFA policy um it's my my position that
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
Universal efas will be Paving the way
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
for increased taxes new taxes such as a
 
04:47:49.788 --> 04:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
sales tax increased oversight and
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
regulation imposed on non-public school
 
04:47:54.430 --> 04:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
families overreaching policy by
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
government agencies and the loss of the
 
04:47:57.470 --> 04:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:48:00.868 --> 04:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
Advantage um I've noted these concerns
 
04:48:02.830 --> 04:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
out of looking at other states that have
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
implemented such programs I believe uh
 
04:48:08.350 --> 04:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
South Dakota and Arizona um I believe
 
04:48:10.110 --> 04:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
those were what I was looking at um I
 
04:48:13.948 --> 04:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
feel the unversal EF EFA bill is
 
04:48:16.390 --> 04:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous and uh the endgame is more
 
04:48:18.190 --> 04:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
government control and intrusion and
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
families that just want to be kept out
 
04:48:22.670 --> 04:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
of it um I'm respectfully requesting
 
04:48:24.708 --> 04:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
that the state be fiscally responsible
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
with taxpayer money and a good Steward
 
04:48:29.350 --> 04:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the resources by voting against
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
universally a face thank you no
 
04:48:32.708 --> 04:48:32.718 align:start position:0%

Candia New Hampshire I here I'm opposed
 
04:49:15.868 --> 04:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
to lifting the cap uh my only claim to
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
fame is that I was on the board of
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
Selectmen uh in Candia for I served one
 
04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
term and then I uh didn't run again
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
there are some very good private schools
 
04:49:29.708 --> 04:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
in this state including holderness
 
04:49:32.590 --> 04:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
Academy St Paul's School dairyfield
 
04:49:36.910 --> 04:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh Philips exitor Academy they cost
 
04:49:36.920 --> 04:49:38.510 align:start position:0%
uh Philips exitor Academy they cost
$50,000

04:49:38.510 --> 04:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
$50,000
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
plus um they have program St Paul's
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
School has a program if you make the
 
04:49:45.628 --> 04:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
family makes less than
 
04:49:49.270 --> 04:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
$150,000 tuition free Philips exitor
 
04:49:51.990 --> 04:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
Academy if the family makes
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
$125,000 or less tuition
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
free if they're making hundreds of
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
thousands or millions of dollars and
 
04:50:02.708 --> 04:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
there are many more in this state than
 
04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
you might think they pay the full vote
 
04:50:10.190 --> 04:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
so my question to this committee is why
 
04:50:13.830 --> 04:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
should lowincome New Hampshire
 
04:50:18.430 --> 04:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers contribute money to give
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
$5,200 to people in the EFA program
 
04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
making hundreds of thousands or millions
 
04:50:25.360 --> 04:50:26.230 align:start position:0%
making hundreds of thousands or millions
of

04:50:26.230 --> 04:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:50:28.590 --> 04:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
dollars I mean we've got people in
 
04:50:31.708 --> 04:50:31.718 align:start position:0%
Candia who are scraping by to pay their
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
taxes they're living on Social Security
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
and their savings they paid off their
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
mortgage over a lifetime and now they
 
04:50:44.350 --> 04:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
find out they're getting a tax bill that
 
04:50:46.350 --> 04:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
probably approaches what they were
 
04:50:49.110 --> 04:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
paying for a mortgage instead I would
 
04:50:51.868 --> 04:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
say we ought to be paying money to the
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
04:50:57.868 --> 04:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
because governor sonunu in his executive
 
04:51:00.628 --> 04:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
summary for
 
04:51:04.150 --> 04:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
20242 had a graph showing that for 15
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
years from 2008 to
 
04:51:11.948 --> 04:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
2023 state aid to education went up 12
 
04:51:15.270 --> 04:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
.3% inflation went up
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
41% we've been underfunding our schools
 
04:51:22.910 --> 04:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
not just that's Democratic Republican
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
legislators and administrations for
 
04:51:28.190 --> 04:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
years and the result has been people are
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with their public schools
 
04:51:33.030 --> 04:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
that we've been under funding for 15
 
04:51:35.948 --> 04:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
years or more we need to put more money
 
04:51:37.628 --> 04:51:37.638 align:start position:0%
in our Public
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%

04:51:45.868 --> 04:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
backbone of the educational system of
 
04:51:48.270 --> 04:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
this country and this state and we ought
 
04:51:49.590 --> 04:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much any questions

we oppose House Bill
 
04:52:50.030 --> 04:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
115 the state legislature has an
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to act to make meaningful
 
04:52:54.590 --> 04:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
school funding change this legislative
 
04:52:56.788 --> 04:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
session New Hampshire schools have
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
affirmed over and over decade after
 
04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
decade the state's constitutional
 
04:53:03.070 --> 04:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund an adequate education
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
and reaffirm this in the Superior Court
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
decisions in
 
04:53:09.708 --> 04:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
2023 the state continues to fail to meet
 
04:53:11.948 --> 04:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
its Constitution obligation to fund
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
public education leaving a significant
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
Gap in funding between what it
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
contributes per student and the actual
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
cost of Education the differen is
 
04:53:22.510 --> 04:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
driving New Hampshire's property tax
 
04:53:24.350 --> 04:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
rates to be among the very highest of
 
04:53:27.628 --> 04:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
the 50 states in the conal case the
 
04:53:29.868 --> 04:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
court wrote base adequacy can be no less
 
04:53:32.070 --> 04:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
than $
 
04:53:35.628 --> 04:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
7,356 1 per pupil per year and the true
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
cost is much likely much higher than
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
that if the legislature adopted such a
 
04:53:42.310 --> 04:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
change it could shift more of the
 
04:53:43.990 --> 04:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for funding public
 
04:53:46.510 --> 04:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
education to the state and reduce local
 
04:53:50.070 --> 04:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
property taxes hb15 relative to
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
Universal eligibility for Education
 
04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program could cost the
 
04:53:58.470 --> 04:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
state approximately 102 to $130 million
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the 2025 2026 school year in closing
 
04:54:04.910 --> 04:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
those schools are funds that would be
 
04:54:07.390 --> 04:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
diverted from the education trust fund
 
04:54:09.670 --> 04:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
the state's public school funding source
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
is imperative for the state legislature
 
04:54:13.948 --> 04:54:13.958 align:start position:0%
to ensure all such funds are used to
 
04:54:16.350 --> 04:54:16.360 align:start position:0%
benefit public schools and the property
 
04:54:19.030 --> 04:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers supporting them and not divert
 
04:54:22.270 --> 04:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
that funding for Universal efas as New

Hampshire residents parents and property
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we are calling on the
 
04:54:28.470 --> 04:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
legislature to develop an equitable and
 
04:54:30.948 --> 04:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
comprehensive school funding solution
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
that works for every community in New

04:54:36.430 --> 04:54:36.440 align:start position:0%

deserve and the state has the obligation
 
04:56:31.230 --> 04:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
04:56:35.310 --> 04:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
that that is a have to with our revenue

legislature has decided to do and we are
 
04:56:54.150 --> 04:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
opposing hb15 because making that
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
program Universal is taking limited
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
resources that we have in the
 
04:57:03.070 --> 04:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
state with um decreasing revenues coming
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
in and a predicted shortfall this fiscal
 
04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
year at the end of the year and the uh
 
04:57:11.548 --> 04:57:11.558 align:start position:0%
governor already telling us we have to
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
tighten our belt and cut the state
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
budgets you aren't going to have enough
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
money to fund both we can't afford two
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
education systems was that two minutes
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
already that's two
 
04:57:26.830 --> 04:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
minutes okay in that case I will pass
 
04:57:29.390 --> 04:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
around my testimony but you have an
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
obligation to all of our public school
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
students to fully fund public schools
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
and as much as it is great that parents
 
04:57:37.948 --> 04:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
want to find a better fit the state does
 
04:57:39.310 --> 04:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
not have an obligation to fund it and
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it right now and you
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
can read the rest of it in my
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
testimony all right thank you uh next
 
04:57:57.030 --> 04:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
yeah hi everyone good evening we don't
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
usually get to say that up here um my
 
04:58:06.350 --> 04:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
name is Christine cyber representative
 
04:58:09.390 --> 04:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
Christine cyber I uhhuh if you're a rep
 
04:58:11.190 --> 04:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
you should really push name down oh yeah
 
04:58:13.390 --> 04:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I forgot you don't have to but
 
04:58:15.190 --> 04:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's nice kind of get you up in the anti
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit I forget sometimes um yeah
 
04:58:19.830 --> 04:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
so my name is representative Christine
 
04:58:22.750 --> 04:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
cyber I'm from Manchester's board one
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I won't take up much of your time
 
04:58:27.030 --> 04:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
but I really enjoyed some of the just
 
04:58:29.030 --> 04:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
previous speakers that we had I feel
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
like we're hearing a lot of very
 
04:58:33.868 --> 04:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
important voices that need to be heard
 
04:58:36.430 --> 04:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
in this conversation there's like really
 
04:58:38.670 --> 04:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
two main arguments that are very highly
 
04:58:41.990 --> 04:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
politicized in this whole um just
 
04:58:43.628 --> 04:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
everything we're talking about with the
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
expansion and the vouchers in
 
04:58:48.430 --> 04:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
general um and a lot of bad arguments
 
04:58:50.788 --> 04:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
going around with the entire thing the
 
04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
one huge problem I have with this with
 
04:58:56.190 --> 04:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
this especially this particular bill
 
04:58:59.190 --> 04:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
with expanding the vouchers is the lack
 
04:59:01.110 --> 04:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
of accountability and
 
04:59:03.548 --> 04:59:03.558 align:start position:0%
transparency and you know the biggest
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
thing is the audit we weren't allowed to
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
well we're supposed to be able to look
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
at the audit it's very confusing as to
 
04:59:12.750 --> 04:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
why we cannot subpoena the papers we
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
need to do I feel like we should not
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
take any action on this particular Bill
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
until we can fully get those numbers to
 
04:59:23.628 --> 04:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
see what is going on with that and is
 
04:59:26.830 --> 04:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
this worth expanding and also how much
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
money is just not being accounted for um
 
04:59:32.470 --> 04:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
I feel like a big part of folks that are
 
04:59:34.590 --> 04:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
being left out of this argument as well
 
04:59:36.830 --> 04:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
are the taxpayers who have no children
 
04:59:39.510 --> 04:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
such as myself it is not fair for them
 
04:59:41.548 --> 04:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
especially with with a large majority of
 
04:59:44.590 --> 04:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
our of our population being over you
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
know being in the elderly age range and
 
04:59:49.628 --> 04:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
retired they can't afford that they live
 
04:59:52.350 --> 04:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
on fixed incomes and this will cause
 
04:59:56.070 --> 04:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
property taxes to go up so in turn I
 
04:59:58.190 --> 04:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
would just like us to actually keep the
 
05:00:00.628 --> 05:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
school choice we've had all along and
 
05:00:03.230 --> 05:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
fully fund our public education system
 
05:00:05.230 --> 05:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
which honestly we never tried to do in
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
the first place when the lawsuits were
 
05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
brought up back with Claremont thank
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and I appreciate
 
05:00:15.548 --> 05:00:15.558 align:start position:0%
um yeah everything you guys are doing
 
05:00:23.860 --> 05:00:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:23.870 --> 05:00:25.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:00:25.310 --> 05:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:00:27.230 --> 05:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hawkins well if you have to go you got
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
to go that's right we've had several
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:37.510 --> 05:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
that good evening Brian um thank you uh
 
05:00:39.310 --> 05:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee for
 
05:00:40.948 --> 05:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
the record Brian Hawkins representing
 
05:00:43.070 --> 05:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
Nea New Hampshire looking forward to
 
05:00:44.430 --> 05:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
getting to know the new committee
 
05:00:48.390 --> 05:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
members here um as we go forward um so
 
05:00:50.110 --> 05:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
I'm here today in opposition to House
 
05:00:53.430 --> 05:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 115 uh as you are aware there's two
 
05:00:56.830 --> 05:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
Court decisions that have been uh making
 
05:00:59.070 --> 05:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
their way through the process but it
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
thus far has reaffirmed that the state
 
05:01:02.990 --> 05:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
is not meeting its obligation under our
 
05:01:05.070 --> 05:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution to provide an adequate
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
public education I'm going to skip a lot
 
05:01:08.910 --> 05:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
of things that I have in some written
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um but since 1 15 House Bill
 
05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
115 would throw open the door to
 
05:01:17.070 --> 05:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
diverting more public funds for a second
 
05:01:19.150 --> 05:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
private voucher education I think you
 
05:01:21.150 --> 05:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
need to look at the experience that the
 
05:01:23.510 --> 05:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
states who have done so have had with
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
this um adventure and that is uh you
 
05:01:30.190 --> 05:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
know first we'll look at Arizona the
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
program is costing a billion dollars a
 
05:01:35.590 --> 05:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
year now in taxpayer dollars it is
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for half of the budget
 
05:01:40.990 --> 05:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
deficit that they faced uh um this past
 
05:01:43.190 --> 05:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
year and in order to fill that budget
 
05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
Gap they had to do significant cuts to a
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
number of programs including to higher
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
education um and we know that the only
 
05:01:52.150 --> 05:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
other place for that to be made up at
 
05:01:55.070 --> 05:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
the local level as has been stated today
 
05:01:58.750 --> 05:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
is local property uh taxes because as we
 
05:02:01.548 --> 05:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
have seen in New Hampshire and in the
 
05:02:04.390 --> 05:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
states that have expanded to either a
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
universal program or even
 
05:02:08.430 --> 05:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
significantly uh with some of the
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
proposals that were passed uh excuse me
 
05:02:15.310 --> 05:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
failed last year uh here in the state 75
 
05:02:17.628 --> 05:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
to 80% of those students are students
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
who were not in a public school and so
 
05:02:22.990 --> 05:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
that is new funds that the state has to
 
05:02:25.948 --> 05:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
uh come up with and as I said is now um
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
a second of education system um that uh
 
05:02:33.948 --> 05:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
the state is obligating itself to fund
 
05:02:35.948 --> 05:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
so I'll close with saying instead of
 
05:02:38.670 --> 05:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
sending more taxpayer money to private
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
schools we should should focus on the
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
public schools where nearly 90% of our
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
children attend not take money away from
 
05:02:47.070 --> 05:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
them we need to do things like reduce
 
05:02:48.990 --> 05:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
class sizes we need to solve the teacher
 
05:02:51.190 --> 05:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
shortage and the educator shortage
 
05:02:54.310 --> 05:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
crisis that we are under um we need to
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
fund special
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
education um and we need to reduce class
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
sizes and so with these questions in
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
mind um and Hampshire respectively asks
 
05:03:06.270 --> 05:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
the education funding committee to find
 
05:03:08.990 --> 05:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 115 in expedient to legislate
 
05:03:10.590 --> 05:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time happy to take any
 
05:03:12.548 --> 05:03:12.558 align:start position:0%

professionals various support staff
 
05:03:36.868 --> 05:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
roles in schools some of it depends on
 
05:03:41.270 --> 05:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
the uh School District uh but not not um
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%

ack okay so just want to say can you get
 
05:05:24.750 --> 05:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:30.910 --> 05:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
Au yes uh okay I lived in New Hampshire
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
all my life I uh was attached to the
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
fifth special forces in VI on from
 
05:05:41.948 --> 05:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
August 69 to August
 
05:05:46.150 --> 05:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
70 okay so I was born in nashwa I went
 
05:05:47.830 --> 05:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
to Catholic schools All My Life as a
 
05:05:51.670 --> 05:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
matter of fact in the eth grade my my
 
05:05:55.708 --> 05:05:55.718 align:start position:0%
classmate was Mark aot the
 
05:05:57.948 --> 05:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
governor's father and I also went to
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
Bishop Bradley with him graduated from
 
05:06:01.548 --> 05:06:01.558 align:start position:0%
there so I I have that association with
 
05:06:04.628 --> 05:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
them um I am against this bill even
 
05:06:06.030 --> 05:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
though I went to Catholic schools all my
 
05:06:07.990 --> 05:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
life and it's interesting because when I
 
05:06:09.310 --> 05:06:09.320 align:start position:0%
was going to Catholic school you know
 
05:06:11.708 --> 05:06:11.718 align:start position:0%
how they funded it the nuns the nuns
 
05:06:13.948 --> 05:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
were paid a dollar a day and the rest
 
05:06:16.628 --> 05:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
was paid from bingo bingo is a big thing
 
05:06:19.350 --> 05:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
and that's that's footed our school so
 
05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh I'm opposed to this because even
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
though I went to Catholic schools my
 
05:06:25.868 --> 05:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
parents paid for it tax paid didn't have
 
05:06:27.470 --> 05:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
to pay for it and it was our choice and
 
05:06:29.390 --> 05:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
I thought it was appropriate because I
 
05:06:30.868 --> 05:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
had the special education I want I had
 
05:06:32.910 --> 05:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
half a day in French and half a day I
 
05:06:35.470 --> 05:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
had Catholic Education so the whole time
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
nobody else had to pay for it we paid
 
05:06:38.070 --> 05:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
for it because that's what we wanted we
 
05:06:40.270 --> 05:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
wanted it differently so Meanwhile my
 
05:06:43.548 --> 05:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
kids went to public school in Manchester
 
05:06:46.350 --> 05:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
and one of the teachers Mrs barui helped
 
05:06:48.750 --> 05:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
my my uh oldest granddaughter that went
 
05:06:50.708 --> 05:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
to that school fifth grade when she
 
05:06:53.548 --> 05:06:53.558 align:start position:0%
transferred from m m New York she had
 
05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
troubles that Miss buuy helped her a lot
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
and there's other instances my another
 
05:07:02.548 --> 05:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
of his sister she ended up being the
 
05:07:05.830 --> 05:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
national championship goalie and so as a
 
05:07:08.110 --> 05:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
result she got a full boat scholarship
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
to Cushing Academy it was 75,000 a year
 
05:07:12.548 --> 05:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
after one year she says no I'm going
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
back to Central so I I really think the
 
05:07:17.548 --> 05:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
public schools do a good job and I'm
 
05:07:19.150 --> 05:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to insult you guys
 
05:07:21.190 --> 05:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
but to me the main problem is we're all
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
fighting over the money because you guys
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
didn't do your job you're not fulfilling
 
05:07:28.590 --> 05:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and adequately funding
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
our education system and I think that's
 
05:07:33.030 --> 05:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
wrong on your part I know a lot of the
 
05:07:34.548 --> 05:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
voters say I don't want to pay the taxes
 
05:07:36.270 --> 05:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to pay the taxes because we
 
05:07:38.470 --> 05:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
need it because it's for our kids and to
 
05:07:40.110 --> 05:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
not do that is
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's negligent it's against the
 
05:07:44.788 --> 05:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
Constitution so to me we just you guys
 
05:07:47.310 --> 05:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
just celebrated cutting the interest and
 
05:07:49.390 --> 05:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
dividence tax would cost cut $160
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
million off our budget we could have
 
05:07:52.750 --> 05:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
used that for the schools so to me I'm
 
05:07:55.270 --> 05:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
willing to have a sales tax income tax
 
05:07:57.230 --> 05:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
both taxes whatever I don't care let's
 
05:07:59.948 --> 05:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
take care of our our kids for all of the
 
05:08:01.430 --> 05:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
kids that way we take care of all the
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
needs because I think like has been said
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are dedicated to the
 
05:08:08.948 --> 05:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
kids and and in another incident one of
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
my children and uh I was very homophobic
 
05:08:13.590 --> 05:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
came out to a guidance counselor and
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
helped her get through school until she
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
was felt comfortable enough to tell me
 
05:08:20.788 --> 05:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
about it so the school systems the the
 
05:08:22.750 --> 05:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
people School teachers are so dedicated
 
05:08:24.070 --> 05:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
they really love the kids they care for
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
the kids they best interest and we got
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
to give them the resources they can
 
05:08:30.670 --> 05:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
continue to do a good job that's my say
 
05:08:33.030 --> 05:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
so please raise taxes get money for the
 
05:08:37.230 --> 05:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
kids please thank you Roger yeah any any
