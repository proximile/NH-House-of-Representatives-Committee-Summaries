00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
and I just don't see anybody going in
 
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
and taking that risk the only way people
 
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
are going to build offshore wind of any
 
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
type is the only way they've only done
 
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
it every place that's been built and
 
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
that's with a government edict for
 
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
example in Massachusetts they would put
 
00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
into Vineyard one well the utilities in
 
00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts were told you will bid you
 
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
will get a purchase power agreement with
 
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
vineyard one you don't have any option
 
00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
go negotiate your best deal but you're
 
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
buying their power and sure if not
 
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
having that government mandate no one's
 
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
willing to invest their own money in
 
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and I think it's a pretty
 
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
good rule of thumb when you say if
 
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
people aren't willing to invest their
 
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
own money in an idea it's probably not a
 
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
very good idea so I think having this
 
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
office is Superfluous nothing's
 
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
happening if for some reason I'm 100%
 
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
wrong and five years from now people
 
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
decide to invest their own money in
 
00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
offshore wind which I highly doubt will
 
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
happen but if it did we can bring the
 
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
office back no sense in wasting money on
 
00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
it now because it's accomplishing
 
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
nothing and I'll take any
 
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington for introducing House Bill
 
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
682 now I know you have served on the
 
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
offshore wind commission for the last
 
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years and you follow the
 
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
developments in offshore wind
 
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
closely I noticed that uh the CEO of
 
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
orad which is the biggest wind turbine
 
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
developer in the world was fired a
 
00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
couple of days ago and their stock has
 
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
fallen by like 80% and they're taking uh
 
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
huge losses what impact do you think
 
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
that will have on the offshore wind
 
00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
industry well I I I think the losses
 
00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 align:start position:0%
were something like if I read it
 
00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 align:start position:0%
correctly $ 1.7 billion doar and
 
00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
obviously it's going to have a negative
 
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
effect because this is the company
 
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's the Forefront they've got not
 
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
only do they have have invested in it
 
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
but they also have all the equipment
 
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
they have the Jones act compliant ships
 
00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
and they have all the equipment to you
 
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
know to build offsh a wind turbance uh
 
00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
having them back off like that sends a
 
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
strong message to anybody else don't get
 
00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 align:start position:0%
in this business because you're going to
 
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
lose money if you
 
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
do can you tell us who builds floating
 
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
wind turbines right now I'm not that
 
00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
familiar I think there's some uh built
 
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
off the coast of Japan but it's very
 
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
limited it's not the the fixed platform
 
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
wind turbines all over the world and
 
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
they've been up especially over in
 
00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
Europe uh for for many many many years
 
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's a known technology
 
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
there but there's a lot of new variables
 
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
that come in with floating because
 
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
obviously you got to look at I mean I
 
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 align:start position:0%
think everyone's probably saw the movie
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
The Perfect Storm you're looking at the
 
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
potential of 50 60 foot waves that
 
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
platform's got to go up 50 or 60 feet
 
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
and come back down now they're designed
 
00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
the last I saw was designed to withstand
 
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
110 mph winds which is probably not
 
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
going to be exceeded unless there's a
 
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
very rare hurricane off the coast of uh
 
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but they don't operate at
 
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
over 50 m an hour so I mean every winter
 
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
we get one or two or three nor easers
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
that come up the coast where we have
 
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
sustained winds of 60 70 M an hour for a
 
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
couple of days and not only that you
 
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
combine that with the fact that snowing
 
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
out which there goes your solar now you
 
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
got your wind offshore wind shut down I
 
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
mean this really sets us up and I think
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at the scenario put forward
 
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 align:start position:0%
by ISO New England on their October 24th
 
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
report they're saying that with a I
 
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
think it's I know it's a 20 megawatt 20
 
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
gaw pardon me of offshore wind we will
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
still require 12 gaw of dispatchable
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
power that only runs less than 1% of the
 
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
time now to put that in perspective
 
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's five seab Brook stations of
 
00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
course it won't be CBR stations because
 
00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 align:start position:0%
they can't fluctuate up and down it'll
 
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
be gas turbines because that's the
 
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
cheapest because we're going to make the
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
cheapest one you can build because
 
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're not going to run very often and I
 
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
asked well how are we going to pay for
 
00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
this if they only run less than 1% of
 
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
the time I was told by ISO that we'll
 
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
pay for it by putting them in the
 
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
capacity Market which means these plants
 
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
that run less than 1% of the time are
 
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
going to set the price for the for Ford
 
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
capacity Market which means every
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
generator in New England is going to get
 
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
paid an astronomical price this is cost
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
this would cost billions of dollars and
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
that's a direct result of having this
 
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
offshore win which is unreliable and you
 
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
can't depend on it when it's when it
 
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
works you can say over an average we be
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
fine but we don't base our Electric
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
System on the average we base it on the
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
acute day when I need power now can you
 
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
deliver sorry call me tomorrow that's
 
00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
not good
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
enough so did I understand you to say
 
00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
that not only is offshore wind expensive
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
at $150 a megawatt hour but it also
 
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
increases other expenses on the grid for
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
these backup plants if we would go with
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
the capacity Market you're talking about
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
probably tripling quadrupling the price
 
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
of the capacity Market Market this is
 
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars and it's the fact
 
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
comes down to it that again we don't
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
want our electricity we don't judge our
 
00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 align:start position:0%
electric service on averages we judge it
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
on instantaneous reliability and if you
 
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
can't give me the power I need now then
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
I get a problem that means I have to
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
have a backup and someone's going to pay
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
for that backup it's not
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
free further questions for
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative McGee
 
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for presenting
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
this bill so my question is you were
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
serving on um on the offshore wind
 
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
commission and I know the other states
 
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
were more anxious around this than we
 
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
were we were there observing and uh
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're always a little bit recalcitrant
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether or not it was
 
00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 align:start position:0%
something we were interested in but my
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
understanding was that the plans were
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
always for the turbines to be in the
 
00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine because the wind is
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
preferable there and the part that New
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was was supposed to play was
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
it coming on Shore uh to get to an
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
eversource interconnection in Portsmouth
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
at least that's what I had heard is that
 
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
we were looking to um beef up Workforce
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
in order to support the onshoring of
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
that power from the Gulf of Maine so um
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is are the other
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
states decide have the other states oped
 
00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
not to go
 
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 align:start position:0%
forward uh and if they are still going
 
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
forward and we are simply pulling back
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
on investigating or
 
00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
participating will that still result in
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
higher rates for us since we're on a
 
00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.670 align:start position:0%
higher rates for us since we're on a
regional

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
regional
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
grid well well there's a lot to that
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
question I could I could answer that for
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
probably 45 minutes and bore the hell
 
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
out of everybody with it but I I'll try
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
to a little bit uh more concise than
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
that yeah the other states are different
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
but remember the other states have an
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
edict the government is making the
 
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
decision not private Enterprises the
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
utilities aren't saying this is the best
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
way to serve my customers by building
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
offshore wind they're being told by the
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
government you will develop offshore
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
wind we don't care what it costs go
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
figure it out do it and Conneticut for
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
example has backed out it was supposed
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
to be a three-state uh I guess m Mutual
 
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
contract between massachusett Rhode
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
Island and Connecticut Connecticut
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
pulled out of it because they looked at
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
it and says it just it costs too much
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island in Massachusetts was
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
supposed to come out with a figure last
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
summer which they put off to the fall
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
which they put off till after the
 
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
election which I Now understand has been
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
put off until March so they still
 
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
haven't come out with a with a price on
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
it I'm not sure where they're locating I
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
would assume they're going to be off the
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
which means they can use fixed platform
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
wi because the depth is lower the Gulf
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
of Maine does not allow that it's just
 
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
too deep if somebody wanted to go into
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of main um I mean it's
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
federally licensed uh they could I I
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
assume they could bring this uh on Shore
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
they would have to go through the site
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
evaluation Committee in New Hampshire to
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
bring the uh transmiss a new
 
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
transmission line from the shore to
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
wherever it went even if went just to
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so that would have to be
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh litigated that way but I I just uh I
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't really see uh the other state
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
saying your utility rate payers are
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
going to pay to build offshore wind off
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
the coast of Maine or New Hampshire and
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh uh uh we're going to
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
have them build jobs and infrastructure
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
and all this other stuff all those jobs
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
and whatever are going to come from
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Island because of the
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
ones paying for it and I should mention
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
to be complete that there is one
 
00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
offshore wind project that's being done
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
by the state of Maine again it's a
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
government edict no one is voluntarily
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
spending a dime of their own money on it
 
00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
but they are building a small project as
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
a prototype floating one off the coast
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
of Maine and I think at least until that
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
comes out and we see that run for a few
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
years and what the results are uh we
 
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
should not spend a single more dime on
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
it we can just watch and see what
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
happens and then make a decision based
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
on actual knowledge rather than
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
Theory representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
you for being here representative I'm
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
going to piggyback on the chair's
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
question of the impact of wind power
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
investment because a CEO was fired um in
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
Maine Irving Oil has already announced a
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
10% increase of oil because of the
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
arbitrary tariffs that have been placed
 
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.710 align:start position:0%
arbitrary tariffs that have been placed
on

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
Canada um can you please tell me what
 
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
the impact of these tariffs are on
 
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
offshore wind power and wouldn't because
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doesn't have oil and gas
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
but we do have wood solar and wind
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we want to invest in creating
 
00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:52.110 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we want to invest in creating
energy

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
Independence I think you're confusing me
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not Donald Trump I mean just to make
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
that clear because uh you seem to be
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
confusing about that fact as far as the
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
I am not but thank you for the
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
clarification as far as the tariffs go
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
on that hang on a minute
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative Thomas you need to
 
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
secure the permission of the chair to
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
speak so please don't interrupt people
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
in the future uh if I'm being insulted
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call it call it out no
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're being instructed by the
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
chair that you're not allowed to speak
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's in house rules I can show you the
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
citation if you need to see it
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
that says you have to be recognized but
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
by the chair before you speak you
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
interrupted representative Harrington
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore I'm asking you not to do
 
00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
that again do you need a further
 
00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
clarification I have a question yes go
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
ahead if someone who is testifying
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
insults somebody who is a member of the
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
committee shouldn't it be the chair's
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to call that out yes it
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
would be the chair's responsibility I
 
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
heard no such insult
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you can answer
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
I'll answer the question in by as short
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
as I possibly can this this bill has
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with uh tariffs on Canada
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
or tariffs on anybody else it has to do
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
with putting the offshore wind at best
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
on hold because nothing's going to go
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
forward and we shouldn't be spending any
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
money on it till we have more facts
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
followup followup does this bill have
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
anything to do with a CEO being
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
fired I think the fact that the largest
 
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
in producer uh I think it's the largest
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
one had fired their CEO because they
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
pursued offshore wind says a lot about
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
the uh what people are willing to do
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
with offshore wind I.E when it comes to
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
their own money they're a little bit
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
conservative about spending it on
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and they think I would
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
assume they would think that their CEO
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
made the wrong decisions otherwise they
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have fired
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
them further questions for
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington representative
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
nter thank you uh could you please tell
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
me when you filed this
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
bill you repeat the question please when
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
did you file this bill when did I file
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
it timeline I I'm not sure whatever it
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
was in the whatever was allowed to do so
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
on uh the new system on OS so followup
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
so November follow months
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
ago yeah I guess it was probably yeah
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
November December yeah thank
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
you representative Swanson has a a
 
00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:34.519 align:start position:0%
question hi uh thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr Harrington uh did I understand
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
you correctly you asserted
 
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
that offshore wind only generates 1% of
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
the time did I did I hear that correctly
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
what's what percentage can you can you
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
repeat okay yeah no no that's not what
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
you heard what I was referring to is in
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at the iso New England
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
report it's dated October 24th it's like
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
transitioning to the new green energy or
 
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
something it's called you can find it on
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
their website what they said was and I
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
might have the number wrong I can't
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
remember if it was 20 gwatt or 25 GW of
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
offshore wind but assuming one of those
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
that there would then require
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
dispatchable which is not wind or solar
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
but dispatchable meaning turn on now and
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
give me 10 megawatts turn off turn back
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
on 2 hours from now give me 50 megaw
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
they would need 12 gaw of dispatchable
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
power that would operate less than 1% of
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
the time and my conjecture on that is
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
when you only operate less than 1% of
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
the time you're going to build the
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
cheapest plant you can because you're
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
not going to spend let's say money huge
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
amounts of money in building a nuclear
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
plant if it only operates 1% of the time
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
so you would build gas turbines which
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
but basically Jets which are the most
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
expensive least efficient way to burn
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
gas but did the cheapest to build those
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
are the ones that we would have have 12
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
gaw of now as far as the offshore wind
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
the capacity Factor on offshore wind is
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
fairly High compared to like on onshore
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
wind it's somewhere pushing around 50%
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
but again the problem is 50% is when the
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
wind decides it wants to blow not when
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
we decide we need the power so that
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
could run at 80% one day and 5% another
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
day and that's the problem why you have
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
to have this backup power followup
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
question M so
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
I uh installed my own solar system in my
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
house and it obviously is only going to
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
be working when the sun shines but it
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
does provide electricity to my neighbors
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
and supplements the grid as far as I
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
know there was no additional
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
construction of
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
more uh turbin or anything to offset
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
when I would be offline but uh I'm I'm
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
confused is the why would we take any
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
action here if it's not Mark if it isn't
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
profitable why would we prohibit anybody
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
from investing it if there's investment
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
that I don't think this it necessarily
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
prohibits it what it does is basically
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
say the state's not going to be involved
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
if if somebody if our friends from
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
eversource here decide we think it's a
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
great idea to build offshore wind in the
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine and they can convince that
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
the Pu that their costs are just in
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh and they can change state
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
law so that allows them to build
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
generation then go ahead but this just
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
says the state of New Hampshire is not
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
going to have an offshore wind industry
 
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
development office which where there's
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
no offshore wind to develop we're not
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to waste our money on it and just
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
if if indeed five years 10 years from
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
now the world changes we can bring this
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
back we just there's no there's no need
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
for it now so one further question
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
related to the uh's no point in having
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
in the office make it quick please um
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
would so somebody could still develop
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we want to be involved as far
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
as a state in whatever development takes
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
place even if it's completely invested
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
by the free
 
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959 align:start position:0%
market there's no prohibition by getting
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
rid of this this doesn't stop anybody
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
from investing in anything they want
 
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
just as like if someone decides they
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
want to build an SMR for example small
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
modular reactor in uh in New Hampshire
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
um they could do that if they want to
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
put on a uh a landbased wind farm they
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
can do do that if they want to put in a
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
utility size meaning you know 50
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar array they can do that
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
it's just simply says the state's not
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to have a specific office just to
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh to try to make that go it's that's
 
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
like we do every other generation
 
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
project in New Hampshire it just takes
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
it's done by the free market thank you
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
Mr Harington thank you Mr chair okay
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rand has a
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington for being
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
up there and taking questions on your
 
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.990 align:start position:0%
up there and taking questions on your
bill

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
um your points about uh the capacity
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
factor for offshore wind are are well
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
taken it's intermittent resource
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
although offshore wind as you noted has
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
a relatively high capacity Factor among
 
00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
a relatively high capacity Factor among
Renewables

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
Renewables
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
but in all among all the presentations
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
that the committee had to start the
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
session I never heard that um their New
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or or the grid for that the
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
New England grid for that
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
matter was short on fixed generation
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
assets dispatchable power plants uh and
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
for that matter if if the market needed
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
another natural gas plant as you noted
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
they're fairly cheap to build I assume
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
somebody could build one but what we did
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
here was that the
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
constraint on PO power in the New
 
00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:02.919 align:start position:0%
England grid is the supply of natural
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
gas we have limited pipeline capacity
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
region so if that's our greatest danger
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
isn't it in New Hampshire's interests to
 
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.430 align:start position:0%
isn't it in New Hampshire's interests to
facilitate

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
facilitate
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
the entry into the market of as many
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
generation assets as possible even if
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
they're intermittent so that whenever
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
they are generating whenever those
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
Renewables the offshore wind
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
generating the natural gas can be saved
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
for another hour when when it's needed I
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
mean why wouldn't we want to facilitate
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
the entry of more generation onto the
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
grid so that we could preserve our
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
natural gas and use it when we need it
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
well again you you you're confusing
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
average with instantaneous and I think
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's the issue you're talking about
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
something that does a capacity factor of
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 50% that means 50% of
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
the time it's producing nothing um and
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
as far as the saving the natural gas um
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
the the theory if you read the iso New
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
England paper is that when you put all
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
this offshore wind in that is mandated
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
by states which is the only way anybody
 
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
does it that will turn around and
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
they'll sign a fixed price contract what
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
with the utility in New England in
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Rhode Island and then
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
then in turn they'll bid in zero into
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
the daily energy markets which will tend
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
to drop the uh lmps which means the
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
wholesale price of electricity would
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
actually go down for the people who
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
aren't buying the offshore wind of
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
course that means a lot of these places
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
that we have for natural gas now that
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
are marginal certainly if you looked at
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
this winter we had a number of times
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
when we were producing there was one day
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
when the biggest generator of
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
electricity in New England was from oil
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
those will go out of business because
 
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to withstand that
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
lower price unless we turn around and
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
drastically increase the capacity the
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
Ford capacity market clearing price but
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
in in short of that you'll see that
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
there be less natural gas generators
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the iso New England is
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
contemplating basically they want to
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
wipe out their theory is you know if you
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
look at Massachusetts and Connecticut
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island get rid of fossil fuels
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
period so it's not going to happen
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
because you just you'd have to shut down
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
the grid but the goal there is to make
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
it so you use fossil fuels I.E Natural
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
Gas to the minimum extent possible this
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
whole turnover remember it involves uh
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
heat pumps and turning to
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
electrification of of cars
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
electrification of heating so the
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
natural gas supply is not going to be uh
 
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
challenged as much as it is now because
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
you just won't be using as much of it
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
but when those times when the offshore
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
wind is not doing and it's snowing out
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh that the nor Easter I was talking
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
about comes up the coast you're going to
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
need those 12 gaw of most likely natural
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
gas to produce when you say I need you
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
now so okay this is starting to sound
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
like a debate to me rather than a
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
discussion of the bill so I'm going to
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank representative Harrington for
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill and next call on
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
representative Abul Khan of sebr to give
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
us his perspective on this
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning representative
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
again good morning Mr chairman good
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
members I represent SE Brook uh dist uh
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 30 uh for this is my sixth
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
term and I am uh for this bill I'm I'm
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking for for this bill in
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
support of this bill uh Mr
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um I
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
also uh um the CBR also has one of the
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
biggest uh Fisherman's Cooperative
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
and few years ago I was also a member of
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
the uh windmill project Governor sunun
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
appointed me at the C Brooks
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
representative and I attended three uh
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
meetings at the past um uh facility of
 
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.549 align:start position:0%
meetings at the past um uh facility of
the

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
DS and all three uh meeting I requested
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
that a fisherman's representative should
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
be in the
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
committee and and the
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
organizers uh they did refused they said
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
that um I am their representative I
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
never went for fishing I cannot be the
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
fisherman's representative when the
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
fisherman has to have a seat in the
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
table so on advice from the C Board of
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
slackman I resigned from that Comm a
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
commission about four five six years ago
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
and since then it you know I watched
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
from outside that how it happened and
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
where it is
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
going um Mr chairman uh New Hamshire has
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
only 16 17 Mile
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
Coastline and we love our Coastline the
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
way it is and all the negative all the
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know negative things I heard from
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
all the residents and citizens of New
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is going to bring bad
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
effect to our uh natural beauty our
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
fishing industry even many many other
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
things that I you know that is going to
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
have a NE negative effect it's not going
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
to bring any Financial benefit to our
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
residents or citizens in New Hampshire
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh even though you know they're going to
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
produce electricity or whatever power
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
they will produce is not going to have
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
any benefit to it's going to go to the
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
greed uh through us and all the
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
disruption we're going to have in our
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
Coastline and everything else plus Mr uh
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
chairman as you know that this kind of
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
project they you know we have to think
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
about how they going to dismantle in
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
case they have to dismantle in future
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
and I do not hear you know too many
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
times that where is the money like um uh
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
me and uh representative Harrington we
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
both see and the uh nuclear dismantling
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
Comm commission and we have more than $1
 
00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
billion in case we had to have that and
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
this this industry doesn't have nothing
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
like that and we're going to be sit on
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
it in in case they leave us you know as
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
it is so Mr Mr chairman I'm totally
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
against it I uh we me and my family
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
moved to sebr in New Hampshire uh 25
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
years ago this month and the time we
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
moved here
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh we promis that the way uh you know uh
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
I raise my family the way I see it the
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
way I found it I will leave the New
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know if I die here we will
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
leave the New Hampshire better than we
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
found it so this will be a bad thing for
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
New Hamshire we should not vote for it I
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
ask all the Committee Member to vote for
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
it so we don't need any windmill thank
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'm ready to take any
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you questions for
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative of Khan representative
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
Khan for being with us this morning so
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
you testified that you don't think there
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
would be any benefit for New Hampshire
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
and I guess I want to drill down on that
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit um like many power plants
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
or power infrastructure there's a high
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
upfront cost but then beyond that
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
upfront cost the the energy itself
 
00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
generating the energy has no cost um and
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
it also has no impact on uh you know the
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
pollutants going in into the uh
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
atmosphere that are really causing all
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
of this effort to try and transition our
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
Energy System so H how do you conclude
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
or where did you come up with the
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
conclusion that there would be no
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
benefit if clean energy or clean power
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
is being generated and put onto the grid
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
because I think everybody that takes
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
stuff off the grid would end up
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
benefiting um in multiple ways
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative it's a excellent question
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
I really really like this question so I
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
said on the SE Board of selectman for 15
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
years you know until 20123 and every
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
year we negotiated with the power plant
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh for their tax dollar for many many
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
years so the power plant in our our you
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
know we are the host community and uh
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
the power plant does not except for the
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
taxes for the you know um uh for the
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
town of sebr
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
they give uh some money to State
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
education beside that this committee
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
trying for many many years to bring the
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
our energy cost lower we don't see those
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
power in New Hampshire they go somewhere
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
else we don't get a dime out of that
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
thing in New
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire many of you are here is
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
Engineers you know that I am not an
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
engineer you know we have lot of
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
different things but from from sebr
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
power plant they're good people they are
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
good company they are involved in our
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
community development and many many good
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
things they do but we're not getting any
 
00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
benefit out of that except for the tax
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
dollar so the same thing is going to
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
happen to the windmill they will build
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
it they will disrupt our Coastline and
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
then they they will take the you know
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
the line to somewhere else and they will

waiting for the right speaker to ask the
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
question about point three which is
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
moving the grid modernization advisory
 
00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:52.519 align:start position:0%
Council and the hydrogen advisory
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
Council into the office of energy
 
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
Innovation I know I served uh for four
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
years on the Energy Efficiency and
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy board and that was
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
also moved into the doe and what that
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
served to do was remove the transparency
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
remove the public uh input um the the
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
you know the meetings were no longer
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
public they were they were inter
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
Department agency meetings so could you
 
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
respond to how the grid modernization
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
Council what changes will occur if it's
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
no longer a a separate standing body in
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
terms of public meetings and all that
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know at this time if there
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
would be any specific changes uh I it
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
would just move it under this office in
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
particular so followup followup so would
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
the meetings be public and would the
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
public be able to observe the meetings
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
which is part of what we were doing when
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
we created The Advisory Council um I'm
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
not entirely familiar with how that
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
group has been working so I would just
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
have to look into that and I can get
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
you representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
you chair um thank you for being here
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
and um I heard your response that
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal impact um to this bill
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any fiscal note um but
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
could you tell me how many employees
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
would be impacted and or lose their jobs
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
if we did away with this office um
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
because you're still retaining the
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
office of energy Innovation uh right now
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
it has there's two employees with that a
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
director and an analyst and those would
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%

just some comments on House Bill
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%

00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
important a variety of important venues
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%

00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
committee is particularly Troublesome as
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
it short circuits important efforts in
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
helping to provide a path to growing
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%

vote in expedient to legislate on this
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
legislation I do want to make a couple
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
of points it's not quite accurate to say
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
that nothing is happening in offshore
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
wind uh Vineyard wind recently completed
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
the installation of its 602nd monopile
 
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
so those monopiles are the structure in
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
which the wind turbines rest so as a
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
reminder Vineyard wind which is up and
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
running and providing power to the the
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
grid uh when completed uh this year will
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
provide 800 megawatt of power to of of
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
generation of power of 400,000 homes
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
also in the Gulf of Maine I think the
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
committee is aware that there were
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
successful auctions of four of eight uh
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
lease areas wind energy areas in the
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine at the end of
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
October and two uh uh developers uh were
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
successful in those auctions and those
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
contracts have been fully executed so
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
not withstanding the recent executive
 
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
order from the Trump Administration
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
which as a
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
reminder does put a halt to Future
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
projects but does not affect projects
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
that have been permitted or under
 
00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
construction um those wind energy areas
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
and those contracts as I mentioned fully
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
executed um by early
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
January um those projects can move
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
forward um there's a lot of work to do
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
then we're talking about you know a
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
fairly long
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh time Horizon of development um but
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
that particular situation in the Gulf of
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
Maine which we can take advantage of in
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
a variety of ways certainly supply chain
 
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:44.839 align:start position:0%
job creation um uh is an opportunity one
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
final point I just don't see the
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
necessity to completely remove ourselves
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
as a state from the discussion around
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
offshore wind which is what this bill
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
does and I think it's very unfortunate
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
view okay thank you for your testimony
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
and um so we have is it true that we
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
have two handouts from your organization
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
okay there was a lot going around I want
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure we got the right
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGee representative
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
McGee has a question thank you it's I'm
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
I'm rearing a go this morning how are
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
you nice to see you um so my question is
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
around uh we talk a lot in this
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh we have shorthand for uh
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
policies we like and we talk a lot about
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
an all of the above strategy um we heard
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
from the prime sponsor that there was a
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
concern around being able to back up
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
this kind of generation and in the
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
interim I went on to the iso New England
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
website because I couldn't remember when
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
they presented to us how much is in the
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
queue right now for battery storage and
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
backup and it's uh I have an article
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
right here that says it's uh there's 18
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
,000 megawatt of battery resources in
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
the queue and I think he was talking in
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
gigawatts in terms of the need so since
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
you've been on this advisory do you have
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
any information around the planning
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's going on regionally in terms of
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh satisfying the intermittence because
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
50% is a pretty high capacity Factor as
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
these things go but um is there a need
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
to to fill the other 50% like I I'm not
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure um that's clear or if that's even a
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
point well to be clear representative I
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
don't serve on these uh commissions I
 
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
certainly attend the meetings and we're
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
supportive um I think I would defer your
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
specific question but I think the point
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
remains that um we will need more power
 
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
certainly uh as we Electrify our economy
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll see what happens with data
 
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
centers in the
 
00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:58.839 align:start position:0%
region uh we need more energy and my
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
question is where is that coming from
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
and again I don't see any reason to
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
completely separate ourselves from these
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
does additional questions representative
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
PL uh thank you chair and thank you Mr
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
Warner for coming um it was mentioned in
 
00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
testimony there's one prototype in Maine
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
is that one of the two you were
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
referring to here the cont no the um
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau of ocean Energy Management which
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
is uh under the department of interior
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
US Department of interior uh conducted a
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
long process of public uh input and wind
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
energy areas and you know the way you
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
start is with a very large area in the
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine and then you constrict con
 
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
constrict down so at the end of the day
 
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
there were eight uh wind energy areas
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
four of those were up for auction at the
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
end of October uh which were successful
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
so that's what I was referring to and
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
the fact that two
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
developers uh were successful in those
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
auctions and now have the right to
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
develop those wind energy areas with
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
resources so I have a quick question for
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
you the bill on
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
14 states that the office of energy
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
Innovation shall support the work of the
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire member of the
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental renewable energy task
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
force administered by the federal bureau
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
of ocean Energy Management bom and it
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
further States on page two
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
lines four and five that uh the office
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
will advise the Governor State agencies
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and the
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
legislature on the development of clean
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
energy resources in the Gulf of M and
 
00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.670 align:start position:0%
energy resources in the Gulf of M and
purchase

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
power and the purchase of Power by New
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Utilities for these
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
resources MH so doesn't that indicate
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the office of energy Innovation
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
will still be interested in offshore
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
wind I think at to some level but I
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
really do think that our future requires
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
a more focused approach and I have a
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
particular interest in Workforce
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
Development I think that's very
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
important I think that's uh something
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
that uh states around us certainly are
 
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
investing in I take your point uh Mr
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
chairman but I do think that we benefit
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
from a more
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
focused um aspect of concentration on
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
offshore wind thank you representative
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
rolds has a
 
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
you rob for being here can you um just
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
Enlighten the
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
committee regarding the leases the
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
successful leases that you just Al about
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
that have happened in Maine are those uh
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
have those taken place pursuant to a
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreement with any New
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
England utility or is that activity
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's happening in Maine still purely
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
guess Market private Market based
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
because the it's developers that see you
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
know potential in in in successful you
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer that question it's
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
out the outside the purview of what this
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
bill is uh addressing I take your point
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
but you know just so you know the two of
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
the four lease areas are closer to the
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
cape rather than to
 
00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.069 align:start position:0%
cape rather than to
Maine

00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
anyway okay uh representative Wendy
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you chair
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
um again piggybacking on what the chair
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
asked about the renewable energy task
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
force although they still may be
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
interested in the discussions don't
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
lines 15 through
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
29 on page one and including line one on
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
page two essentially nter that task
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
force by removing all of their analysis
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
tools I think that's a concern and
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's uh again to my point that I
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
believe that this legislature previous
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
legislature had made the decision and
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
made investment to some level of these
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
discussions and I think these venues are
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
important and ought to continue in my
 
00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:28.950 align:start position:0%
important and ought to continue in my
view

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank okay seeing no further questions I
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Mr wner for being here
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
and next call on Sarah
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
Thorne from holderness who is
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
representing herself Miss Thorne you
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
seconds good morning thank you for the
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you this
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
morning um I am a retired school teacher
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
and although I am representing myself
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
today um I I call upon you to imagine
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
these seats and classrooms across the
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
state full of young people who are
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
counting on
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
you for their future you have a big
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility you have a responsibility
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
to plan for Energy Futures for our state
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
that will bring clean air that that will
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
bring energy sources that will halt the
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
pollution of our atmosphere by methane
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
and carbon
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
dioxide which are as you all know
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
causing grave grave threats already in
 
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
causing grave grave threats already in
our

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
world um these young people are counting
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
on you to investigate every possible
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
Avenue and I would remind you that the
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
subsidies already invested in fossil
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
fuels every year amount to billions of
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
dollars hundreds of billions of dollars
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
in the United States alone and the
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
international monetary fund estimate 7
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
billion globally in
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
2022 this is wind is a new technology
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
there are bound to be glitches and we've
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
seen some of them in the past few years
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
but if you think about any bold new
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
energy technology they have all gone
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
through periods of
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
glitches and I would ask you to stay
 
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.910 align:start position:0%
glitches and I would ask you to stay
with

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:46.839 align:start position:0%
wind give it your best shot it's a
 
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
tremendously powerful potential energy
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
source for our
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
region um I sympathize with the
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative from Seabrook and his
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about Coastal impacts but I
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
would remind you to weigh that against
 
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:06.510 align:start position:0%
the impact of
 
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.589 align:start position:0%
the impact of
[Music]

00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
submerging the coastal infrastructure
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
and communities as our sea levels rise
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
and killing many many marine organisms
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
as our ocean continues to acidify
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
because of the CO2 we're putting into
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
time thank you I appreciate
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
it seeing no questions we'll move next
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
to Mr Eric Anderson from
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Mr Anderson you have two and
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.990 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman in the
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Eric Anderson
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
I've been an active commerci fisherman
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
in state of New Hampshire for over 50
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
years um there's there's components to
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
this particular bill um and one of them
 
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
that I have some knowledge about is the
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
offshore and Port development commission
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
um I've
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
attended and another colleague here Jim
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
tatone have attended every meeting over
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
the last two years and um that committee
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
or commission more or less um the
 
00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
agendas were
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
all tended to follow you know pro pro a
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
pro-wind approach um in the course of
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
two years and I sat there as an
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
interested party for the fishing
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
industry we had maybe 40 minutes of
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
dialogue in that commission over two
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
years and I thought that was
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
insufficient um but I did and and it
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
explored many aspect of of offshore wi
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I found most
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
interesting was um somebody that they
 
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
they solicited at one of the agendas and
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
this fow represented a company that
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
repairs the cables for offshore wind if
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
they fail he's built a business I mean
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a solid business he
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
says without a doubt these cables are
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
going to fail and I'm the guy that comes
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
in and fixes
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
him he explained that it's a
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar venture to fix
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
these things and it takes over 20 days
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 days to fix these so when they
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
fail that power that's you know the
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
transmission lines that are coming to
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
shore I'm not sure what exactly where
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
that power goes but that's that was one
 
00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
thing I found it in interesting you know
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
to to hear him speak about what his
 
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
business does
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
um that's that's the the extent of you
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
know my
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
um of of attending the meetings at the
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
at the port at the um offshore ort
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
development commission and um I I
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
support that it really has explored
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
everything it doesn't really have much
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
of a function anymore thank you thank
 
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
Anderson perfect timing by the way
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions I'll thank you and
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
I'll call next on
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
Ward and I'm not sure what Ward's last
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
name is um it's kind of hard to read
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
Bak that would be
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
burn oh burn okay um I'm a I'm a lefty
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I I can't write very good I guess
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's what they tell me no problem but
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here I'm uh thank you
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
for uh having me this morning for this
 
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh testimony uh my name is Ward burn I'm
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
a commercial Fisher out of Portsmouth
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I own the vessel fishing
 
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
vessel sugar
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
daddy um I've heard a lot of interesting
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
feedback this morning and I'd like to uh
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
not many people know I well I was on the
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
on the Wind commission and uh I became a
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
student of of wind energy I dug into
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
every little dirty secret there is about
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
wind energy and um not many people truly
 
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
know the definition of green energy like
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
what is green energy does you know
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
anybody really know you know we talk
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
about green energy and how great it is
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
but do we know what it
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
means and I so I Googled the definition
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
of green energy is an energy that can be
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
produced using a method or form or
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
source that can cause no harm to its
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
natural environment and I read that to
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
you because there's a lot of bad things
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
that take place with windmills and I I'm
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
sure a lot of you haven't heard of the
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
cooling stations that are required for
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
these experimental wind farms these
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
cooling stations are going to take
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
seawater off the ocean floor they're
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
going to suck suck the water into the
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
units they're going to cool and the
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
reason they cool is because they need to
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
transfer from AC to DC power and it
 
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.510 align:start position:0%
transfer from AC to DC power and it
creates

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
creates
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
heat they chlorinate it to prevent
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
fowling in their equipment when they
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
discharge it they're going to discharge
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
that water at the tune of 8.2 million
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
gallons a day at 40% load into the ocean
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
chlorinated heated sea water if they get
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
this wind array that they would like
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
that would be 280 million gallons of
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
chlorinated sea water into our ocean
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
your ocean my ocean our kids
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
oceans it it would it's an O it's an
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
ocean killer absolutely 100% this is
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
their data this is from from the wind
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
companies their material I didn't make
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
this up at a 100% load that's 333
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
million gallons of chlorinated heated
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
heated sea waterer into the ocean it's
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
it will destroy and kill our ocean there
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
are no greater stewards of the Ocean
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
than fishermen
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves I'm deeply concerned about the
 
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
death of whales hundreds of whales are
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
washed ashore because of these windmills
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
no one will put a finger on it because
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
they've been bought out if you look into
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
research New England Aquarium a big
 
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
whale saer they received 1.5 million
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
from the wind companies everybody's been
 
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
hush on this issue and it's absolutely
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
ridiculous we're held to a standard to
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
protect whales and we and we do the very
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
best we can yet these these foreign
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
companies have no standards they've
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
actually been alloted a number from
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
Noah on how many whales they can kill if
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
we did that we're out of
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
business um there's another thing that
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
is on these windmills we always see
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
these dumps that they put the windmill
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
blades in there's a reason for that wrap
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
it up quickly please I'm working on it I
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
I could talk for an hour on this but uh
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
the compound that's on the windmill
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
blades is a compound called banol a it's
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
a a resin that's in it and the reason
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
they have these windmill dumps is the
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
blades become brittle and the outer
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
coating breaks off and becomes into
 
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
particles and falls into the ocean or it
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
will fall into the ocean after 2 years
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
the forage fish will eat those particles
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
and then the forage fish will be eaten
 
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:32.799 align:start position:0%
by the Predator fish and they will
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
toxify our food and I and in my closing
 
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
I'd like you to think that the banol a
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
is highly toxic we think of all the
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
windmills that are in our country right
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
now and the crazy Rising rate of of
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
Cancer all these windmills are
 
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:51.559 align:start position:0%
experiencing the same thing this stuff
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
is breaking off going into our ground
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
and toxifying our drinking water it's
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
something think about this windmills are
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
anything but green thank
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you representative Vice
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas has a question for you
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my my question is
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to Federal bureaucrats and
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
windmill companies how well do you think
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
fishermen that fish in the Gulf of Maine
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
know their Waters and know what affects
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
their Waters and the fishing population
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's our backyard it's our front yard
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
Nobody Knows the ocean better than us we
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
know where the species are what time the
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
year they're there what tide they're
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
there it's it's it's our where we make
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
our living and we care deeply nobody
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
cares about these oceans more than us
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
and I I particularly care is I have a
 
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
son that's also a commercial fisherman I
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
have a lot invested into this to protect
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
our futures and for our kids we kill the
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
ocean it's over and these windmills I am
 
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
100% convinced are ocean killers and
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
overlooked uh representative schneller
 
00:54:09.549 --> 00:54:09.559 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
question I one thing you didn't mention
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
because your time was limited I assume
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the super high uh
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
quality I guess the word is axle grease
 
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
that's used to continue to run these
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
wind turbines offshore that
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh is designed to not leech into the
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
ocean in your research and experience
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
does that actually leech into the ocean
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
and affect potentially what you
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
do well certainly any any oil leak into
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
the ocean is not good I know they they
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
house a tremendous amount of hydraulic
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
fluid I don't know specifically on the
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
grease on them but they they do have
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
large quantities of oil that that are in
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
it and and keep in mind the carbon
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
footprint it takes to build these things
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
is is extraordinary for for them to
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
install them the diesel fuel that's
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
burnt the discharge from Builders it's
 
00:55:04.359 --> 00:55:06.870 align:start position:0%
burnt the discharge from Builders it's
it's

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
significant okay seeing no further
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you for being
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
here we have four more people who want
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill so that is an
 
00:55:17.549 --> 00:55:17.559 align:start position:0%
alert to the people who are here for
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
575 that we should be able to start on
 
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
that bill in about 10 to 12 minutes so
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
next up is J Julie Porter of
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
Dover Miss Porter you have two and a
 
00:55:32.039 --> 00:55:39.470 align:start position:0%
Dover Miss Porter you have two and a
half

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
minutes good
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
morning please press the button to turn
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
mic hello
 
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
okay there's not enough time we've been
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
going over this for years so I'm going
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
to try to make it as quick as I can and
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
cover as much as I can um P ISO up this
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
morning or yesterday sorry um gas is at
 
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
55% these this is what's powering New
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
England right now nuclear is at 24
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
Renewables at 12 so you break down the
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
Renewables solar is at 4% wind is at
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
three I I I'm going to jump around a
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
little bit because this is important
 
00:56:18.599 --> 00:56:19.710 align:start position:0%
little bit because this is important
this

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
3% because that's all New Jersey is
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
generating and they have the most
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
offshore wind off the coast of New
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
3.9 so I'm I'm really really
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
wondering the point of all this exercise
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
wind and solar are
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
not steady sources of heat I live in a
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
solar house I know a passive solar
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
house okay let's talk about the cabling
 
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
I got to cover a lot of things I get
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
back to my farm so I'm going to cover
 
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:52.839 align:start position:0%
try to cover everything of all the bills
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
that I can sorry the cabling the pascao
 
00:56:59.230 --> 00:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
toilla station um the pipe 50 years ago
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
we fought off a pipeline going to go up
 
00:57:00.839 --> 00:57:01.589 align:start position:0%
we fought off a pipeline going to go up
the

00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:04.039 align:start position:0%
bay well this is even worse because
 
00:57:06.029 --> 00:57:06.039 align:start position:0%
after they get the pipeline to Schiller
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be dealing with cabling
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
that carries emps which is very
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
dangerous for any anybody people and
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
animals in the
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
bay battery storage right now there's a
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
battery storage facility burning this is
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
the third one this is the second um one
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
in this particular one in Monterey Bay
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
Monterey Bay is now a Hazmat site
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
because of the battery
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
storage wind turbines and land we really
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
need to address these because they're
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
just as bad um another Hazmat problem if
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
they burn they make the area around them
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
unfarmable there's two farms in New York
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
that right now are dealing with this
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to farm their land
 
00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.670 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to farm their land
probably

00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
ever win turbines and Wildlife our own

New Hampshire fishing game website
 
00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%

00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
the way which are sort of in a
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
precarious place right now wi en jne any
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
facilities whose turbines can either
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
indirectly or directly kill large

own New Hampshire fishing game site
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
these things are death there there's no
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
green about them and there's there's
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
nothing that we're gaining from them so
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
I I I failed to see the
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
point reindeer and lap land oh I'm sorry
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
gosh reindeer and lap land won't go near
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
these things one final thought please
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
one final thought oh my gosh okay dead
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
citations three of us have been
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
following the dead citations P floating
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
up on the shore where wind wind is
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
being surveyed and running and as of the
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
end of December the count for cations is
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
293 and those are the ones we know about
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
these aren't the ones that are floating
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
out there that we never see or at the
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
bottom of the ocean they're not ship
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
strikes they're not fishing lines
 
00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
they're bleeding from their ears and if
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
you want to look up a study the new H um
 
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
you our own US Navy was sued three times
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
for inflicting brain Heming on citations
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
we know this is causing it it it's not
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
just an accident that these animals are
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
washing up on shore and this is very
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
important because do we really want this
 
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire do we really want
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
animals do we really want to kill our
 
00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
fishing industry half 90% of our fish is
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
coming from other countries do you think
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
Indonesia cares about the shrimp they're
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
getting for us
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
these guys care because this is where
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
they live these
 
00:59:30.039 --> 00:59:32.390 align:start position:0%
they live these
fishermen

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
fishermen
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
so questions okay thank you questions
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
for Miss border I'm happy to send this
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
citation list because it has links

pictures the whole thing yes if you have
 
00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:45.160 align:start position:0%

committee I'm representative Matt Sabor
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
D Schwaner from SE Brook I want to Echo
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
a similar sentiments that we've
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
expressed so far this morning I uh
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
support this bill and the other offshore
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
wind bills that are here today I I don't
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
believe offshore wind should be
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
considered for a few reasons uh we have
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
a 400-year fishing industry on the New
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sea coasts including seab
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
Brook as well uh these offshore wind
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
leases are occurring right in the middle
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
of all of our fishermen's uh trade
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
routes uh we need them to be able to
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
fish and bring bring food home to their
 
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
families and to us as well it's a it's a
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
food security additionally I'd like to
 
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
point out that uh the commercial leases
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
that are happening in the the Gulf of
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
Maine right now um those are being
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
opened up at the exact same time as the
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
research lease so the research lease
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's off the coast of Maine isn't you
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
know they're not they should finish the
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
research first before going into you
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
know commercial leasing when the Air
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
Force wants to get a new aircraft that
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
goes through research and development
 
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
and operational test and evaluation
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
before you know being actually deployed
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
to the fleet and same thing here with uh
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
with our commercial fishing um want to
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
point out too this past summer there was
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh a blade that broke off the coast of
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
ncka Massachusetts the shrapnel from the
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
blade uh was everywhere over the beaches
 
01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:41.039 align:start position:0%
and it shut the beaches down for the
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
summertime now I'm from seab Brook but I
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
know that Hampton Northampton Rye
 
01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
Portsmith these are all commercial
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
vacation towns that if something like
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
that were to happen right now in the in
 
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
the middle of summertime that would
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
um it's not something we could afford on
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast um I just wanted to be S I
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
questions okay
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we want to thank
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
you and we'll move on to the next fol
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
next person who would like to testify
 
01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
this morning that's CIA Kelly from
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
welcome Miss Kelly

yeah thank you Mr chairman my name is CH
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
Kelly from Hook New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
originally from uh Vietnam the communist
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
country and I'm here to testify that I'm
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
a republican but I went to all these uh
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
windmills meeting for the last two years
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't see much of our um Democrat
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
friends that always Champion for you
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
know animal rights and all that good
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
stuff and I'm a vegetarian myself for 13
 
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
14 years so I deeply care for all the
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
creatures and from all these meetings I
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
gather all the baby fish and all other
 
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
the ocean creatures going to be sucked
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
into these machine when they run and
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
there won't be any baby to grow up for
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
us to harvest for other people that have
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
the need for
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
seafood and so that's affect our food
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
security and also the parameter
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
parameter that all these structure going
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
to be built in the ocean got on so limit
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
where the people going to be able to
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
fish or recreational purposes and one
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
last important thing that I would like
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
to mention that most of us in the US
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
won't know is that China is in control
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
of South China Sea and they had the
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
capability of build the whole Tel into
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
Vietnam and all these other regions so
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
that they can move military underground
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
and from all these meetings these
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
company that capable of building these
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
things in the out ocean floor if this
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
pass is they all foreign company it's
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
not us company so we have no control
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
who's in our ocean floor and God forbid
 
01:04:14.589 --> 01:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
if there's a World War 3 breaking out
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
they blocking our entrance into our
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
region we going to be doomed doesn't
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
matter what party of we are from so I'm
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
here to support this bill to please get
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
rid rid of this wind thing because it's
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
not green it kill a lot of sea creatures
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
and ocean creatures and that's cruel and
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
that is something we want to teach our
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
children in school that we care not just
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
for the human being we care for all
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
creature that we coexisting together
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so much okay thank
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
you see no questions I'll turn the floor
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
over to the last presenter on this bill
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
and that's John Gage of Windam Mr Gage
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
seconds thank you chairman Vose and
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
committee for taking my testimony today
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
um so I want to start off with a thank
 
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:21.799 align:start position:0%
you chairman Vose for agreeing to invite
 
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
the state climatologist to an
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
informational hearing to your committee
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm here today because I'm worried
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
about global warming and I hope
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
everybody will go to nasa. climate.gov
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
um to learn about the scientific
 
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
consensus about a pollution problem we
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
have um we do need a diverse energy
 
01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
Supply um and wind offshore wind has a
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
lot of local benefits as the New
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State coordinator of citizens
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
climate Lobby I lobed Congress for the
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
ryy ACT uh last fall um this is to to
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
use Revenue sh sharing for offshore wind
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
generators uh to help the local
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
communities um with the rising Seas as
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
well as the industrial impact of uh any
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
energy development no
 
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
energy Supply and no energy source is
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
without problems um wind certainly has
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
some e environmental problems um but
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
comparing that to the environmental
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
problems we suffer from fossil fuels um
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
um if you're worried about warming water
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
uh We've added so much greenhouse gas um
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the air that there's two watts per
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
meter of warming across the whole
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
surface of the Earth this is warming the
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
oceans way more than some cooling of
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
wind turbines could ever manage um
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
remember you're here to talk about House
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
Bill 682 so 682 I think is part of a
 
01:06:58.589 --> 01:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
three bill um war on wind power that is
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
um that we're talking about today uh
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
wind power is one we we use what 2% of
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
our energy comes from wind the
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
Netherland gets 24% of its power from
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
wind how do they do that well they only
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
use 38% uh gas power are they more
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
Innovative than us no they do things
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
like generate hydrogen with the extra
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
power that comes from wind that they can
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
then use to generate electricity during
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
that down times um there's local jobs at
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
stake it takes a long time to deploy
 
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and our our other states
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
are investing in that now and I think we
 
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
need to continue um what was decided
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
last year uh to make an investment uh
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
for Workforce training and to prepare
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you for your
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
testimony see no questions I'm going to
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
682 and we will immediately open a
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
575

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
575
 
01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:11.799 align:start position:0%
dfn and if she is here I will call
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
Representative Kelly Penza to introduce
 
01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.630 align:start position:0%
Representative Kelly Penza to introduce
this

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and M Penza I need a pink
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
you have five minutes to introduce this
 
01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and for the
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative uh
 
01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
Kelly Penza straford District 19
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh Rochester Wards 1 2 3 4 and
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
six um I filed this bill because I've
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
been following this subject for the last
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
couple years and have um been literally
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
out of my mind um with the level of no
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
information disinformation covered up
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
the truth in regards with all of this um
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
no one seems to be listening there's you
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
know our mainstream media hasn't um
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't really covered all of the harms
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
um you know the horrible disaster of
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
course that took place in
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
Nantucket uh did definitely um pull back
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
the curtain on this industry but now um
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
now it's even more um now it's even more
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
at the Forefront I just wanted to first
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
start off my testimony with um the
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
basically we have an executive order
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
right now so it's temporary withdrawal
 
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
of all areas on the outer continental
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%

01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%

wind projects the Gulf of main project
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
that is owned by federal waters this um
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
executive action uh emergency order uh
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
takes place so you know thank God for
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
the administration doing
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
that so one the reason why we ban this
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is environment m al in
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
Wildlife protection offshore wind
 
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
projects threaten and kill and are
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
killing marine life Wheels Dolphins fish
 
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
populations bottom dwellers and so on
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
through noise pollution habitat
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
destruction and increased vessel traffic
 
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
studies suggest offer winds wind farms
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
are dis um are actually disrupting
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
migratory bird patterms they lead to
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
higher bird fatalities uh the underwater
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
noise and electromatic fields from
 
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
cables interfere with marine species
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
navigation and breed and breeding
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
um literally they are just disoriented
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
and look and can drive uh um swim
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
themselves right into boats and all of
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
that but the most important thing which
 
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
um a previous testimony was talked about
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
was literally dumping millions of
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
gallons of toxic chlorine bleach into
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
the ocean that is absolutely pure
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
Insanity economic and job impacts
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
offshore wind is heavily riing on
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
government subsidies uh it's placing
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
financial burden on taxpayers without
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
guaranteed long-term economic benefits
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's clear it doesn't produce anything
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
what we need it to produce for it to be
 
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
of value it's pretty much all harm
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
Coastal communities depend on tourism um
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
and unsightly offshore wind farms of
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
course can negatively impact property
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
values and visitor rates but it's really
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
not about the look and feel it's about
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
if we're going to destroy our entire Sea
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
Coast in New
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh fishing industries suffer
 
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
from restricted access Trad traditional
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
fishing areas reducing local jobs in
 
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
food supply chains I will provide this
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee with my testimony and then the
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
testimony of the fishermen in
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because they have dredged
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
those cables all along the bottom of the
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
ocean and they are destroying muscles
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
harvesting National Security risks
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
offshore wind farms interfere with the
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
military radar surveillan systems and
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
Naval operations potentially
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
compromising National Security if
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
something happens if that Gulf if that
 
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
Gulf of um Gulf of main projects goes on
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
which by the way they are not dredging
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
they are floating cables never been done
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
before um and someone let's say for
 
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
example a fisherman is out there uh and
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
they're caught anywhere near that we
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
can't even have our Naval come in there
 
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
and and help them huge security
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
issue um there's cyber security concerns
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
regarding foreign made wind bines
 
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
particularly those manufactured by of
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
course adversarial
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
Nations and energy and reliability cost
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
concerns when when energy is
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
intermittent unreliable requiring backup
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
energy sources often fossil fuels
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
undermining its environmental benefits
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
offshore wind is significantly more
 
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
expensive than other energy options with
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance cost Skyrock due to harsh
 
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.430 align:start position:0%

Marine
 
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
conditions and of course Energy prices
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
may rise due to the high cost of
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
building and M maintaining offshore wind
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
farms there are a lot of alternate
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
Energy Solutions as you this committee
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
well knows instead of offshore wind
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
Investments should be directed toward
 
01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
more stable and less harmful Energy
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
Solutions such as nuclear power
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
geothermal energy and advancements in
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
energy storage as well as
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
Hydro onshore wind and solar is non in
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
non-sensitive areas um can provide
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
renewable energy without disrupting
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
marine life in coastal economies but
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
that still is even up for debate at this
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
it excellent questions for the
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative representative Swanson
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative Penza uh I I've never
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
heard of the thing about uh the
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
windmills offshore wind dumping chlorine
 
01:14:26.189 --> 01:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
bleach into oceans is that what you said
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
can you provide a source or reference
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
for that the previous the previous um
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
speaker the fisherman told you that it's
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
all in their documents through Bal and
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
um no OAA I'll provide you that that's
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
how they he's explained how they clean
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
out the cooling systems I I'm looking
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
for a reference like a technical
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
document okay I'll provide that thank
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
question oh sor thank you Mr chair um
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for being here
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
um on page two of this bill you talk
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
about fines $50,000 fines for each day
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
actually um
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor misdemeanors and felonies um
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
my question is how did you come up with
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
these penalties and what's what are the
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
specific charges that you're you're uh
 
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
specific charges that you're you're uh
implying

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
here okay um I can point you to uh line
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
page two line uh
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
two uh line 11 and line
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
13 so once the if this bill passes
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
anyone that is proceeding to um move
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
forward with this this is a um a
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
multi-trillion dollar industry so um
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
nationally and and actually really
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
globally so I think that they could
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
afford that amount I worked with OS on
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
it and that's what we came up with for
 
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
people that are going to violate um
 
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
moving forward on something that is
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
against state law follow up follow up
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um and I um am very interested
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
in lines 14 and 15 on page two that says
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
if illegal offshore wind activities have
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
caused environmental harm or disruption
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
The Violator shall be held financially
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
responsible and required to restore the
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
affected area or take corrective action
 
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
did you confer with Dees and if so what
 
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
is the specific methodology because
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get a company in marac
 
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
to clean up after their mess and we're
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
not having great
 
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
success well because there is no
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
offshore wind activity currently um that
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
is that's just there basically if
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
somebody moves forward or if it moved
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
forward um so I want that in there just
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
because it's we're not going to be able
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
to get into specifics at this point um
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
I've done a lot with this bill at this
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
point which was I think um what we could
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
do at this time um it's just basically
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
saying that they would be held
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
financially responsible so for example
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
let's say the we'll use Nantucket as an
 
01:17:14.669 --> 01:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
example that if that's causing uh the
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
city or the town of Nantucket you know
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars for the cleanup and
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
all of that that the offshore wind
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
company would be held responsible for
 
01:17:27.629 --> 01:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
up further questions representative
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
one thank you chairman
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh you uh indicated uh their are
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
National Security risks and that
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
potentially the Navy cannot assist a uh
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
someone who is uh in trouble near the
 
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
near a windmill yeah the Coast Guard so
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay the Coast Guard not the Navy
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
yes um and is is this also uh is it your
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that that the cable areas
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
and the windmills areas would be uh
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
foreclosed for Naval uh uh Transit and
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
potentially you know submarines would
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
also be foreclosed from uh certain areas
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
there yes they would because it's
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
floating and those are still moving and
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have we have nothing to base it
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
on at this point cuz the ones that there
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
um have not been used and just if you
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
think about weather alone uh hurricane
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
bad weather we it's just it's crazy to
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
think that we'd be putting floating
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
cables in a place that could be so
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
volatile for different weather patterns
 
01:18:44.669 --> 01:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative R answer a
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Penza you your testimony
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
consist consisted of a lot of
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
citation of the many dangers and horrors
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
of potential um offshore wind I just
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
wondering have you ever visited Block
 
01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
Island and seen the 11 existing wind
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
turbines that are within sight off the
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
coast of that summer vacation Hot Spot
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
no I have not but I've visited Virginia
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
where they are um installing offshore
 
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
wind I lived in Chesapeake for a couple
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
years my girlfriend lives on Virginia
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
Beach um and they are the people are
 
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
trying to fight it there but it is
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
unbelievable what they are doing there's
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
our dredging because of course there's
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
our um you know pylon into the ocean
 
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
floor which that parsus alone um
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
destroys Wildlife it the sound all of
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
that so so but no I haven't been to what
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I've been to
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
Virginia though thank
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee has a question
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you representative
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
Penza for taking my question um you
 
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
testified that that the flo the proposal
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
for floating in uh the Gulf of main
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
floating floating uh wind turbines is
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
untested and hasn't been done before are
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
you familiar with high wind in Scotland
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
because there is a there is a project
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
where they're using
 
01:20:21.629 --> 01:20:21.639 align:start position:0%
floating um wind turbines no I'm not
 
01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
familiar but I'm I'm talking about the
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
United States not not Scotland and if
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
you look kind of what's going on with
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
internationally they're shutting down
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
all of their wi projects too as well
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much I don't think Scotland is so
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't want I don't know about
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
Scotland but I know most of them are
 
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
getting shut down yeah and we have an
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
executive order that says no more wind
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
so I think we should follow it in New
 
01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay seeing no more questions
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
we'll move on whoops there is another
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
Swanson so uh thank you Mr Mr chair uh
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh just uh
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
little further clarification uh I think
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned some uh national security
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
issue or whatever but my understanding
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
is that any offshore wind would have to
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
be be permitted by the federal
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
government and there would be a thorough
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh vetting process and cost benefit
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
analysis and uh are you saying that the
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
federal government would permit
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
something that would be deleterious to
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
our defense
 
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
yes I am um the previous administration
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
I believe yeah and this been going on
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
for a long time so this isn't a a
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
partisan thing um there was a lot of
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
people that really weren't paying
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
attention and under big huge thousand
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
page bills under the the guise of green
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
energy which I'm all for protecting the
 
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
environment I'm on environment and
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture I do it all the time so that
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
I don't have any problem with that the
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
reason why an executive order has just
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
been put in place
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
whatever the date of that was um a week
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
and a half ago or so is because of the
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
damage that they're causing and there
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't been enough due diligence we are
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the other rep uh the other
 
01:22:11.629 --> 01:22:11.639 align:start position:0%
person that spoke the amount of money
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
that are pouring into these um
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and all of that that would
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
have be hard against this are turning a
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
blind eye because they're taking in
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars and um and yeah and
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
everything that we're doing here in New
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Banning past poos all of that
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff none of these are none of
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
these are good for the environment and
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
then just where we would even put these
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
blades just like the same thing that we
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
have problems with solar panels in you
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
know you can't recycle all of them in
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
the toxic you know chemicals that come
 
01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
from it so there hasn't been a lot of
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
things that are thought out um there's
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
been a lot of money that's gone around
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're in this this mess
 
01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
that we're in thank you represent and
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr God uh representative Wendy
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
Thomas before you ask your question I
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
just remind you that we have 15 pink
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
cards of people who want to testify on
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
this bill um thank you Mr chair just a
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
clarification on this bill um and
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative I really respect your
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
your Devotion to the environment and
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
your your will to protect um our our
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
oceans and our land um but I'm a little
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
confused about what appears to be the
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
second part of this bill which is to um
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
establish a renewable energy fund can
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
you can you just walk me through that
 
01:23:34.679 --> 01:23:36.510 align:start position:0%
you can you just walk me through that
that

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
part where is that it starts uh page two
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
it starts down at line um uh
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
189 or actually
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
19 none of that is 24th starts on 24th
 
01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:53.639 align:start position:0%
sorry okay that's not part of my bill
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
that is already
 
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
statute oh so you're just removing okay
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
much okay seeing no further questions
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
we'll next call
 
01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.189 align:start position:0%
we'll next call
Representative

01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
Brook and representative will give you
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
two minutes 30 seconds is that
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
fair thank you chairman FKS and members
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee again representative
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
born D Schwaner from sebr um you so I
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
spoke before I'll I'll go into another
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
aspect of uh these this wind technology
 
01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
so so one thing that you can't change
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
about the wind technology even if we
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
were to actually um improve the product
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
in the future is the effect of wind on
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
the ocean the wind plumes themselves so
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
I know that they do have I know um I
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
think one of the representatives here
 
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned um a wind farm out by Scotland
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
I know that there there's already a wind
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
farm in the North Sea in in in England
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
right now and what they're experiencing
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
is sediment plumes being kicked up and
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
what does this mean for our food
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
Securities so in in our ocean food chain
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
it starts off with the phytoplankton and
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
then the zoo Plankton which feeds off
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
the phytoplankton and Then followed by
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
the fish and shellfish larve that will
 
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
you know eat the zoo Plankton um
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
phytoplankton feeds off of sunlight and
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
the sediment plumes that are kicked up
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
by the wind uh by wind tabes will
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
actually uh douse the upper it will
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
bring shade too H throw it will throw
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
shade to the upper layers of the ocean
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the very bottom of the food chain
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
relies on uh the phytoplankton um were
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
basically pulling the rug out from
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
underneath the ocean food chain just
 
01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to throw that out there for you
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
guys about some of this technology
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
so okay an important Point any questions
 
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none next we'll
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
call on representative Abul Khan to get
 
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
legislation two and a half minutes okay
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
 yeah thank
 
01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman again a member
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the board uh thank you for hearing my
 
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
testimony I am in support of this bill
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman uh coming out of the
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
campaign and our campaign is a long
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
campaign you know it starts very early
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
on we do our primary we do our regular
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
campaign and every time I went to you
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
know knocking many many people asked me
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
about these questions and um I I didn't
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
have a you know clear answer that what
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
what is going to be until um the we
 
01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
heard that executive order last week
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
thanks to the current Administration
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
that they uh doing this for our state
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know is going to get a big benefit
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
out of this Mr chairman New Hampshire
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
has only I mentioned New Hampshire has
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
only 177 miles we don't don't have 117
 
01:27:00.669 --> 01:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
miles just 17 miles and if you drop
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
those 17 miles you will see how pristine
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
it is you know you know it cannot be
 
01:27:07.629 --> 01:27:07.639 align:start position:0%
changed with anything else it's so
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
beautiful and these companies out of
 
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
state it's not even out of state out of
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
countries companies they are here to
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
destroy our way of life the way we live
 
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
here this is no good for our New
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the future generation and
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
everything the way we killed the other
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
project you know from the hydro project
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
from Canada we need to kill it the same
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
way you know for for our future
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
generation so I'm urging uh all the you
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
know the Committee Member for us please

New Hampshire and we're going to leave
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
it better than that thank you Mr
 
01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:53.960 align:start position:0%

chairman I'm ready to take any other
question

01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you questions for
 
01:27:57.639 --> 01:28:00.070 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you questions for
representative

01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
KH seeing none we'll call up next Megan
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
Stone from the Department of energy to
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.229 --> 01:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
legislation and I believe the department
 
01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
just supplied us today an updated fiscal
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
note for this bill is that
 
01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
correct um I have not seen one today but
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
I also haven't opened my computer in a
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
while so not entirely sure yes we did
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
receive one we have we have a copy up
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
here okay um so good morning again Mr
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee uh my
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
name is Megan Stone legislatively is on
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the Department of energy um the
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on House Bill 575
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
but we do have some concerns with the
 
01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
language um the bill implements SE
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
several changes that fall under the
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
Department's purview it abolishes the
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
office of offshore wind industry
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
development and energy Innovation
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
including its funding source however the
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill retains the statutory duties of the
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
Court ordinator of nuclear development
 
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
but provides no funding or Staffing to
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
support those duties it repeals the
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
offshore wind industry Workforce
 
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
Training Center committee and the
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
offshore port and development commission
 
01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
um the department has no concerns
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
regarding this section and similar
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
language is also found in um House Bill
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
682 which we heard this morning um as
 
01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
written the prohibitions in this bill
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
would make it all but impossible for the
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
Department to defend the state's
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
interests in Regional energy matters as
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
it relates to Offshore wind development
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
in the Gulf of mime if the committee
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
wishes to deemphasize the state's
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
involvement in offshore wind in the Gulf
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
of Maine while still safeguarding the
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
state's interest the department believes
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
the language contained in House Bill 682
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
from this morning um is preferable and
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
questions for the Department
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
chair um if I'm reading this right
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying uh for the fiscal note
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
that the department would save
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
$220 because an ad administrator and a
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
utility analyst would be as eliminated
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
that is correct however when I asked you
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
earlier the impact of removing the the
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
wind uh Department you said there would
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
be and I'll have to find My Notes but
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
there's a director and an analyst they
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
would not there would be no impact so
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
which which is it correct um the bill
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
this morning did not remove the entire
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
office just the offshore wind duties of
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
that office so those two positions
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
remain this Bill removes the entire
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
office so it would remove those two
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
positions with
 
01:30:31.109 --> 01:30:31.119 align:start position:0%
it thank you for that clarification
 
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
further questions Vice chair Thomas uh
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um just a comment and
 
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
uh from the previous uh representative's
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
comments for the record uh I believe I
 
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.550 align:start position:0%
comments for the record uh I believe I
heard

01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
$220 it's actually
 
01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
$220,000 yes my error thank you okay
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions for the
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
Department we'll next call on Michael
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
Lata of eversource to give us the
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
utilities perspective on this
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning Mr
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
Lata next up will be Lisa lenos good
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
morning uh Michael Lata representing
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
eversource energy I'll be brief uh
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to come and
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
testify before you today uh eversource
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
is opposed to this
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
legislation uh we know in the past the
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
committee has discussed and received
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
numerous Pres presentations on the
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
projected increases in electri
 
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
electricity usage uh regionally New
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has pursu pursued a technology
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
neutral market-based approach to its
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
energy strategy and we believe a blanket
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition as called for under this
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
bill on one technology is inconsistent
 
01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
each sorry about that uh we believe that
 
01:31:53.229 --> 01:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
each proposed project regardless of
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
Technology should be evaluated based on
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
their individual merits through a
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
thorough permitting review if projects
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
are determined to be uneconomic or have
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
unacceptable environmental impacts those
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
projects should not proceed but again we
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
do not support a blanket prohibition on
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
even considering projects such as
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and with that I'd be happy
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that I
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
can questions for Mr LC representative
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
McGee has one thank you Mr chairman
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Lata for coming here today
 
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
um we heard earlier that there's no
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
energy type that is perfect um in terms
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
of uh damage or uh Downstream
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
impacts uh I'm looking at the only
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
existing floating uh wind turbines in
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
the world I'm looking at their project
 
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
literature and I don't see anything here
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
about um bleaches being used there's a
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
section on lubricants and liquids so I I
 
01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
guess where I wanted to um what I
 
01:32:58.830 --> 01:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
noticed about this is they have a
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
decommissioning plan they have um an
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
assessment for harm to Wildlife it seems
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
like this these things can be done
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
poorly or they can be done well but um
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
my question is are we better off being
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
involved in the process so that we're
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
aware of what's going on offshore rather
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
than closing the doors and closing our
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
eyes um to not understanding what's
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
going on without our
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
participation thank you representative
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
um you know I I can't speak to any
 
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
specific project uh what I would say is
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
that if projects are developed within or
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
proposed within the uh Gulf of Maine uh
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
we believe that they should be subject
 
01:33:51.629 --> 01:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
to rigorous
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
environmental uh permitting and if the
 
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts or economic
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
impacts of those proposals are
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
unacceptable whatever technology or
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
whatever specific um uh details of those
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
projects are then they should not
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
proceed thank you thank you
 
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a quick
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so uh if you
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
accept the fact as uh representative
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington uh testified earlier this
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
morning that in order to have wind Mills
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the uh ocean we need 12 GW of backup
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
power isn't that already enough to say
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
no it's unacceptable we can't afford
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
this our view is that uh offshore wind
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
could be one component of an overall
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
resource mix and I again each individual
 
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
project should be uh evaluated on its
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
own merits and obviously there are
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
challenges as this committee is well
 
01:35:01.390 --> 01:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
aware uh from numerous presentations by
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
groups like ISO New England on future
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
growth and the resources required to um
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
to meet that so each technology has its
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
drawbacks okay seeing no further
 
01:35:21.149 --> 01:35:21.159 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank Mr Lata and
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
call next Miss Leisa Lisa
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
lenos uh who is an expert on wind and we
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
haven't seen you in a while here but
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
welcome back thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um uh for the record my
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
name is Lisa lenos I've been resident in
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and have
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
spent the last 20 years evaluating
 
01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
investigating the impacts and costs of
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
industrial scale wind energy uh for the
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
last 5 years I've been focused almost
 
01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
entirely on offshore wind working with
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
Michael shenberger whom you might know
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm fully in favor of this
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
um bill as as in favor of the bill prior
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
as well um I had three suggestions I
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to make with regard to the bill
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
the first is if HB 219f does not secure
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
sufficient support to phase out our RPS
 
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
I suggest you add language stating that
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
the offshore win is not eligible for
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
class one treatment and that way there
 
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
would be no mechanism in St statute
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
where offshore wind can be recognized by
 
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
the state and subject to our subsidies
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
second I'd encourage adding language to
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
the bill that would explicitly prohibit
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire from
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
mandating or approving utility
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
negotiated long-term power purchase
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
agreements for offshore win in this way
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rate payers will not incur
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of projects
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
um and in any way um
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
that feed into even those that feed into
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
the regional grid so if a project is
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
built offshore
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts a utility here chooses to
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
buy some of that energy albe all of it
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
has been all of it that's under
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
construction is already on contract with
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
out with other utilities we do not want
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
the cost to be borne by New Hampshire
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
rate payers and finally while I'm not
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
sure if this is possible but if a
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
project is proposed that falls within
 
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
the state's ocean view shed but is on
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
shored onto into Maine or new or
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I encourage adding
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
language that the state would discourage
 
01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:37.159 align:start position:0%
any positive consistency review under
 
01:37:37.159 --> 01:37:53.750 align:start position:0%
any positive consistency review under
RSA

01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
specific it is entirely consistent for
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
the state to establish limits on
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
Technologies it does not choose to
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
impose on the state of New Hampshire um
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
questions could you elaborate for me
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
please on your last point about a
 
01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:16.270 align:start position:0%
please on your last point about a
discouraging

01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
discouraging
 
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
viewshed I didn't quite understand what
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
you meant by that let me make that more
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
clear so right now there are no leases
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
at the Bureau of ocean Energy Management
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
has not identified any leases within the
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
Gulf of ma of Maine that are will cause
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
a wind project to be built within our
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
viewshed as far as I'm
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
aware if a project if a lease area is
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
proposed in federal waters adjacent to
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Waters what happens is it
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
goes through a federally um required
 
01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
consistency review the state will go
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
through that process where we identify
 
01:38:53.709 --> 01:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
as a state whether or not that project
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
if it falls in this case I'm saying if
 
01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
it's within the viewshed meaning it's
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 20 to 25 miles offshore or
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
closer we will go through a process of
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
identifying whether or not there are any
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
issues with that project in terms of
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
impacts on our tourism impacts on our
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
fishing industry impacts on other
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
industries that are ocean that rely on
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
the ocean as well as the environment and
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
if there's any way to put language into
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
the bill that discourages any positive
 
01:39:24.189 --> 01:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
consistency review if the state of New
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire says we don't want this
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
project because it's going to cause
 
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
problems with the environment Pro
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
problems with our fishing industry
 
01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
problems with tourism and dramatically
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
reduce our economic opportunities that
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
are not that exist today and maybe
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
impact it we could tell the federal
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
government we don't support that project
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm talking about but I
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if such language can be put
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
into the bill and leave that to the
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
attorneys okay thank you for helping me
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
understand that I appre appreciate that
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
questions for M
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
lenos representative McGee has one thank
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
my question so you mentioned that you
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure that the one of the
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
points that you made that the state of
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire wasn't responsible for the
 
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.709 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire wasn't responsible for the
the

01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
cost um if other states in the region
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
decide to go forward with the project
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm reminded that and I wonder if
 
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
you could speak to this that uh uh when
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
we when we opted
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
to uh invest Less in Renewables as a
 
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
sector of our energy
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
portfolio we have received increased
 
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
Transmissions cost attributed to New
 
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we're not investing at
 
01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
the same rate as as our neighbor States
 
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
so I I I wonder if you could speak to
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
how you think we could be um protected
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
from the cost
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
if the region goes forward and we decide
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
to opt out I think there might be some
 
01:41:00.109 --> 01:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
penalties and I'm afraid we would end up
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
paying either way we just wouldn't
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily have any benefits yeah thank
 
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
you for that question because that's a
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
very important point the projects that
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
are under construction today Vineyard
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
win and Revolution win off the coast of
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in Rhode Island are under
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
contract with utilities in Massachusetts
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and Connecticut those are
 
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
the only two contracts only two projects
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
right now that feed will feed energy
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
into the New England region those are
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
above Market long-term contracts
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 15 years to to 20 years I
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
believe I don't remember the exact but
 
01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
anyway it's 15 and above years the cost
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the that above market cost that the
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
will only be borne by the rate payers in
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island and
 
01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut to the extent that they are
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
buying the energy so we're talking about
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
15 roughly 1500 megaw that whatever that
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
generates the only people paying for
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
that electricity are the rate payers of
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island and
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut we will not bear any of that
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
cost as because our utilities are not
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
buying that
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
energy now there is a separate cost that
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
I believe you're talking about and and
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington discussed it
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
as well and that is as more and more
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
intermittent regen generation is built
 
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
in the region there's going to be have
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to build grid
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
additional grid infrastructure
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
to support reliability and resilience of
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
our grid system okay and those costs
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
will likely be socialized by the iso New
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
England and we will all bear those costs
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
so as more and more intermittent
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
generation is built within the New
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
England region
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
we will all bear a heavy cost because of
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
that in order to make sure our lights
 
01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
turn on when we turn the switch on
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
because we cannot always rely on weather
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
Reliant weather dependent resources but
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
one last point in terms of the
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
transmission generally the transmission
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
cost that is intended to
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
support renewable energy built in the
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
outer reaches of Maine and New Hampshire
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
to go down into Massachusetts we should
 
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
not be bearing that cost that is
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
generally considered an economic cost
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
not a reliability cost those
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
transmission projects should actually be
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
borne by the developer and the state
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
that's supporting them not by the New
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
England region generally unfortunately
 
01:43:37.589 --> 01:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
there's been a tendency to say well
 
01:43:39.149 --> 01:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
we're all going to benefit by renewable
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
energy so let's just socialize it but so
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
far I don't I don't Herington may know
 
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
better I don't believe any of those
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
projects have been socialized this's the
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
one coming on down through Maine that I
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
believe Massachusetts was going to cover
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
the cost I'm not sure where that stands
 
01:43:58.990 --> 01:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
right now did that answer your question
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative Swanson has a
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
ma'am um the uh ISO New England provided
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
us a slide a little while ago and uh
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just say what the caption said and
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
if you want you can get some more
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
information from them it's a they said
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
Market select the most cost effect cost
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
efficient resources to meet current and
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
future electricity needs I keep hearing
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
statements that uh investment in Wind
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
sources is going to make things cost
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
more whereas we have a system in place
 
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
that will select and encourage the
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
lowest cost and I canot cannot imagine
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
anybody investing in a generation
 
01:44:48.589 --> 01:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
capability that's not going to be
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
profitable and cost effective and
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
competitive with the other sources that
 
01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
are in the market but is are you saying
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise no what I'm saying is if we
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
really were operating a true
 
01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
market-based generation system here
 
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
meaning you build a gas you're you're a
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
merchant plant you build your gas plant
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because you will make
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
money selling the energy into the grid
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
that is a market decision that a private
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
developer will make and recoup the cost
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
of his Capital cost and make money by
 
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
selling the energy that's not what's
 
01:45:24.189 --> 01:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
happening with wind energy and
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
particularly not happening with offshore
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
wind offshore wind is getting built in
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
New England New York New Jersey all up
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
and down the East Coast because the
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
states have said that they two fold but
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
the states primarily have said we're
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
willing to impose high costs of this
 
01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
generation on our rate payers because we
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
believe it will solve the climate change
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
problem I have more to say about climate
 
01:45:50.589 --> 01:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
change in my next testimony later but um
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
so the federal government want
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
particular the Biden Administration
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to see offsh wind built the
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
states Massachusetts Rhode Island and
 
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
Connecticut in particular wanted to see
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to meet their mandates their Net
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
Zero mandates for energy and as far as
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
they were concerned the cost was worth
 
01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
it New Hampshire is not has not adopted
 
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
a net zero mandate New Hampshire has not
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
said we will build renewable energy at
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
any cost so so there's a difference
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
between what the market is doing and
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
what state in opposed mandates do and
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I think you those should not
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
be confused this we're living with State
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
mandated requirements for this
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
generation thank you Miss lenos thank
 
01:46:33.239 --> 01:46:34.390 align:start position:0%
generation thank you Miss lenos thank
you

01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
chair okay thank you seeing no further
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you for that
 
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and bring up next Sam Evans
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
Brown of clean energy New Hampshire whom
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
committee Sam Evans Brown from clean
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire clean energy New
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does oppose this bill um i'
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
just note on a high level uh New
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically but also New
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
England more generally I think is and
 
01:47:15.149 --> 01:47:15.159 align:start position:0%
has distinguished itself as being the
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
land of no um in my short career
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
watching the energy industry I've
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
watched us run a natural gas pipe
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
pipeline out of the region I've watched
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
us run a transmission line out of the
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
region and now uh I've also watched us
 
01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
run terrestrial wind out of the state of
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and now it seems like
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
we're poised to do the same for offshore
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
wind um I I'm hearing a great deal of uh
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
techno certainty from the testimony the
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
idea that wind is expensive offshore
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
always will be expensive and the prices
 
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
will never come down um I've watched a
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
couple investment Cycles in offshore
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
wind I was very bullish uh in the sort
 
01:47:53.870 --> 01:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
of n 2019 2020 time frame when we were
 
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
seeing offshore wind Tenders in Europe
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
in the $80 a megawatt hour range which
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
would be very competitive in New England
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
um these are very Capital intensive
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
projects and so with interest rates
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
Rising uh we've seen the prices go up
 
01:48:08.109 --> 01:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
which is unfortunate I do I do uh share
 
01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
concerns about the direction of the
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
industry r large but I don't see that as
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
a reason to prohibit the the technology
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
as a whole so uh certainly there are
 
01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
concerns about cost shifting I would
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
just note uh when it comes to ISO New
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
England Market design we' heard a great
 
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
deal about what the impact of more and
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
more intermittent Renewables on on those
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
markets will be um I I could pull uh the
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
numbers for folks but it's important to
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
point out that the energy markets which
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
is you know the the uh the five minute
 
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
auctions that happen every day to that
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
set the price of of the electricity are
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
the Lion's Share of the cost of what
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
goes into the Energy Service rates that
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
that we all pay uh and so saving you
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
know just to put it quite simply if you
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
save a couple billion dollars on the
 
01:48:59.070 --> 01:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
energy markets but see uh the capacity
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
markets go up by by a small amount as
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
long as the savings on the energy side
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
are pay are paying for the increase in
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
the capacity side um then your your
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
bills go down so uh it's not a given
 
01:49:14.189 --> 01:49:14.199 align:start position:0%
that that having the more intermittent
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
Renewables on on the grid will result in
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
in our bills going up um and as several
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
speakers have pointed out these projects
 
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
are being supported by other states uh
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
economically so uh New Hampshire rate
 
01:49:28.589 --> 01:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
payers are not seeing those costs on our
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
bills so uh it it's um it's I think
 
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunate to hear that sort of uh
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
fearmongering um but I think it's not a
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
given that that rates are going to go up
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
as a result of these projects coming
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
online um I don't really have much more
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
to say I I'm sure there's plenty of
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
other folks uh who will come after me
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
who who can speak more to things but
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I got okay that was perfect
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
timing uh representative Harrington has
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
a question for you yeah uh you talk no
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not on this bill no uh you talk
 
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
about uh spending on these you know in
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
the other states it's state mandated
 
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
they the utility has no choice in the
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
matter would you like to see that same
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
mandate be put in New Hampshire and if
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
it came to your money do you or your
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
organization are willing to give
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
voluntarily invest in offshore wind with
 
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
your own money and not somebody else's
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
so so I don't think that's what uh the
 
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
bill in question is is about um uh clean
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
en New Hampshire has in the past been on
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
the record uh in support of of doing
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
offshore wind procurements I think that
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
if we were to if the state of New
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were to purs pursue a
 
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
procurement of offshore wind that rate
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
pair protections it would be important
 
01:50:42.030 --> 01:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
to build those in um but that's not the
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us
 
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
today any additional questions
 
01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yes thank you Mr
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
today Mr Evans Brown um so
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
as I hear all the people who've
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill so far the
 
01:51:01.069 --> 01:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
question that comes to my mind is um
 
01:51:02.189 --> 01:51:02.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not the state of New
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is looking to save money now
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
versus later um I think a lot of times
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
when we hear testimony it's very easy
 
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
for us to say we don't want to spend the
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
money because we're basically Frugal and
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh most people agree with that I think
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
the difference between us and the folks
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the states around us is that they
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
their mandate are coming from a
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
recognition that they will probably have
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
to pay a lot more money later for the
 
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
damage that will be coming as a result
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
of continued overdependence on fossil
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
fuels so it's there's a diversity
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
question that they're trying to meet
 
01:51:38.669 --> 01:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
with their policies that we are not to
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
be making a speech representative trying
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
to clarify the question so so the
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
question is really on the on the balance
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
between pay now pay later um you have a
 
01:51:54.189 --> 01:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
lot of expert you've been uh covering
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
energy for a long time and I guess the
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
question is are we do we do ourselves
 
01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
any favor as a state to ignore the
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
long-term costs that uh appear to be
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
looming if we don't diversify or get
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
serious about having a plan of how we're
 
01:52:12.669 --> 01:52:12.679 align:start position:0%
going to meet energy needs in the future
 
01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't have one uh so so I
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
think I maybe I'll I'll uh try to answer
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
that question with uh and see if see if
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
I can I can land the plan here
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking we have pursued a
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
path of of restructuring of our electric
 
01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
electric Industries whereby the the bulk
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
power sector has been deregulated and
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
operates according to markets um and and
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
everything else is still is still
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
operating under sort of a regulated cost
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
of service model um what we have seen is
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
that that deregulation has resulted in
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
costs going down in all the sectors in
 
01:52:51.790 --> 01:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
which in which markets uh are are
 
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to function
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
um and so broadly I think that policy
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
has has worked uh it's important I think
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
for policymakers as they look at how
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
those markets are working to realize
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
that those markets were designed with a
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
certain set of techn Technologies as as
 
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
the assumed generation portfolio and and
 
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
the latest you know ISO New England is
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
currently talking about redesigning its
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
capacity market and when you look at the
 
01:53:18.430 --> 01:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
papers the the white papers where they
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
talk about that redesign one of the
 
01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:21.639 align:start position:0%
things that they point out is that the
 
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
threeyear Ford capacity Market auction
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
design structure was created because it
 
01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
took about three years to build a
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
natural gas combined cycle turbine uh
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
and that we live in a different world
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
now in which there's a great more
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
diversity in in fuel sources that are
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
being brought into into the markets and
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
so there needs to be a recognition of do
 
01:53:41.229 --> 01:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
we need to change the market design um
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
all that is to say that I think there
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
are are huge questions here regarding do
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
do the current market paradigms that
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're operating under actually serve us
 
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
given the technological world that we
 
01:53:55.629 --> 01:53:55.639 align:start position:0%
live in um and are they providing for
 
01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
the fuel diversity that is going to
 
01:53:59.709 --> 01:53:59.719 align:start position:0%
result in the lowest long-term costs to
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
rate payers all around New England
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
that's a huge question um and I don't
 
01:54:06.189 --> 01:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
think that we that we do ourselves any
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
service by by saying one technology is
 
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
just going to be simply cut out as one
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
of the options which I think is what
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
today okay seeing no more questions I
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
want to thank Mr Brown for being here
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
and call next on Rob Werner who
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
testified earlier for
 
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
the league of conservation voters I
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
believe it
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
was I will be very brief um thank you
 
01:54:34.109 --> 01:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman members of the
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
committee Rob wner State chair League of
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
conservation voters in New England rer
 
01:54:38.719 --> 01:54:39.750 align:start position:0%
conservation voters in New England rer
wi

01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
wi
 
01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
Coalition um sitting here thinking to
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
paraphrase Thomas Hardy uh New Hampshire
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
is not an island we're part of a grid we
 
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
are part of a uh economic uh region a
 
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
vibrant economic region in New England
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of supply chain aspects of
 
01:55:00.069 --> 01:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
offshore wind that's been built that are
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
in operation and I just think that it's
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
very shortsighted to pursue legislation
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
such as this to uh pick winners and
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
losers essentially in terms of an
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
industry I thought that the sense of a
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
lot of policy makers in our in our
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
current government is not to pick winner
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
and lers but that's EXA ly what we're
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
doing here so I I am very opposed to
 
01:55:26.910 --> 01:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and we as an organization are
 
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
very opposed to this bill partly for
 
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
that reason but also the larger sense of
 
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
I think we need as I had said before we
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
need to stay engaged in this project and
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
in these discussions yes there are
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
challenges yes there are questions that
 
01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
need to be answered yes there's a lot
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
more research to be conducted to get to
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
those answers but to Simply turn our
 
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
back and walk away I don't think is the
 
01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:54.310 align:start position:0%
back and walk away I don't think is the

01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
much seeing no further questions for Mr
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
wner we'll Now bring
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
up Jerry Leman from the New England
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
Fisherman's stewardship Association of
 
01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
South Portland
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
Maine good morning and welcome good
 
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Mr chair and fellow
 
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:15.830 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Mr chair and fellow
committee

01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
members uh I am Jerry Leman the CEO of
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
the New England fisherman stewardship
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
Association we represent roughly around
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
th000 members of our Coastal communities
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
these are wild Harvesters everywhere
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
from your high water mark to the e um to
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
touch on a few points um representative
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
Swanson asked about the discharge of the
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
chlorinated heated water you can find
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
that on Sunrise wind appendix
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
N2 um that also talks about a 40%
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
capacity that's at 81. 8.1 million
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
gallons per day discharged at 86 to 90°
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
in their own appendix it also states
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
that it's 100% mortality to Plankton now
 
01:56:57.870 --> 01:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
if you go talk to the Northeast Science
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
Center we've also in witness it over the
 
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
last two and a half decades that
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
Plankton levels in the New England
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
region are in Decline which is directly
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
why we oppose offshore wind at this
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
moment it's not the fact that any
 
01:57:13.709 --> 01:57:13.719 align:start position:0%
Fisherman's against going green it's the
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
fact it's basics in navigation if you
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
don't know where you are you don't know
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
where you're going we have not done
 
01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
enough proper research the EMF effect
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
there's been acoustic studies from the
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
Norway from alisandra Cressy showing
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
that EMF can directly affect larvel
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
statuses of our juvenile fish stocks
 
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
causing them to lose vertical swimming
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
EMF effects also on Lobster carasses
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
which is the majority of your Lobster
 
01:57:39.149 --> 01:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
fishery here in the state of New
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that also shows that not only
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
the eye sockets the carrasses and the
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
vertical swimming are directly inclined
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
now to get the procurement of the power
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
back towards Shore you know what was
 
01:57:53.069 --> 01:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
talked about today by the site analysis
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
of the distance it's well over 50
 
01:57:57.310 --> 01:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
nautical miles to get back here to shore
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
which is going to make you have to use
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
DC cables at a 400 megawatt capacity so
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
for every gwatt you're talking at least
 
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
three cables space 200 to 500 yards
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
apart with a 6x6 dredging that 1,200
 
01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
gallons per minute with 100% mortality
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
to all juvenile life that comes in
 
01:58:15.629 --> 01:58:15.639 align:start position:0%
contact with and as we get closer to
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
shore to the geology is the granite
 
01:58:20.189 --> 01:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
we'll be putting concrete structures
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
over the cables which was going to be
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
creating habitat for lobsters to crawl
 
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
up under to get direct
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
EMF which will directly affect your
 
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
Lobster fishery now the Rosa the
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
responsible offshore science Alliance
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
also just did at the Cooperative
 
01:58:36.189 --> 01:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
research Summit in Portland Main last
 
01:58:38.910 --> 01:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
week showing research that the pile
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
driving noises coming from the sunr
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
vineyard wind and down that way had a
 
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
third scale operation done inside of a
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
harbor was showing the Clappers on the
 
01:58:49.950 --> 01:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
scallops which that means it's stressing
 
01:58:53.310 --> 01:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
the scallops that was at the 1/3
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
scale we do not have enough information
 
01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
to outline what directly is going to
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
happen to the impact Isis committee met
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
at Rhode Island earlier last summer what
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
was mentioned was the United Kingdom and
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
everybody was there is we directly know
 
01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
we're changing the ocean but to what
 
01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
extent we have no idea we are literally
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
leaping before we look which is a direct
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
reason why we take a pause every
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
fisherman in the world will tell you the
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
same thing if you don't know where you
 
01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
are you don't know where you're going
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
and as well I got to talk about the
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
Leading Edge erosion so particulates in
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
our air freeze during the weather
 
01:59:32.189 --> 01:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
variabilities while the speed of these
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
wind blades cause Leading Edge erosion
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
those Nano particulates end up in the
 
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
water column while Nano our phytoplank
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
it mistakes that is forage which ends up
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
working our way into the food chain
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
which is endo disruptors causing
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
reproductive harms not only to satti
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
animals but humans as
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
well I can go on and on but uh the noise
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
pollutants again and not to mention when
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
we have the nor Easter nobody has yet to
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
talk about the parasitic drain these
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
things will still require power that's
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
why there's 5,500 gallons of diesel
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
capacity on here because they will have
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
to go into shutdown mode or otherwise
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
they could be destroyed and yet we have
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
not done any real hurricane force winds
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
the center The Vineyard wind blade was a
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
356 ft blade that was tested in an
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
environmental chamber at 300 ft it was
 
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
not a complete survey but as we saw in
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
July when we lost the wind as everybody
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
must have seen on the news all these
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
particulates floating up on all these
 
02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
wind beaches from New York to Road
 
02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
Island across Massachusetts that was
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
only 6% of the
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
blade in two months that was recovered
 
02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
so just IM imagine what happens when
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
multiple blades fail now we just saw
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
what the devastation and the cost
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
analysis for that cleanup was just for
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
6% 94% of it was still intact on the
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
ocean floor which sat there for months
 
02:00:51.629 --> 02:00:51.639 align:start position:0%
before it was retrieved and yet we have
 
02:00:51.639 --> 02:00:52.430 align:start position:0%
before it was retrieved and yet we have
no

02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
data data or analysis on any of the
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
fiberglass or those micronutrients
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
getting into the wild forage and how
 
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
that affects the health of the community
 
02:01:02.669 --> 02:01:02.679 align:start position:0%
of the wild bystanders you the American
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
public it's a natural resource that
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
belongs to every one of us and the fact
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we could be contaminating our last
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
wild protein it's just
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
unconscionable well thank you I noticed
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
that you had some notes you were reading
 
02:01:18.669 --> 02:01:18.679 align:start position:0%
from do you have written testimony that
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
you could Supply To Us by any chance yes
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
I can draft you up the the written
 
02:01:25.709 --> 02:01:25.719 align:start position:0%
testimony and give you all of the data
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
from all the research um like I said
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
this is all stemming from the Bureau of
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
ocean energy management and the last
 
02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
thing I will state is during the federal
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
process for the lease agreements for the
 
02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
Gulf of main the science center openly
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
filed at the federal registry openly
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
admitting we have no Baseline data in
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Bain which is a direct
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
meaning we do not know where we
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
are so you can provide us links to
 
02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
information about the decline of
 
02:01:56.910 --> 02:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
Plankton the EMF
 
02:01:59.470 --> 02:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
effects the stresses on
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
scallops the quote about we know we're
 
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
changing the ocean but we don't know how
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
yep I will get that from Dr Andy lipsky
 
02:02:07.149 --> 02:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
he's the head of the greater Atlantic
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
wind team and for the question about
 
02:02:11.149 --> 02:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
high wind Tempest they were put in in
 
02:02:13.069 --> 02:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
2017 and they've all had to go back to
 
02:02:15.709 --> 02:02:15.719 align:start position:0%
port for major reconstruction so those
 
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:17.719 align:start position:0%
are still not tested vetted and not to
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
mention those are four-part anchoring
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
systems in the United Kingdom while
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're only being proposed three
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
anchoring systems per turbine here but
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
we do not know which model we're using
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's unvetted technology they're all
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
prototypes okay further
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions Vice chair Thomas has one
 
02:02:37.470 --> 02:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question although you you may
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
have provided an answer but I will ask
 
02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
the question anyway um I know that from
 
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
my personal experience I have seen
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
several of your videos that you've put
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
out on just what you uh uh said here
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
here and I believe they provided um um
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
background information and links and so
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
forth to substantiate what you were
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
saying have any of the uh has any of the
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
information that you presented in these
 
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
videos have they ever been disputed by
 
02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
any uh agencies as to be
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
incorrect uh or and also do you believe
 
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
that any of what you've put out there
 
02:03:19.709 --> 02:03:19.719 align:start position:0%
any questions have they been answered to
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
your satisfaction before you can proceed
 
02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:22.629 align:start position:0%
your satisfaction before you can proceed
forward

02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh as for one a lot of folks have taken
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
stuff that I've said out of context and
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
tried to mix it but everything is
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
verified through peer rever
 
02:03:33.149 --> 02:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed research not only from the
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
science and statistical committees but
 
02:03:37.069 --> 02:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
from the science center alone who is
 
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
retrieving all of our data for the New
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
England region they also set the
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
allocations for the fishing fleet as
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
well and the fact that during covid we
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
did no data research at all no surveys
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
were done we have no Baseline so the
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
fact that the cited areas that we're
 
02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
looking into the Gulf of main are in
 
02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
high production use from the fishing
 
02:03:58.990 --> 02:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
fleet this will push effort right out of
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
those regions which will end up
 
02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
concentrating effort on another fishery
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
which will impose problems from state to
 
02:04:06.549 --> 02:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire is not out of the
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
fold on this one even though these are
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
outside your state waters the impacts
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative

02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you went over very quickly
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make sure I
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
understood uh got the name the name of
 
02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
the company that says that they're still
 
02:04:34.510 --> 02:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
using chlorine chlorinated water it's in
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
the it's in the appendix N2 on Sunrise
 
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%

02:09:28.350 --> 02:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
environment who depend
 
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
on on it thank you okay thank you since
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony I assume
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be sending that to us I can do
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you all right let's keep
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
moving can I I I have one thing to say
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
if you could give me two seconds okay I
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
heard the term feir wongin you should be
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
scared 100% should be scared of this
 
02:09:55.589 --> 02:09:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you so next we'll
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
um Eric Anderson who I think we heard
 
02:10:11.229 --> 02:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
Anderson uh good morning Mr chairman um
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
I I I I stand as I previously had
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
identified myself um I've been a
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
commercial fisherman for over 50
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
50 years
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
um this issue of offshore wind is is a
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
subject of concern today and it's been
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
the concern of the fishing industry
 
02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:36.599 align:start position:0%
for more than five years from where I
 
02:10:38.910 --> 02:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
originally you know became involved in
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
it and as you've heard with a variety of
 
02:10:46.229 --> 02:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
testimony offshore wind has been
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
sold as a safe and environmental
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
friendly new energy source but nothing
 
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
could be found father from the truth
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
you've heard a variety of environmental
 
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
issues that have been presented to you
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
today and I hope you take take heed in
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
in recognizing them um many New
 
02:11:04.589 --> 02:11:04.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishermen have identified and
 
02:11:06.669 --> 02:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
questioned a long list of environmental
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
issues and consequences that would
 
02:11:11.229 --> 02:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
result in the Gul of main as the
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
development continues most of our
 
02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
questions mostly all of our questions
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
have gone unanswered and issues are
 
02:11:22.589 --> 02:11:22.599 align:start position:0%
shunned by the federal government
 
02:11:25.549 --> 02:11:25.559 align:start position:0%
agencies in control of the development I
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
and other fishing colleagues have
 
02:11:30.990 --> 02:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
responded and submitted many written
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
comments to the Bureau of ocean um
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
Bureau of energy management bom and on
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
every occasion when requested but the
 
02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
process has continued with B recently
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
conducting a lease offering of over
 
02:11:44.599 --> 02:11:47.069 align:start position:0%
conducting a lease offering of over
850,000

02:11:47.069 --> 02:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
850,000
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
acres to developers in the Gulf of Maine
 
02:11:51.549 --> 02:11:51.559 align:start position:0%
two companies have acquired a
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of that acreage and
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
continue with plans to build enormous
 
02:11:58.910 --> 02:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
offshore wind farms at their sites with
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
a power coming ashore in either New
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Maine or Massachusetts this
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
power would provide no economic relief
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire rate payers as I think
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
some testimony has
 
02:12:15.629 --> 02:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
recognized um and it would be destined
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
to go south into the uh into the grid um
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
this legisl of pth which substantially
 
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
reduce or eliminate the possibility of
 
02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
that power coming ashore in New
 
02:12:28.750 --> 02:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and either CBR or Portsmouth
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
those have been the two areas that have
 
02:12:33.149 --> 02:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
been identified for the transmission
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
lines if they were to come to New
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if completed it would most
 
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
likely come assure in our neighboring
 
02:12:41.229 --> 02:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
states and the same negative
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
environmental consequences will affect
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
the entire ecosystem of the gulf Comm
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
this legislation have passed will
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
represent new h e efforts and concern to
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
question offshore wind for any energy
 
02:12:58.589 --> 02:12:58.599 align:start position:0%
benefit and show its concern for the
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
real negative environmental causes
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
consequences that will unfold in the
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
future thank
 
02:13:08.589 --> 02:13:08.599 align:start position:0%
you okay thank
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
you seeing no questions we'll move along
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
and bring Nate Graves who's wearing a
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
new hat now representing the business
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
and industry Association to give us
 
02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.390 --> 02:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Mr chair and
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee n Grace the
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce we oppose
 
02:13:33.629 --> 02:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
this legislation I did pass out a uh
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
letter earlier I don't want to be
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
needlessly repetitive um but we have a
 
02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
all of all of the above approach to
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
energy so we would uh prefer that the
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
committee not foreclose any uh potential
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I would just remind the
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
committee that we cannot predict what uh
 
02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
future technological advances May uh
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
enable this particular or any particular
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
type of energy to uh to be more
 
02:14:04.750 --> 02:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
competitive uh be more friendly towards
 
02:14:06.430 --> 02:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh some of the concerns you heard today
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that you
 
02:14:11.709 --> 02:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
may have questions representative Wendy
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you chair um specifically
 
02:14:16.990 --> 02:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
because you are representing the
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association I'm
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could give me an idea
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the economic impact specifically to
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
Industry and jobs if if we forego all
 
02:14:32.069 --> 02:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't have industry specific
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
data I can certainly see if I can get
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
that I think generally speaking by
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
foreclosing a specific energy type uh
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
future job growth that may exist so a
 
02:14:47.069 --> 02:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
future investment that may come from
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
other businesses would not occur because
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
it would not exist and it's kind kind of
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
hard for me to provide data about what
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
future jobs may exist depending on what
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
future Technologies May evolve
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
understood thank
 
02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
you seeing no additional questions I
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for your testimony
 
02:15:08.430 --> 02:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
written and um delivered
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
personally oh sorry representative McGee
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
thought of one thank you Mr chair for
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
indulging me nice to see you n um so the
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
question is again around um the economic
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
impact for businesses is I guess that
 
02:15:25.549 --> 02:15:25.559 align:start position:0%
would be your bellwick right um if we
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
are uh Banning with a bill like this our
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
ability to participate in
 
02:15:35.069 --> 02:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
planning um and the other states move
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
forward then would that be considered um
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
a negative impact to local businesses
 
02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
and jobs because there would be a lot I
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
know I've seen um discussion around all
 
02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
the activity that would be resulting uh
 
02:15:52.990 --> 02:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of supply chain as others have
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned so um would would it be a
 
02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
missed opportunity from the perspective
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
of the business and industry uh
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
Association if a large scale project
 
02:16:03.229 --> 02:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
like that was occurring and we had no
 
02:16:07.709 --> 02:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
part in it so we certainly promote um
 
02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
competitive advantag just broadly is is
 
02:16:13.229 --> 02:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
something that organization promotes um
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
one thing I would keep in mind um as you
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
consider this legislation and other
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislation is that you know although um
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
we are part of the the regional grid and
 
02:16:26.990 --> 02:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
and everything um one of the major
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
concerns that uh industry has
 
02:16:31.310 --> 02:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
particularly manufacturers is the cost
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
of energy here so it's not only
 
02:16:36.509 --> 02:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
potential jobs uh that exist but it's
 
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
also you know within this particular
 
02:16:41.669 --> 02:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
industry but it's also uh especially as
 
02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
we look at uh the federal
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
administration's efforts to bring uh
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
additional manufacturing to the United
 
02:16:49.950 --> 02:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
States one of the key things for our
 
02:16:51.629 --> 02:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
organization is making sure that New
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is highly competitive and the
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
number one issue we hear from
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers is the cost of energy so
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
when they're thinking about are we are
 
02:17:00.309 --> 02:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
we going to expand the plant here in New
 
02:17:01.950 --> 02:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we going to expand the plant
 
02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
in you know Texas um one of the things
 
02:17:06.270 --> 02:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
they're looking at is that energy cost
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
overall and so we that's why we promote
 
02:17:10.509 --> 02:17:10.519 align:start position:0%
the all of the above uh solution in
 
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
order to try to lower those costs make
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire more competitive bring
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
more jobs
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
here representative Harrington has a
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
take my question I'm not sure if you be
 
02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
able to answer this but my concern with
 
02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
the bill is that it talks about banning
 
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure coming into New Hampshire
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
so that would be let's assume that we're
 
02:17:33.669 --> 02:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking no one's going to build
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
wind within the territorial Waters so
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a federally license
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
facility that's more than three miles
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
offshore so they bring that transmission
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
cable in through New Hampshire does New
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have the authority to ban that
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
transmission cable if it's going to
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
provide Power let's say to Massachusetts
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
or is is that uh a FK
 
02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
issue I think there are plenty of people
 
02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
in the audience behind me who could
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay fire
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
enough okay any others no questions
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll call next
 
02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:10.190 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll call next
on

02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good morning and welcome good
 
02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:24.599 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for having me um my
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
name is Tara federov um I um am from
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
kbur New Hampshire I have a farm um up
 
02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
there Family Farm um and I oppose this
 
02:18:36.629 --> 02:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
bill it is a continuation of the attacks
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
on clean energy that we are seeing from
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
the current federal
 
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
Administration uh I love this great
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
state for a lot of reasons the beautiful
 
02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:46.599 align:start position:0%
Outdoors the interconnected supportive
 
02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
community and the self-reliant Spirit
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters are wonderful and embody
 
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
the best of the past and all of the
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
promise of a more beautiful and
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
sustainable future through our love for
 
02:18:58.509 --> 02:18:58.519 align:start position:0%
all things hyperlocal growing our own
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
food the farmers markets and supporting
 
02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
each other but most of my friends and
 
02:19:04.589 --> 02:19:04.599 align:start position:0%
neighbors and most of the residents in
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
this state power their homes with
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
damaging imported fossil fuels that make
 
02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
us relyant on outside actors for
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
something as basic as heating our own
 
02:19:15.629 --> 02:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
homes wind power allows us to embrace
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
our hyper local self-reliant spirit and
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
by not being reliant on anyone but
 
02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
ourselves for our energy uh and bringing
 
02:19:25.230 --> 02:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
job growth and economic prosperity to
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
the people of this great state imagine
 
02:19:28.950 --> 02:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
how great it would be to have a
 
02:19:30.910 --> 02:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
completely local reliable and affordable
 
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
power source that also ensures a livable
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
future for all of our kids and grandkids
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
and is indefinitely available the nhcap
 
02:19:40.750 --> 02:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
or the New Hampshire climate action plan
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
states that the effects of climate
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
change could increase the number of days
 
02:19:45.549 --> 02:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
that are over 100 degrees in New
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from one per year to 23 or
 
02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
more I remember marveling if it even hit
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
80 here when I was a kid uh in this
 
02:19:55.710 --> 02:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
future things that we love here in New
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like pond hockey ice fishing
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
and white Christmases could be gone
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
forever and I really want my kids to
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
have those things in their lives wind
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
power helps us fight against this
 
02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
dystopian future decrease air pollution
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
and increase our power economically
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
making both ourselves and this be and
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
the Beautiful Outdoors that we are
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
surrounded by healthier and happier
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels did great things for our
 
02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
state but they are not our future
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
ideally it is the job of the government
 
02:20:23.950 --> 02:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
to take a Long View the CL climate
 
02:20:26.230 --> 02:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
crisis will cost uh billions if not
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
trillions in future damages fossil fuels
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
damage our uh atmosphere biodiversity
 
02:20:35.389 --> 02:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
and oceans through uh oil spills and
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
pollution and we subsidize them with
 
02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
billions of taxpayer dollars every
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
single year certain communities in the
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
US can literally light their water on
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
fire because of fossil fuel
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
pollution uh there is no zero impact
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
energy source as many have said today
 
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
but investments in renewable energy that
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
is less carbon intensive now will divert
 
02:20:56.349 --> 02:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
much of the economic environmental and
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
human costs in the future and um yeah I
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
really support wind and uh and renewable
 
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
energy thank you okay thank you seeing
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
no questions we'll move along to Julie
 
02:21:27.469 --> 02:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
we have four more people who want to
 
02:21:34.990 --> 02:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
border

02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
border
 
02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:38.510 align:start position:0%
border
sorry

02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm used to talking to animals not
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
people so bear with
 
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
me I have a farm as well and I've seen
 
02:21:47.309 --> 02:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
what these things can do I'm just going
 
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
to cover a couple things right now in
 
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
Newbury port
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
in the industrial park there's been a
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
windmill there for 10 years and a couple
 
02:21:58.830 --> 02:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
weeks ago it it blew blew up or bleue
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
gasket or whatever it did and spread
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
hydraulic flu because these things use
 
02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
an excessive amount of fuel matter of
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
fact it takes energy to get them up and
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
running so newburry Port right now is a
 
02:22:13.469 --> 02:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
Hazmat situation hydraulic fuel is all
 
02:22:15.870 --> 02:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
over in radius of at least I don't know
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the industrial park and the condos
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
and the people are very
 
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
upset I going to Farm in Portsmith a
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
million years ago the head farm and John
 
02:22:27.389 --> 02:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
had a windmill he shut the windmill down
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't wasn't giving him any money
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
at all thing was a waste so they
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
dismantled the
 
02:22:35.389 --> 02:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
windmill just a note on the dead
 
02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
citation list those are on the East
 
02:22:40.030 --> 02:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
Coast primarily in New York and New
 
02:22:43.469 --> 02:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
Jersey I really will send you that
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
list hang
 
02:22:49.389 --> 02:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
on so in July this summer a 350t blade
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
fell off a turb and Vineyard one during
 
02:22:54.990 --> 02:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
testing wasn't even up and running this
 
02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
sent 60 tons of fiberglass with banol
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
and other psaf and a mystery foam that
 
02:23:01.870 --> 02:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
is not washed up has been washing up all
 
02:23:04.349 --> 02:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
over the East Coast just yesterday
 
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
another large piece of foam was found on
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
the beach in Nantucket the company
 
02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
abandoned them the Islanders cleaned up
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
the foam not the company the company is
 
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
still responsible for this and they
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
aren't answering they're I think Dutch
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
company which gets me to another point
 
02:23:23.630 --> 02:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
you talk about economy they're bringing
 
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
in their own people they're not hiring
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
our people if you really want to get
 
02:23:28.269 --> 02:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
down to the Brass tax they're bringing
 
02:23:30.670 --> 02:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
in ask New Bedford ask how many Union
 
02:23:35.110 --> 02:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
farms yes we should turn our back on
 
02:23:42.190 --> 02:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
this wind
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
problem there are other Al Alternatives
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
nuclear is huge and it's up and coming
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
and it's clean and there there there
 
02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
don't even melt melting down anymore
 
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
they're using spent rods which is huge
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
for me cuz I actually walked on the seab
 
02:23:57.550 --> 02:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
brook occupation so now I'm actually for
 
02:24:01.950 --> 02:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
nuclear my dad worked on a um there's a
 
02:24:04.349 --> 02:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
generator sitting on the JIS suin bridge
 
02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
and it's been ticking under there for
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
like 20 years and it's making energy
 
02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
problem is there's no money for hydro
 
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
that thing's been sitting there and
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
generating energy no one will look at it
 
02:24:18.269 --> 02:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
UNH is doing this it so I want you to
 
02:24:20.590 --> 02:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
just in closing pay attention to the
 
02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
fishermen next time you go to the
 
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
grocery store I want you to look where
 
02:24:26.190 --> 02:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
your fish is coming from never mind meat
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
which is coming from Australia and
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
Brazil look at where the fish is coming
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
from do we really want we've done a job
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
on the farmers my whole life here do we
 
02:24:35.950 --> 02:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
really want to do that to these
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
fishermen do we really want to not have
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
local fish do we really want to rely on
 
02:24:44.429 --> 02:24:44.439 align:start position:0%
Indonesia Japan thank
 
02:24:48.830 --> 02:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you seeing no questions we'll
 
02:24:51.230 --> 02:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
move along and hear from quick off of
 
02:25:18.429 --> 02:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.670 --> 02:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
Foundation good morning I'm Nick cof
 
02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
with the conservation law Foundation
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
again appreciate being here to testify
 
02:25:25.790 --> 02:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
an opposition to HB
 
02:25:28.910 --> 02:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
575 um this committee often says that we
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't pick winners or losers for the
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
state's Energy Mix um but because this
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
build do exactly that and what cause our
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
state to miss out on the benefits of
 
02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
offshore wind this committee should
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
reject the
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
bill offshore wind projects in the Gulf
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
of Maine would generate major economic
 
02:25:46.469 --> 02:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
benefits for the State of New Hampshire
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
um there was a report recently issued by
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
the department of new Department of
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire that estimates that
 
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
a single offshore wind project in the
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine would generate over 3600
 
02:25:59.110 --> 02:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
jobs and $800 million in benefits for
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
the state and that's a single 1,200
 
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt project um the other thing is
 
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doesn't have much
 
02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority over offshore wind
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's mostly Federal so the bill will not
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
stop offshore wind from being developed
 
02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
in the Gulf of Maine meaning that Maine
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts and not New Hampshire
 
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
receive the economic benefits of
 
02:26:19.710 --> 02:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
offshore offshore wind um offshore wind
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
will also reduce our dependence on
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
imported fossil fuels with extremely
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
volatile prices um recent studies show
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
that offshore wind can also improve the
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
electric grids reliability that's
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
especially true in Winter we all know
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
that in winter you know offshore the
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
wind blows pretty consistently and
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
strongly and so that offshore wind can
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
provide um reliability benefits in
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
Winter um you know over the past few
 
02:26:42.750 --> 02:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
years we've seen High Energy prices um
 
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire families have
 
02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
experienced and um this bill would make
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
us even more exposed to high prices from
 
02:26:51.269 --> 02:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
um fossil fuel energy now one one final
 
02:26:53.469 --> 02:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
point is that the bill claims that it is
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
necessary necessary to protect New
 
02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's natural resources and his
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
Coastal and Maritime Industries um but
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
the process of identifying the wind
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
lease areas in the Gulf of Maine it was
 
02:27:06.990 --> 02:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
a very thorough process and considered
 
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
all of those issues um I participated
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
directly in that process um I witnessed
 
02:27:13.349 --> 02:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
how Federal Regulators they frequently
 
02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
met with stakeholders you know
 
02:27:16.590 --> 02:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
environmental organizations fishermen
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders tribes um you know
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
they ended up leasing areas in the Gulf
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
of Maine that avoid the most heavily
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
fished areas and the areas that are most
 
02:27:28.269 --> 02:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
important for wildlife habitat um and
 
02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
I've also seen in Southern New England
 
02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
how Federal Regulators they require
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
projects to adopt strict mitigation
 
02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
measures to reduce impacts even further
 
02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
um for ocean users and for for wildlife
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
um and so for those reasons I would urge
 
02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
you to reject this Bill thank
 
02:27:47.790 --> 02:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington has a
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chairman
 
02:27:53.269 --> 02:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'll
 
02:27:55.389 --> 02:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
ask you the same question do you think
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill uh oversteps State
 
02:28:00.990 --> 02:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
Authority in that uh the regulation of
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
transmission is a f jurisdictional and
 
02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
would end up in court if nothing else
 
02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think it could um you know
 
02:28:10.269 --> 02:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
I questioned that myself and I you know
 
02:28:12.269 --> 02:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
read the bill a couple times you know I
 
02:28:13.950 --> 02:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
think the state probably has
 
02:28:15.469 --> 02:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for you know the
 
02:28:17.309 --> 02:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
transmission when it comes to shore but
 
02:28:18.269 --> 02:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
I think once you start trying to
 
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
regulate you know the transmission of
 
02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
electric within state borders then
 
02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's a federal issue under the federal
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
power act and so you know depending on
 
02:28:27.269 --> 02:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
how you read the bill I'm not sure if
 
02:28:28.830 --> 02:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's trying to prohibit the transmission
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
of electricity from offer within the
 
02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
state but that I think would definitely
 
02:28:35.269 --> 02:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
FBA okay thank you for that seeing no
 
02:28:40.349 --> 02:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
further questions we'll move along to
 
02:28:40.359 --> 02:28:47.349 align:start position:0%
further questions we'll move along to
CIA

02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
Kelly welcome back thank you Mr chairman
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
um I would like to um ask everyone in
 
02:28:57.550 --> 02:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
this room and all that watching to
 
02:29:01.710 --> 02:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
please um Google up the word the modern
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
day Sil
 
02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
road that is used to be in China and
 
02:29:10.429 --> 02:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
that's all the traffic with the silk now
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
this modern day Silk
 
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
Road has been developed by the Chinese
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
communist government to control all the
 
02:29:19.469 --> 02:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
ports and all the trans important
 
02:29:19.479 --> 02:29:20.670 align:start position:0%
ports and all the trans important
transportation

02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:29:23.269 --> 02:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
to control the world and has been going
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
on a normal citizen like me know about
 
02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
it I'm sure our government should know
 
02:29:31.389 --> 02:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why this project was
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
rushed by the Biden Administration to
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
have it auction off at the end of
 
02:29:38.590 --> 02:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
October before the election to make it
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
legal biding and most of the people that
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
been up here opposing this uh bill I did
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
not see them attend these meetings and I
 
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
spoke to those people at the meetings
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
and they don't create jobs for Americans
 
02:29:56.590 --> 02:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have the expertise nor
 
02:29:59.269 --> 02:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
technology or capability all the
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
materials and M Power imported into
 
02:30:06.990 --> 02:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
these projects and the second thing that
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
you need to know is the silk war
 
02:30:15.309 --> 02:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
strategy War we have been at war with
 
02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
China all these years if you need to I
 
02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
can come back and give you a whole
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
presentation about that it's at we at
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
war that we don't even know that we are
 
02:30:29.070 --> 02:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
at War we're losing our job our natural
 
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
resources China don't care a damn thing
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
about green de de whatever they destroy
 
02:30:38.190 --> 02:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
the Earth they get the advantage of
 
02:30:40.269 --> 02:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
economic environment everything to sell
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
everything cheap to us and took away all
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
of our job and supplies So Co remember
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
the vaccine they prevent those thing to
 
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh I mean the mask to bring back to our
 
02:30:55.150 --> 02:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
country here they are planning to kill
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
just not just American it's the whole
 
02:31:00.510 --> 02:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
world because the flag of China the big
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
yellow star up there with all the four
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
stars around that mean China rule the
 
02:31:07.830 --> 02:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
whole world with
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
Communism they are projecting themselves
 
02:31:13.309 --> 02:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
at the world leader we have to be all
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
under the Communist rule so if you
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
imagine that you have your power feeding
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
the and new Hampshire in the winter time
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the wires are in the ocean have you
 
02:31:25.630 --> 02:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
watched what happened in Europe with all
 
02:31:28.269 --> 02:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
these cable got cut off so we going to
 
02:31:30.910 --> 02:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
be freezing to death relying on those
 
02:31:33.790 --> 02:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
things so these people that's supporting
 
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
something that they don't even know once
 
02:31:38.870 --> 02:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
you are dead or your family is dead you
 
02:31:40.349 --> 02:31:40.359 align:start position:0%
have no money to
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
count life is important food is
 
02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
important water is important National
 
02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
Security is very important we are at War
 
02:31:50.429 --> 02:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
we have been at War
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and I support this bill for
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
the record thank you thank
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
you all right let's next hear from
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%

nature conservancy and I um am sending
 
02:32:31.269 --> 02:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
around a testimony letter that actually
 
02:32:33.230 --> 02:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
covers all three offshore wind bills
 
02:32:35.269 --> 02:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
that you'll be hearing this morning um
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
and I do have to let you know chairman
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
Vose I do have to leave shortly so I
 
02:32:40.349 --> 02:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
need to withdraw my pink card for the
 
02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
next Bill thank you um The Nature

02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
of work on environmental issues in New
 
02:32:50.269 --> 02:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we also have been working
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
globally um for more than four decades
 
02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%

02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:56.870 align:start position:0%
on a range of ocean issues focused on
protecting

02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%

and supporting sustainable Fisheries uh
 
02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
we deeply respect the fishermen um who
 
02:33:14.469 --> 02:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
work so hard off of our Waters and who
 
02:33:18.110 --> 02:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
also uh go out of their way to protect
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
and avoid um damage to many of our
 
02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
important marine
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
species we do believe that thoughtfully
 
02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
planned and cited offshore wind
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
development can be compatible with other
 
02:33:31.309 --> 02:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
ocean issues uh we also agree that there
 
02:33:34.269 --> 02:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
are many questions that remain and we I
 
02:33:37.150 --> 02:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
have uh staff colleagues who are working
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
very hard um at every level to make sure
 
02:33:43.269 --> 02:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
that the sighting is done in a sensitive
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
way um and that mitigation uh does take
 
02:33:49.389 --> 02:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
place we agree with many of the other
 
02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
speak ERS uh who have said that even if
 
02:33:54.269 --> 02:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doesn't want to purchase
 
02:33:57.150 --> 02:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
wind energy others in the region will be
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
doing that and will that will result um
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
in uh offshore wind being built and we
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a mistake for us not to be at
 
02:34:08.830 --> 02:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
the table to ensure that our state is
 
02:34:11.790 --> 02:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
protected and that um folks like
 
02:34:13.389 --> 02:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
fishermen and local communities can
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
benefit from mitigation funds uh the
 
02:34:18.429 --> 02:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
attachment to my testimony letter which
 
02:34:20.190 --> 02:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
I will send to you electronic Ally so
 
02:34:25.230 --> 02:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
you have it um is a series of webinar
 
02:34:27.469 --> 02:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
that we did recently on offshore wind
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
issues and they're all recorded on
 
02:34:31.630 --> 02:34:31.640 align:start position:0%
YouTube um a couple I wanted to draw to
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
your attention um there was a session
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
these are all with um experts in various
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
Fields including scientists there's one
 
02:34:42.030 --> 02:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
on whales in offshore wind addressing
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
myths and facts one about offshore wind
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
and birds with um two experts from aabon
 
02:34:51.309 --> 02:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the both the risks and the
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
benefits of offshore wind to uh birds
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
and also um there's one on the
 
02:34:59.269 --> 02:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
interactions between fish and offshore
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
02:35:07.950 --> 02:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Thomas Wendy Thomas
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
has a question for you uh thank you
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you for being here um
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to the um the leases that
 
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
have been permitted um in the Gulf of
 
02:35:21.469 --> 02:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
Maine is can you tell me is there a
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
standardized policy or process to robust
 
02:35:27.269 --> 02:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
to robustly study the environmental
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
issues uh when considering offshore wind
 
02:35:32.429 --> 02:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
and who is responsible for conducting
 
02:35:32.439 --> 02:35:34.389 align:start position:0%
and who is responsible for conducting
those

02:35:34.389 --> 02:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
studies I believe yes there are rigorous
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
processes and I also believe that
 
02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
various parties are responsible for
 
02:35:45.150 --> 02:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
different aspects of it um I do know
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
that my colleagues who specialize in
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
offshore wind issues have Prov provided
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
comments in the various processes um
 
02:35:56.269 --> 02:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
advocating for very rigorous
 
02:36:01.389 --> 02:36:01.399 align:start position:0%
analysis um as Mr kof mentioned um I
 
02:36:03.950 --> 02:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
believe it was him um some of the lease
 
02:36:08.830 --> 02:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
areas have been tailored to try to um
 
02:36:11.309 --> 02:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
avoid impacting the most critically
 
02:36:15.309 --> 02:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas and the most um at risk
 
02:36:18.830 --> 02:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
species um like endangered whales um and
 
02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
we also have provided comments on um
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
once the turbin are deployed you know
 
02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
what kind of monitoring should be taking
 
02:36:31.710 --> 02:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
place um and different ways that
 
02:36:33.630 --> 02:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts uh could be
 
02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
mitigated so you know if if this is of
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
interest to the committee um to do a
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
deeper dive I'd be happy to arrange a
 
02:36:43.389 --> 02:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
time for one of my colleagues to come
 
02:36:46.830 --> 02:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
talk in more detail thank
 
02:36:51.150 --> 02:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you see no further questions
 
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
we'll give the last word on this bill to
 
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
Mr John Gage Mr Gage you have three
 
02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
minutes please uh confine your comments
 
02:37:03.790 --> 02:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
itself thank you chairman Bo and
 
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
committee um John Gage I'm speaking for
 
02:37:12.030 --> 02:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
myself I oppose this bill um last
 
02:37:14.269 --> 02:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
January last month was the warmest
 
02:37:15.670 --> 02:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
January on
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
record last year was the warmest year on
 
02:37:21.469 --> 02:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
record the year before that was the
 
02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
second warmest year on record the last
 
02:37:26.349 --> 02:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
decade has been the warmest DEC decade
 
02:37:28.990 --> 02:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
on record the records go back to
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
1880 um so I've heard comments about
 
02:37:35.550 --> 02:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
lobsters and whales about this bill uh I
 
02:37:37.110 --> 02:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
grew up in Connecticut we used to go
 
02:37:39.309 --> 02:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
sailing in the fish's Island Sound Off
 
02:37:40.990 --> 02:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
the shore of Connecticut and there were
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
Lobster buoys all over the place there
 
02:37:45.990 --> 02:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
are none anymore off the Connecticut
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
Shore because the water has warmed uh
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
leading to disease and death of the
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
lobster population there um you can sail
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
and fish is Island Sound without
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
worrying about Lobster Pot buoys anymore
 
02:38:02.429 --> 02:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
um so the lobsters have moved North
 
02:38:05.710 --> 02:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
where the water is cooler and out deeper
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
where the water is cooler uh they're not
 
02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
stopping their migration because the
 
02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
water is still
 
02:38:14.950 --> 02:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
warming someone mentioned socialized
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
costs I passed out an economist
 
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
statement on carbon dividends the last
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
bill um statement is signed by 3,600
 
02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
some us economists noting that this is
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh carbon price and is necessary to
 
02:38:34.110 --> 02:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
address a failure of the market uh to
 
02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
account for the social costs of the
 
02:38:37.469 --> 02:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
pollution from fossil fuels and the
 
02:38:38.750 --> 02:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
price of fossil
 
02:38:43.469 --> 02:38:43.479 align:start position:0%
fuels um these external costs are what's
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
driving lobsters north um somebody
 
02:38:48.429 --> 02:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned Wales whales are changing
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
their migration pattern because the
 
02:38:52.269 --> 02:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
oceans are warming and phytoplankton
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
their feeding on is moving um this is
 
02:38:57.950 --> 02:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
moving them into shipping lanes whales
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
are not getting hurt by offshore wind
 
02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
whales are getting hurt by changing the

and getting hit and also um Lobster
 
02:39:13.309 --> 02:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
lines so this bill is not market-based
 
02:39:16.670 --> 02:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
or technology neutral this is kind of a
 
02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
hypocritical um piece of legislation to
 
02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
a a group of people who who says that
 
02:39:24.510 --> 02:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's what they're in favor of and I
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
account for this part two on the war on
 
02:39:30.429 --> 02:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
wind power is coming from Alec uh a
 
02:39:32.910 --> 02:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel funded organization that is
 
02:39:34.510 --> 02:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
against anything that will reduce the
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
sale of fossil fuels um Alec is a thumb
 
02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
of the fossil fuel industry pushing down
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
on New
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire please confine your remarks to
 
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
the bill itself please sure to go to
 
02:39:52.750 --> 02:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
bitly faced game to read more on that um
 
02:39:54.190 --> 02:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
we should not be listening to the fossil
 
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
fuel out of state pollut industry to
 
02:39:59.710 --> 02:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
determine New Hampshire's energy um
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
positions and the options that we choose
 
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
to take we should be going um on what
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
our core principles are we we need a
 
02:40:10.750 --> 02:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
diverse energy Supply we should be
 
02:40:13.630 --> 02:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
market-based and we should also account
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
for a future price on carbon and you can
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
learn more about that at bitly Carbon

just before we took a lunch
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
break so now we're going to resume that
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing and I'm going to ask the
 
03:52:52.590 --> 03:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of
 
03:52:56.229 --> 03:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
hc4 Representative and vice chair Doug
 
03:52:58.750 --> 03:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
Thomas to introduce this
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:53:03.389 --> 03:53:03.399 align:start position:0%
thank you and good afternoon to the
 
03:53:05.550 --> 03:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
distinguished members of the Science
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
Tech and energy
 
03:53:10.510 --> 03:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Doug Thomas I
 
03:53:13.229 --> 03:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham County 16 which is
 
03:53:16.710 --> 03:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
the town of Londoner I might add it is
 
03:53:18.750 --> 03:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
not a coastal town it's pretty much
 
03:53:22.110 --> 03:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
Inland and I don't believe I have any
 
03:53:24.269 --> 03:53:24.279 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen departing out of
 
03:53:27.269 --> 03:53:27.279 align:start position:0%
there at the time I will preface my
 
03:53:31.070 --> 03:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
comment by saying that um I do not and
 
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
have not ever attended a conference from
 
03:53:36.110 --> 03:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
Alec nor have I read any of their
 
03:53:38.870 --> 03:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
material my comments today are from
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
local sources and from what I have
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
learned sitting on the uh offshore wind
 
03:53:47.070 --> 03:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
and Port development
 
03:53:50.070 --> 03:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
commission I will preface again my next
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
comments by making a
 
03:53:54.830 --> 03:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
comment for those of you that have
 
03:53:56.590 --> 03:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
watched TV a long time ago you may have
 
03:53:58.830 --> 03:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
seen a commercial and the commercial
 
03:54:02.349 --> 03:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
went something like this when EF Hutton
 
03:54:04.750 --> 03:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
speaks people
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
listen I believe that the New Hampshire
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
fishermen are the EF Hutton of the
 
03:54:13.469 --> 03:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
fishing industry and I listened and I
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
listened October the 28th at one of our
 
03:54:17.910 --> 03:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
commission meetings when the general
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
public came and offered their opposition
 
03:54:24.670 --> 03:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
to Offshore wind and had very little to
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
do with renewable energy uh Pros or cons
 
03:54:32.030 --> 03:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
it had a lot to do with the ecosystem
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
and the dangers it presented to the
 
03:54:35.710 --> 03:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
lifestyle of our
 
03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
fishermen now so as I listened I
 
03:54:42.229 --> 03:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
listened to people from the U New
 
03:54:44.349 --> 03:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
England fisherman stward Association
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
which I mentioned earlier uh today which
 
03:54:50.349 --> 03:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
put out some very good videos on their
 
03:54:53.269 --> 03:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
concerns I know that fishmen know their
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
Waters best better than any government
 
03:54:58.550 --> 03:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat that I'm aware of and I
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
listened and I
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
researched and I and I and I did I did
 
03:55:07.870 --> 03:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
see pros and cons and the details from
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
this resolution were taken from these
 
03:55:12.429 --> 03:55:12.439 align:start position:0%
pros and cons
 
03:55:16.429 --> 03:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
which really says there are unanswered
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
questions to Offshore wind in the Gulf
 
03:55:22.790 --> 03:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
of Maine and because it's in the Gulf of
 
03:55:26.550 --> 03:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
Maine it affects more than just Maine
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
fishermen it affects New Hampshire
 
03:55:29.710 --> 03:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
fishermen because they all fish in that
 
03:55:30.830 --> 03:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
area and affects a lot of other
 
03:55:34.990 --> 03:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
fishermen there as as as well uh
 
03:55:38.429 --> 03:55:38.439 align:start position:0%
concerns are potential seabed Disturbed
 
03:55:40.710 --> 03:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
from moving cables back and forth it
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
could affect the the ecosystem and the U
 
03:55:47.149 --> 03:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
the the your food chain uh the area that
 
03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
was is being cordoned off can reduce the
 
03:55:52.750 --> 03:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
fishing area and also uh as you heard
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
earlier there is pollution from chlorine
 
03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
infested warm water that is discharged
 
03:56:00.349 --> 03:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
from cooling stations which is necessary
 
03:56:02.429 --> 03:56:02.439 align:start position:0%
to keep those cooling stations operating
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
in a prime in in Prime condition now the
 
03:56:10.870 --> 03:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm doing a resolution is
 
03:56:13.349 --> 03:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
because offshore wind is in federal
 
03:56:17.030 --> 03:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
territory and we cannot pass a bill that
 
03:56:19.870 --> 03:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
prevents the federal government from
 
03:56:22.110 --> 03:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
providing leases to in in a you know
 
03:56:25.110 --> 03:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
federal waters but the
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
resolution has a very prant purpose one
 
03:56:32.349 --> 03:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
of the Prime purposes of a of resolution
 
03:56:35.189 --> 03:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
is to call attention to a pending
 
03:56:39.429 --> 03:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
situation and to uh Provide support for
 
03:56:39.439 --> 03:56:40.469 align:start position:0%
situation and to uh Provide support for
our

03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:56:44.030 --> 03:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
position uh it sends a powerful message
 
03:56:48.309 --> 03:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
to to our Senate to our Senate okay to
 
03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
our Congressional Delegation to our
 
03:56:53.349 --> 03:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
governor and to uh the federal
 
03:56:56.309 --> 03:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
government that New Hampshire
 
03:56:59.710 --> 03:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
categorically rejects offshore wind
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
until and this is the key until such
 
03:57:06.189 --> 03:57:06.199 align:start position:0%
questions that have been unanswered have
 
03:57:09.309 --> 03:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
been completely vetted and
 
03:57:12.910 --> 03:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
verified and only upon approval of the
 
03:57:14.870 --> 03:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:57:17.630 --> 03:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
legislation so this resolution basically
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
says hey stop we don't want this
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
offshore wind to go in those Waters up
 
03:57:25.710 --> 03:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
in Maine because it affects our
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
fishermen as well as others but there
 
03:57:30.510 --> 03:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
are unanswered questions if you can
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
answer them satisfactory particularly to
 
03:57:33.040 --> 03:57:34.070 align:start position:0%
answer them satisfactory particularly to
our

03:57:34.070 --> 03:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:57:37.149 --> 03:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
fishermen then we will consider that but
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
until then we don't want it because
 
03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
you're moving too
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
fast so that's my opening comments
 
03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
because I had a lot more to say but a
 
03:57:48.910 --> 03:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
lot more you heard previously for other
 
03:57:52.349 --> 03:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
bills I would invite everyone here to
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
defay their questions to the people that
 
03:57:56.429 --> 03:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
come here to speak afterwards because
 
03:57:58.229 --> 03:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
they can speak more to the technical
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
aspects uh that have been spoken before
 
03:58:02.229 --> 03:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to take up their time
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
doing that so with that being said um I
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
would prefer you delay your questions to
 
03:58:08.990 --> 03:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
the people behind
 
03:58:12.030 --> 03:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you for introducing that
 
03:58:16.510 --> 03:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
Thomas representative Wendy Thomas
 
03:58:21.070 --> 03:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
insists on asking a question in spite of
 
03:58:24.750 --> 03:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
your request for her not to do that
 
03:58:27.710 --> 03:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
well there you go um it this is a
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
question specifically about the bill um
 
03:58:33.950 --> 03:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
lines 22 and 23 that the general court
 
03:58:36.110 --> 03:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
urges neighboring ocean states to take
 
03:58:39.309 --> 03:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
similar action is that truly your intent
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
to tell other states what to
 
03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
do it is truly my intent to call
 
03:58:47.070 --> 03:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
attention to the other states that they
 
03:58:49.630 --> 03:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
need to listen to their fishermen and to
 
03:58:52.429 --> 03:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
think twice about putting in offshore
 
03:58:54.590 --> 03:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
wind until those questions have been
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
completely vetted because I believe it
 
03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
isn't just the New Hampshire fishermen
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
that have concerns it's main fishermen
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
and and other fishermen thank
 
03:59:09.030 --> 03:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you for introducing this
 
03:59:11.670 --> 03:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Thomas now we
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
have 10 pink cards
 
03:59:17.189 --> 03:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
of people who want to testify on this
 
03:59:20.189 --> 03:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
bill and many of these folks have
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
testified already on the previous two
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
bills that we heard on this
 
03:59:29.229 --> 03:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
subject so I'm going to have to restrict
 
03:59:32.910 --> 03:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
testimony to two minutes per person so
 
03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
that we can get through this these 10
 
03:59:38.349 --> 03:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
pink cards next up is representative
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%

30 C Brook so testifying in support of
 
04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
this resolution um spoken twice already
 
04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
today we're not interested in
 
04:02:24.110 --> 04:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
the offshore wind transmission lines
 
04:02:28.030 --> 04:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
coming ashore to cab Brook if you look
 
04:02:30.510 --> 04:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
at the boam website on the companies
 
04:02:30.520 --> 04:02:31.389 align:start position:0%
at the boam website on the companies
that

04:02:31.389 --> 04:02:31.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
were allowed to bid for the leases in
 
04:02:38.110 --> 04:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of main most of them were um
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
foreign owns I think federally
 
04:02:43.309 --> 04:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
subsidized offshore wind companies
 
04:02:46.149 --> 04:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
displace ing the organic American
 
04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
private sector fishing industry doesn't
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
sound very America first to
 
04:02:51.000 --> 04:02:54.550 align:start position:0%
sound very America first to
me

04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
um what
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
else we're at risk of losing our Cod
 
04:03:01.070 --> 04:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
stocks I'll say
 
04:03:05.790 --> 04:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
that so the frequencies that are emitted
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
by the towers when they're vibrating
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
will attract one of the oldest fishing
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
stocks in
 
04:03:15.149 --> 04:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
America and
 
04:03:17.429 --> 04:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
codfish instead of being out in the
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
waters where they can be fished they
 
04:03:20.510 --> 04:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
will instead be congregating around the
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
windmills themselves unable to be fished
 
04:03:26.110 --> 04:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
by our fishermen so there are secondary
 
04:03:28.269 --> 04:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
and tertiary consequences to be
 
04:03:31.309 --> 04:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
considered with offshore wind and I
 
04:03:34.269 --> 04:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
support the resolution thank
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions for the
 
04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative for testifying on this
 
04:03:46.070 --> 04:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.080 --> 04:03:47.710 align:start position:0%
 
to

04:03:47.710 --> 04:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:03:56.349 --> 04:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
troton tone okay from the Yankee
 
04:04:05.110 --> 04:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
welcome please turn on the mic and you
 
04:04:11.630 --> 04:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
have two minutes please two and a
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
half uh I want to thank the committee
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak here I am the
 
04:04:18.910 --> 04:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Jim tatone I'm from seab
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
Brook I am the U SE Coast commissioner
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire fishing Game
 
04:04:26.189 --> 04:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
Commission I'm also a member of the
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
commission for offshore wind and Port
 
04:04:30.510 --> 04:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
development but I want to make it clear
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
I'm here today strictly as Jim tatone
 
04:04:35.309 --> 04:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
owner and operator of the fishing vessel
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
Fly Girls you know we're talking about
 
04:04:41.790 --> 04:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
preserving our environment and what this
 
04:04:44.070 --> 04:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
wind and this green is going to do but
 
04:04:46.030 --> 04:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
we're not taking into too much of
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
account protecting the pristine
 
04:04:50.590 --> 04:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
environment of the Gulf of Maine the
 
04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
Gulf of
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
Maine is the most productive ecosystem
 
04:04:58.189 --> 04:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
one of the most productive ecosystems in
 
04:05:01.389 --> 04:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
the world it supports over 4,000 species
 
04:05:04.110 --> 04:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
of different marine life and out 80
 
04:05:07.229 --> 04:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
miles off our Coast we have cashous
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
ledge habitat Management Area this area
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
is closed to commercial fishing because
 
04:05:14.189 --> 04:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
it's so important
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
for the life of the Gulf of
 
04:05:21.309 --> 04:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
Maine this cases ledge is an underground
 
04:05:24.389 --> 04:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
is underwater mountain range 35 miles
 
04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
long 6 miles wide it ranges in depth
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
from a th000 feet at its base up to 25
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
ft up the top what's unique about the
 
04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
Cash's ledge is aan rock at its peak
 
04:05:39.469 --> 04:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
creates such a disturbance to the
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
currents within the Gulf of Maine it
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
creates this cold water upwelling which
 
04:05:47.469 --> 04:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
is vital with for nutrients for the life
 
04:05:49.790 --> 04:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
of all the marine species that cashes
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
ledge supports now just east of cashes
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
ledge a budding cashis ledge is a 98,000
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
Acre Site which is designated for an
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
offshore Wind Farm now Cash's ledge
 
04:06:06.910 --> 04:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
contains the largest kelp forest on the
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
entire Eastern Seaboard kelp is far more
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
efficient at reducing or in carbon
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
sequestration than any Forest on land
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
but yet we're going to put an ocean
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
offshore wind site in the proximity of
 
04:06:25.229 --> 04:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
Cash's ledge to jeopardize this this
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
forest and all the marine life on there
 
04:06:30.750 --> 04:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
now the O the uh the turbines that'll be
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
out on the uh on the offshore sites
 
04:06:36.189 --> 04:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
they're a th000 feet tall their Blades
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
of 500 feet in diamer now these these
 
04:06:40.830 --> 04:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
blades and these propellers when they're
 
04:06:44.429 --> 04:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
working they create a wake of effect and
 
04:06:46.469 --> 04:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
this wake effect it disturbs the ocean
 
04:06:50.149 --> 04:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
currents and it also provides sediment
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
that blocks sunlight which prevents
 
04:06:55.229 --> 04:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
nutrition for getting into the bottom
 
04:06:58.269 --> 04:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
sea life so that's that's one of the
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
other issues um then we come to the
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
economic parts of this offshore wind is
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
50% more expensive than offshore wind
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
than onshore wind excuse me and the
 
04:07:14.149 --> 04:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
floating platforms are 22 more ex 22% %
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
higher in cost than the cost for a fixed
 
04:07:20.149 --> 04:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
monopile um
 
04:07:22.830 --> 04:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
Foundation the estimates to run the
 
04:07:25.469 --> 04:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
power cables ass sure are between five
 
04:07:28.750 --> 04:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
to7 million per mile and that's when you
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
have a relative uh flat bottom the Gulf
 
04:07:35.710 --> 04:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
of Maine is geologically comp complex
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
the most geologically complex bottom on
 
04:07:42.590 --> 04:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
the entire Eastern seab board now to run
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
cables are short to landfall from the
 
04:07:47.790 --> 04:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine is going to require a lot
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
of ups and downs through valleys through
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
basins through Peaks to ridges these are
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
all going to have to be covered with
 
04:07:57.750 --> 04:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
special concrete
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
blankets and these these blankets are
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
notice for shifting with ocean currents
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
and they chafe and the cables will
 
04:08:09.149 --> 04:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
chafe and so the cost for running cables
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
from offshore wind will be far more
 
04:08:12.750 --> 04:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
expensive than conventional offshore
 
04:08:15.389 --> 04:08:15.399 align:start position:0%
other offshore wind platforms the
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
vineyard wind power purchase agreement
 
04:08:23.790 --> 04:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
that came in at $74 per hour but they
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
are guaranteed annual rate increases for
 
04:08:30.670 --> 04:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
20 years after the operation begins on
 
04:08:34.030 --> 04:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
that wind farm so this thing about going
 
04:08:36.750 --> 04:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
to scale when you go to scale the cost
 
04:08:38.349 --> 04:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
should go down not when you have
 
04:08:40.349 --> 04:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
Guaranteed Rate increases for more than
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
20 years that's just totally ridiculous
 
04:08:47.550 --> 04:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm one final thought please I'm as
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
a member of the Yankee fisherman Co-op
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
and of 60 members we're urg this
 
04:08:54.510 --> 04:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
committee to support this house
 
04:08:58.109 --> 04:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
resolution to prevent uh offshore wind
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
from ever coming to the Gulf of main
 
04:09:00.640 --> 04:09:01.950 align:start position:0%
from ever coming to the Gulf of main
thank

04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:09:04.830 --> 04:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
you excellent testimony thank you
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
question of course I do um thank you
 
04:09:11.550 --> 04:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
chair and and thank you very much for
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
being here I was actually waiting for
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
for um the testifier from this um from
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
this uh uh document so um the Gulf of
 
04:09:22.830 --> 04:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
Maine goes from Nova Scotia to Cape Cod
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
correct well that's not my question so
 
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Maine goes from Nova Scotia
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
to Cape Cod that's considered the Gulf
 
04:09:33.469 --> 04:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
of Maine the Gulf of Maine right it's
 
04:09:37.349 --> 04:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
like rectangular area Okay so right now
 
04:09:39.910 --> 04:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Maine is warming at three
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
times faster than the global average and
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
and it is rising at 2.5 times faster in
 
04:09:50.590 --> 04:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
recent years than in the last century so
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
my question is is there already an
 
04:09:56.109 --> 04:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
impact to
 
04:09:59.229 --> 04:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
fishing and are you concerned about
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
these threats that are currently
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
happening in the Gulf well well just
 
04:10:06.710 --> 04:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
last year the um the deep water um
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
weathering bullies that are out there
 
04:10:10.269 --> 04:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
noticing extreme cold water upwelling
 
04:10:15.469 --> 04:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
developing in the Gulf of Maine
 
04:10:17.910 --> 04:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
scientists cannot explain what is going
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
on and why these cold water upwellings
 
04:10:24.070 --> 04:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
are coming so my my position is that
 
04:10:26.550 --> 04:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
maybe eventually that if these cold
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
water upwellings continue it may Pro it
 
04:10:32.109 --> 04:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
may slow down the heating of the uh the
 
04:10:37.030 --> 04:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine as for species uh impact
 
04:10:38.830 --> 04:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
um what I've seen the only thing I've
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
seen is catching in my traps lobster
 
04:10:44.189 --> 04:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
traps are species that probably
 
04:10:46.429 --> 04:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
not customarily caught around here like
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
black sea bass and trigger
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
fish thank you very
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
much uh representative n has a
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you and thank you for
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
being here today um I didn't know
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
anything about cash a ledge before so
 
04:11:04.750 --> 04:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
this is all new to me and since your
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
time was cut off I wondered if there was
 
04:11:08.830 --> 04:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
anything else that you wanted to tell us
 
04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
that you weren't able to until somebody
 
04:11:12.630 --> 04:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
asked you a question did I go into the
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Maine covers only 10% of the
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
total Atlantic Seaboard but yet it's
 
04:11:23.429 --> 04:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
responsible for 50% of all the fish that
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
Pro all the seafood that is landed on
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
the entire Atlantic Seaboard that's
 
04:11:29.710 --> 04:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
pretty amazing fact that 10% of your
 
04:11:32.269 --> 04:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
water is uh responsible for 50% of the
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
seafood that gets
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
landed that's a fascinating statistic
 
04:11:36.319 --> 04:11:38.349 align:start position:0%
landed that's a fascinating statistic
thank

04:11:38.349 --> 04:11:38.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:11:40.950 --> 04:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
you uh one other question from
 
04:11:43.950 --> 04:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative Swanson
 
04:11:47.710 --> 04:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr toon
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the uh representative Thomas
 
04:11:52.910 --> 04:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh this should be in
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
effect until uh there's an agreement or
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
understanding by the legislature that
 
04:12:00.109 --> 04:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
all the concerns of the fishing industry
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
have been addressed uh we've heard a
 
04:12:05.229 --> 04:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
number of different concerns and uh
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
probably maybe risk from a variety of s
 
04:12:11.950 --> 04:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
sources besides uh offshore wind but as
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
far as the offshore wind question
 
04:12:17.229 --> 04:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
there was an implication that you might
 
04:12:20.189 --> 04:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
reconsider opposition to Offshore wind
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
if somebody provides uh assurance that
 
04:12:26.149 --> 04:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
the risks that have been discussed are
 
04:12:30.990 --> 04:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
addressed and who would you uh accept as
 
04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
a an authority on providing that
 
04:12:35.349 --> 04:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
Assurance well you know these are
 
04:12:36.830 --> 04:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
offshore winds sites because of the
 
04:12:38.910 --> 04:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
propon of cables that are could be uh
 
04:12:41.229 --> 04:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
suspended in the water column and
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
because of the moing lines moing lines
 
04:12:45.389 --> 04:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
are generally 7 to1 ratio if you have
 
04:12:48.070 --> 04:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
1,000 ft of water you have to have 7,000
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
ft of moing scope the size of the chains
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
that are going to be holding these um
 
04:12:54.510 --> 04:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
turbines uh the one link is probably the
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
size of one of these tables and they're
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to be scouring the bottom and the
 
04:13:01.630 --> 04:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
other thing is these because of the
 
04:13:03.750 --> 04:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
floating nature of these and the
 
04:13:07.149 --> 04:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
suspended cables these these uh wind
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
farms are going to likely to be full
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
exclusion zones meaning that you won't
 
04:13:12.830 --> 04:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
be able to navigate through these uh
 
04:13:16.109 --> 04:13:16.119 align:start position:0%
wind Farms so if you're out 25 30 miles
 
04:13:17.469 --> 04:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
Beyond then you got to get in because
 
04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
the weather's getting bad you're going
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
to have to circumnavigate around the
 
04:13:22.990 --> 04:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
wind farm and put yourself in more
 
04:13:24.910 --> 04:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy just to get get to shore
 
04:13:27.870 --> 04:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
because you cannot navigate through a
 
04:13:30.109 --> 04:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
floating offshore wind farm so follow-up
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
question followup is there
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh any situation or condition then
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
you're I I think I hear are you saying
 
04:13:40.349 --> 04:13:40.359 align:start position:0%
then that there's no condition or
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
description that you would accept well
 
04:13:46.389 --> 04:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
I'm my my major concern is the pristine
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
environment of the of the Gulf of Maine
 
04:13:53.149 --> 04:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
in Jeopardy of producing necessary food
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
because I believe the Gulf of Maine is
 
04:13:59.429 --> 04:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
Cap capable of producing food that's
 
04:14:01.229 --> 04:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
more valuable than any electricity that
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.680 --> 04:14:05.309 align:start position:0%
 
produced

04:14:05.309 --> 04:14:05.319 align:start position:0%
produced
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
okay so you know further questions I
 
04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for your testimony and
 
04:14:17.070 --> 04:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
welcome back again thank you Mr shairon
 
04:14:21.149 --> 04:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the chance to speak with
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
you um for the record my name is Lisa
 
04:14:26.510 --> 04:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
lenos and my I'm going to speak in
 
04:14:30.510 --> 04:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
support of HR HCR for and before I get
 
04:14:32.429 --> 04:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
started I wanted to comment to
 
04:14:34.429 --> 04:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington the state of
 
04:14:36.349 --> 04:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does have full authority
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
to stop an onshoring transmission line
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
that and that in New Hampshire will be
 
04:14:43.750 --> 04:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
done through the side evaluation
 
04:14:45.389 --> 04:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
committee but in other states like New
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
Jersey at one time it was the before
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
they took their right away it would have
 
04:14:51.429 --> 04:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
been local rule to stop
 
04:14:55.710 --> 04:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
it um the point I want to make most
 
04:14:57.510 --> 04:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
important is that the we've heard from
 
04:15:00.590 --> 04:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
the fishermen and I want you to hear
 
04:15:03.710 --> 04:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
this issue around uh what bom has said
 
04:15:05.710 --> 04:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of the impact to the fishing
 
04:15:08.429 --> 04:15:08.439 align:start position:0%
industry and these are this is the same
 
04:15:10.109 --> 04:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
comment that they made with regard to
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
the vineyard wind project the revolution
 
04:15:15.550 --> 04:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
wi project and also the CV Coastal
 
04:15:18.910 --> 04:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
Virginia wind offshore wind project
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's happening off the coast of
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
Virginia they stated in their uh
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statements that the
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
impact on fishing would be negligible
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
commercial fishing would be negligible
 
04:15:34.750 --> 04:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
to Major meaning that the actual impact
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
is uncertain and depends on evolving
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
factors like how fish populations
 
04:15:42.429 --> 04:15:42.439 align:start position:0%
respond how the industry adapts and
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
whether ation efforts succeed it also
 
04:15:47.229 --> 04:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
means that while some areas and
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders might experience minimal
 
04:15:52.349 --> 04:15:52.359 align:start position:0%
disruption others might face severe
 
04:15:55.229 --> 04:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
consequences that's how bom has left it
 
04:15:57.550 --> 04:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
so there is this point to the question
 
04:15:59.550 --> 04:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
of whether or not what if you can be
 
04:16:02.030 --> 04:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
assured there is no way they're going to
 
04:16:04.389 --> 04:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
be assuring that the fishing industry
 
04:16:06.670 --> 04:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
would survive offshore wind development
 
04:16:10.229 --> 04:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
as it's happening to reduce the major
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
adverse finding to minor are negligible
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
which is the process that they have to
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
go through in order to approve these
 
04:16:20.429 --> 04:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
construction and operation plans bom has
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
bom is now requiring developers to
 
04:16:25.790 --> 04:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
provide compensatory mitigation meaning
 
04:16:29.070 --> 04:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
fishermen will be rece receiving funding
 
04:16:31.790 --> 04:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
to cover their revenue losses so in
 
04:16:34.149 --> 04:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
effect they are they are proposing and
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
have established that this will be the
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
case you will be if you're not able to
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
secure the same level of yield that you
 
04:16:43.349 --> 04:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
were before or perhaps not be a to fish
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
at all we will pay you to compensate you
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
that means that they won't be fishing
 
04:16:53.630 --> 04:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
that means the fishing industry will die
 
04:16:55.710 --> 04:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
the extent to which it will happen we
 
04:16:57.309 --> 04:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
don't know but the listening to the
 
04:16:59.790 --> 04:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
fishermen it might be quite
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
severe um there was one other point the
 
04:17:07.590 --> 04:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
um the I have I'm going to be emailing
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
my comments to you but in the comments I
 
04:17:12.910 --> 04:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
also list the staff comments from the
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
staff report for the coastal Resource
 
04:17:17.590 --> 04:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
Management Council which in Rhode Island
 
04:17:20.109 --> 04:17:20.119 align:start position:0%
which is the entity responsible for the
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
consistency review that I spoke about in
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
my prior testimony they say a number of
 
04:17:25.630 --> 04:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
things about the impacts of the
 
04:17:27.389 --> 04:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
fishermen but I will just read one of
 
04:17:29.870 --> 04:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
them and that is overall this is a
 
04:17:32.429 --> 04:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
direct quote there will likely be a net
 
04:17:34.510 --> 04:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
loss to existing Rhode Island based
 
04:17:36.710 --> 04:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
Marine businesses who either directly or
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
indirectly profit from the fish fishery
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
resources located with within the
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
proposed Revolution when project which
 
04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
is one of the projects off the coast so
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
that that is one area I think it's very
 
04:17:52.269 --> 04:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
serious problem that is not well exposed
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
other other point I want to make is orad
 
04:17:56.670 --> 04:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
AOS which is one of the largest
 
04:17:58.349 --> 04:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
developers from Denmark they're
 
04:18:00.070 --> 04:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
developing projects off the coast of New
 
04:18:02.149 --> 04:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
England has stated in public
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
presentations that offshore wind will
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
likely reduce tourism re revenues for an
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
area by 15% annually in 2023 tourism
 
04:18:13.469 --> 04:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
related spending in Hampshire which
 
04:18:17.469 --> 04:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
includes ocean tourism reached $2.4
 
04:18:19.870 --> 04:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
billion I don't know what percentage of
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
that represents ocean tourism but if
 
04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
just onethird of that Revenue came from
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
Ocean tourists this could impact as much
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
as $120 million in revenues annually for
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
the life of the project and we know that
 
04:18:35.149 --> 04:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
our coastal towns if they're like most
 
04:18:36.990 --> 04:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
coastal towns they make most of their
 
04:18:39.790 --> 04:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
revenue during the summer period when
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
when re when um visitors come okay make
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
your final Point okay final point with
 
04:18:48.269 --> 04:18:48.279 align:start position:0%
regard to Offshore wind and climate
 
04:18:50.830 --> 04:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
change and climate risk according to bom
 
04:18:53.109 --> 04:18:53.119 align:start position:0%
us offshore wind projects would be by
 
04:18:56.109 --> 04:18:56.119 align:start position:0%
themselves will have a limited impact on
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
global emissions and climate change
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
bom Point Blank says the impact of these
 
04:19:04.149 --> 04:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
projects not just one but all of them
 
04:19:06.149 --> 04:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
will not reduce climate change and the
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
reason they're mainly being built is to
 
04:19:09.670 --> 04:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
meet the the mandates that have been
 
04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
established in the states thank you
 
04:19:16.830 --> 04:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions for miss
 
04:19:20.429 --> 04:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
lenos seeing none want to thank you for
 
04:19:24.750 --> 04:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
that excellent testimony next up is Ward
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:37.710 --> 04:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
burn uh thank you again I'm Ward burn
 
04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
Captain owner of the fishing vessel
 
04:19:41.229 --> 04:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
sugar daddy based out of pors New
 
04:19:43.630 --> 04:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would like to put out uh
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
point out today that the
 
04:19:49.070 --> 04:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh the senator that was in charge of the
 
04:19:50.910 --> 04:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
wind commission is absent today and that
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
would be Senate Senator Waters he's not
 
04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
here um I would like to point out that
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
the nature conservancy
 
04:20:02.550 --> 04:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
foundation and
 
04:20:05.229 --> 04:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
um conservative Conservancy law
 
04:20:08.750 --> 04:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
Foundation both receive funds from from
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
the wind companies and they made
 
04:20:13.750 --> 04:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier so it it doesn't
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
appear that it's we're on a fair playing
 
04:20:17.590 --> 04:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
field here when we have people that are
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
getting paid to testify and I'm here
 
04:20:22.750 --> 04:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:25.990 --> 04:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
pay there was never a vote in the
 
04:20:27.950 --> 04:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
several well several years of the win
 
04:20:30.510 --> 04:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
Commission in favor of this never one
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
vote taken in all of our time we've
 
04:20:35.590 --> 04:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
never took a vote to vote on it anything
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
it was always a discussion and the
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
fisherman were as Eric said earlier we
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:48.630 --> 04:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
years um I would like to comment on
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
something the the intent of this bill
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
and um the intent is to help Maine and
 
04:20:58.870 --> 04:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts well Massachusetts New
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Maine fisherman are united
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
and we stand together and we do not want
 
04:21:06.750 --> 04:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
wind we know it's an ocean killer I've
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
explained to you the cooland stations
 
04:21:12.349 --> 04:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to I'll I'll leave it with
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
this with
 
04:21:17.790 --> 04:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
you um it's it's unfathomable for me to
 
04:21:20.590 --> 04:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
be a steward of the ocean and sit here
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
and we talk about money and cost and
 
04:21:24.910 --> 04:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
rates and we're not even really
 
04:21:26.910 --> 04:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
discussing the health of our ocean and
 
04:21:28.990 --> 04:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
what this is going to do to it if we
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
kill that ocean we won't have to worry
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
about electricity we're going to have
 
04:21:34.910 --> 04:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
much bigger problems it's a fragile
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
ecosystem that needs to be treated as
 
04:21:40.269 --> 04:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
such we are highly regulated by the
 
04:21:42.910 --> 04:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
government to take care of our ocean and
 
04:21:45.109 --> 04:21:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're proud to be stewards of the ocean
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know one fisherman that doesn't
 
04:21:49.389 --> 04:21:49.399 align:start position:0%
go to work put his boots on jump on his
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
boat and love what he does and what we
 
04:21:55.349 --> 04:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
do is feed people we're Farmers we like
 
04:21:58.590 --> 04:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
feeding people thank
 
04:22:00.750 --> 04:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
you oh and representative Wendy Thomas
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
has a question for you thank you uh
 
04:22:08.670 --> 04:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
chair and and thank you for being here
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand the
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
fishing industry so in your your boat is
 
04:22:15.710 --> 04:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
sugar daddy that's not my question um
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
but with your boat do you go out further
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
than three miles do you go into
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
international waters I do if I'm
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee has a question
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for taking my question
 
04:22:35.189 --> 04:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here too and for the
 
04:22:39.070 --> 04:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
work that you do um I think you know we
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh we all have similar uh goals in that
 
04:22:45.510 --> 04:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
we want to protect and preserve our
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
Waters and our natural resources for
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
sure um and I think
 
04:22:53.429 --> 04:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh some of the testimony that you've
 
04:22:55.590 --> 04:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
given us today I went to look up I
 
04:22:57.309 --> 04:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't doing other things on my computer
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
I was kind of looking up things that
 
04:23:01.550 --> 04:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
have been said and what I wanted to look
 
04:23:03.389 --> 04:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
up particularly was the idea that
 
04:23:05.070 --> 04:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
chlorine was being released into the
 
04:23:06.590 --> 04:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
water and that it might be bleaching or
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
changing the chemistry and hurting um
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
sea uh animals and
 
04:23:14.510 --> 04:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
the all the answers that I've gotten are
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
that that that no floating wind turbines
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
do not release chlorine into the ocean
 
04:23:23.109 --> 04:23:23.119 align:start position:0%
that they don't use um the ocean water
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
in order to circulate to cool the
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
turbines or anything like that so I
 
04:23:27.950 --> 04:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to find anything that
 
04:23:30.030 --> 04:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
actually corroborates that you're
 
04:23:32.349 --> 04:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
correct the turbines themselves don't
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
use the ocean water the cooling stations
 
04:23:39.790 --> 04:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
halfway between the windmill and
 
04:23:43.710 --> 04:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
the uh and land and they need cooling
 
04:23:45.790 --> 04:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
stations to switch it from AC to DC
 
04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
power and they're going to take in
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
seawater off off the ocean floor they're
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to chlorinate it to prevent fing
 
04:23:54.109 --> 04:23:54.119 align:start position:0%
in the equipment and when it's
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
discharged it'll be between 86 and 90
 
04:23:58.750 --> 04:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
degrees I call it 90 because I'm I'm
 
04:24:02.349 --> 04:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
sore about the whole subject but um and
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
they disat it back into the ocean at the
 
04:24:07.630 --> 04:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
tune of 8.1 gallon million gallons a day
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
at 40% load now also I left out on my
 
04:24:14.349 --> 04:24:14.359 align:start position:0%
last testimony that if they get the
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
whole wind array they don't need just
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
one cooling station they need
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
32 that's where the 280 million gallons
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
of chlorinated heated seawater comes
 
04:24:27.790 --> 04:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
from at 100% load it's 333 million
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
gallons a day and uh I don't have the
 
04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
actual wording I wrote it down but I
 
04:24:36.630 --> 04:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
can't find it but my good friend over
 
04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
here Jerry has the appendix on where to
 
04:24:39.479 --> 04:24:42.750 align:start position:0%
here Jerry has the appendix on where to
Sunrise

04:24:42.750 --> 04:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.760 --> 04:24:44.750 align:start position:0%
 
Sunrise

04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
Sunrise
 
04:24:48.269 --> 04:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
appendix and two wrot that down earlier
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
you you will find the uh use of chlorine
 
04:24:54.149 --> 04:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh dumped into the ocean and I mean it
 
04:24:58.229 --> 04:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know I'm a fisherman I I'm
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
not a rocket scientist or anything like
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
that but I know well enough to know
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to be really
 
04:25:06.910 --> 04:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
bad so thank you for clarifying that Mr
 
04:25:10.109 --> 04:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
chair um can I speak just one yes so
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's the cooling stations we should be
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
looking at to try try and figure out it
 
04:25:14.750 --> 04:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
basically sounds like as the energy
 
04:25:16.389 --> 04:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
comes from the wind turbine it needs to
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
be it needs to be what would the word be
 
04:25:23.389 --> 04:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
um conditioned uh in order to take the
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
current to the what you need when it
 
04:25:26.590 --> 04:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
gets on Shore so there's a like a way
 
04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
station in between that they look like a
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
put your an oil rig that's what they
 
04:25:34.349 --> 04:25:34.359 align:start position:0%
look like on a Model that I've seen and
 
04:25:36.269 --> 04:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
it it looks like an oil rig only it's a
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
cooling station to cool down the sea
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
water cuz when they switch from AC to DC
 
04:25:45.590 --> 04:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
power it Ates heat so as they pitch of
 
04:25:47.630 --> 04:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
water flowing through a pipe it's like
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
electricity is flowing through the wire
 
04:25:51.229 --> 04:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
and when it get so far and they have to
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
switch over it creates heat so that and
 
04:25:58.510 --> 04:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
part of this is a result of these are
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
they're not they're experimental
 
04:26:03.429 --> 04:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
floating wind wind farms this isn't this
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
is the first in our country this is the
 
04:26:07.710 --> 04:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
first time we're experimenting with this
 
04:26:11.309 --> 04:26:11.319 align:start position:0%
type of technology in our ocean and um
 
04:26:13.790 --> 04:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
and I like I've said for that we use
 
04:26:16.429 --> 04:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
their data this we didn't dream this up
 
04:26:20.189 --> 04:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
material okay additional
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we'll move next to
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:40.870 --> 04:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
FSA thank you Mr chair fellow committee
 
04:26:44.510 --> 04:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
members um little background before I
 
04:26:44.520 --> 04:26:45.469 align:start position:0%
members um little background before I
created

04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
created
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
nepsa I right out of high school I
 
04:26:50.189 --> 04:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
started offshore trolling out of
 
04:26:53.590 --> 04:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
Portland Maine then from there 7 years
 
04:26:55.950 --> 04:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
later I ended up in Boston Massachusetts
 
04:26:57.910 --> 04:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
5 years after that in Gloucester
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and near the end of my
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
career before creating nea I ended up in
 
04:27:03.550 --> 04:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
New Bedford Mass I have covered
 
04:27:05.710 --> 04:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
everything from the Bay of Fundy across
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
the EZ line across the northern edge of
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
Georgia's Banks down to the Canyons
 
04:27:11.790 --> 04:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
Georgia's Canyons specifically all the
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
way back to the west of the Hudson
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
Canyon down below the south end of
 
04:27:16.830 --> 04:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I've towed over well over
 
04:27:18.710 --> 04:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
a half million miles of bottom I spent
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
16 and 1 12 years at sea fishing around
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
the clock in the last
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
23 we have logical Baseline studies
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
showing catch averages using the same
 
04:27:32.630 --> 04:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
codend size over two decades the numbers
 
04:27:35.790 --> 04:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
have gone up what was told to you today
 
04:27:37.710 --> 04:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
about the Cash's ledge well there's also
 
04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
the Jeff's ledge closure which restricts
 
04:27:42.189 --> 04:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
access to a lot of commercial trollers
 
04:27:44.070 --> 04:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
so when we start taking up large SLO of
 
04:27:46.670 --> 04:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
our water we are fundamentally moving
 
04:27:48.429 --> 04:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
fishing pattern efforts while the
 
04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
management of our Fisheries are in
 
04:27:52.990 --> 04:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
regions the fish do not know there are
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
borders we could be misad redirecting
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
keynote Forge stocks those Forge stocks
 
04:28:01.710 --> 04:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
are what helps the vitility of the
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
rebundle have not little to know
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
research on we're still looking at noise
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
I mean we're building out right now on
 
04:28:16.590 --> 04:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
fixed platforms down off South of uh
 
04:28:18.389 --> 04:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts these are floating
 
04:28:20.550 --> 04:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
turbines projected for the Gulf of main
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
as was said the anchoring chains are
 
04:28:25.149 --> 04:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
projected between 7 to1 and 9 to1
 
04:28:28.870 --> 04:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
scoping well 700 ft of water average
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
well that's 4,900 ft time 3 so now
 
04:28:35.469 --> 04:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
you're talking what 13,700 ft of chain
 
04:28:39.109 --> 04:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
per turbine the ocdc converters are what
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
the cooling stations are called from the
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
sunrise wind PR appendex N2 and on our
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
website NE fisherman with an e.org we
 
04:28:50.990 --> 04:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
also have documents showing you know
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
these peer-reviewed Sciences talking
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
about these things we have a cooling
 
04:28:57.109 --> 04:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
station report same thing with a lobster
 
04:29:00.750 --> 04:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
report same thing with alisandra Cressy
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
is a scientist out of Norway the Norway
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
acoustic study they did lab testing
 
04:29:08.030 --> 04:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
showing that 100 htz noise produced by
 
04:29:10.510 --> 04:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
floating turbines in the labs actually
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
called in juvenile cfish larvey well we
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
also know through the science center
 
04:29:17.149 --> 04:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
that Alo branches like sharks and skates
 
04:29:19.630 --> 04:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
are attracted in some nuances to EMF
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
fields which would put that larv into
 
04:29:24.429 --> 04:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
predation because the same studies also
 
04:29:26.830 --> 04:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
show when hattic larv were introduced to
 
04:29:29.710 --> 04:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
EMF it slowed the swimming rate well
 
04:29:31.950 --> 04:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
when fish and lobsters don't swim that
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
puts them into higher predation
 
04:29:35.710 --> 04:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
everything in the ocean was designed to
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
eat something else 98% of everything
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
born was designed to Die the 2% is what
 
04:29:43.950 --> 04:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
causes the re occurrence of the stocks
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
we have not done enough field study yet
 
04:29:47.950 --> 04:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
or over enough time to figure out what
 
04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
the next steps are again that's why we
 
04:29:51.710 --> 04:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
say if you don't know where you are you
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't know where you're going but we're
 
04:29:55.309 --> 04:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
projecting millions of dollars of money
 
04:29:58.189 --> 04:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
and billions actually you know on on
 
04:30:01.389 --> 04:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
unvetted technology high wind Tempest
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
again is the only floating turbines out
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
of the United Kingdom they use a
 
04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
four-part anchoring system we about
 
04:30:09.550 --> 04:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
producing three-part anchoring systems
 
04:30:10.750 --> 04:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
well we don't know which design we're
 
04:30:12.309 --> 04:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
going to use because again it's not
 
04:30:15.990 --> 04:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
vetted technology one last point please
 
04:30:20.510 --> 04:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
I am very strongly uh for this
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
amendment uh again no fisherman in Maine
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or Massachusetts out of
 
04:30:28.109 --> 04:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
the thousands that I've interacted with
 
04:30:30.990 --> 04:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
over three years agree with this and we
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
our voices have not been heard and this
 
04:30:34.469 --> 04:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
is a good time for New Hampshire to take
 
04:30:37.550 --> 04:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
the lead and show a good strong
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
standpoint not just for your state but
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
for the nation thank you
 
04:30:46.030 --> 04:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
okay well said all right no
 
04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
questions uh for that gentleman so now
 
04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
we'll call on cowo Kelly and Miss Kelly
 
04:30:57.670 --> 04:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
please talk about the resolution not the
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
threat that China poses to the
 
04:31:04.830 --> 04:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
world thank you Mr chairman um yes I am
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
for the resolution and like I said
 
04:31:10.109 --> 04:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
earlier I'm from Vietnam and I know that
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
the quality of the seafood here away
 
04:31:14.590 --> 04:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
when I still eating the food and my I
 
04:31:18.189 --> 04:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
still go shopping for my family so the
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
quality is different from the imported
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
product Seafoods and the food from other
 
04:31:25.710 --> 04:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
country especially from Vietnam that I
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
know so if the fishing industry is gone
 
04:31:33.550 --> 04:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
we are stuck with imported products and
 
04:31:36.510 --> 04:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
in Vietnam most of their Farm including
 
04:31:39.070 --> 04:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
sea farms and fish farms and all that
 
04:31:42.030 --> 04:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
are affected by Chinese chemicals and
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
they they have a farm that they just
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
sell and they have a farm for their
 
04:31:48.790 --> 04:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
family to eat and we are stuck with the
 
04:31:51.670 --> 04:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
imported products that to sell not for
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
the family consumes that's affecting all
 
04:31:57.189 --> 04:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
of our health and I hear a lot from the
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
fishing industry but not enough voice to
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
protect the consumer protection like us
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
because most of us are busy working to
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
pay bills especially grocery bills my
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
grocery bills go 100% up since 2021 so
 
04:32:13.950 --> 04:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
I'm to you all suffering the same pain
 
04:32:16.349 --> 04:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
but hopefully some voice to protect a
 
04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
consumer like us and our health and our
 
04:32:21.710 --> 04:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
future thank you and and please support
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
this bill uh this resolution thank you
 
04:32:27.630 --> 04:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Kelly appreciate you
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
being here next up is Meredith Hatfield
 
04:32:37.149 --> 04:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
Conservancy thank you good afternoon
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield from nature
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
conservancy um I filed a letter on the
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
prior bill that also covers this bill I
 
04:32:46.910 --> 04:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't intending to to
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
testify um but
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh one of the prior
 
04:32:53.070 --> 04:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
speakers stated that we receive funding
 
04:32:54.670 --> 04:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
from the offshore wind industry and I
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
felt the need to just say that that is
 
04:32:58.349 --> 04:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
not true thank
 
04:33:01.750 --> 04:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
you thanks for clarifying
 
04:33:05.230 --> 04:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
that okay last word on this um
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
resolution goes to John Gage of wind
 
04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
Windam and Mr Gage earlier in your test
 
04:33:13.470 --> 04:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
testimony on a different bill you held
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
up a placard that's a violation of house
 
04:33:17.949 --> 04:33:17.959 align:start position:0%
rules so please don't do that again oh
 
04:33:19.750 --> 04:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
sorry it was just a web address I didn't
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
know if
 
04:33:24.830 --> 04:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
I could speak it clearly enough um so
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
chairman I oppose this bill
 
04:33:33.310 --> 04:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
um I'd like you to if you would call the
 
04:33:37.070 --> 04:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
um public online testimony the last two
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
previous bills were strongly favored or
 
04:33:43.830 --> 04:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed by the public 30 to 163
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
and 40 to 175 um I don't know what this
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
one is but it would be nice to know how
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
the public weighs in um fishermen know
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
their business best um well I think
 
04:33:57.551 --> 04:33:57.561 align:start position:0%
that's true they know where to get the
 
04:34:00.709 --> 04:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
fish um but we do see that over fishing
 
04:34:04.349 --> 04:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes happens and I don't know if
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
global warming is on the minds of
 
04:34:09.310 --> 04:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
anybody when they're headed out to see
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh they've got a lot more
 
04:34:11.160 --> 04:34:12.910 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh they've got a lot more
important

04:34:12.910 --> 04:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:34:16.349 --> 04:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
shortterm things to worry about uh but
 
04:34:18.869 --> 04:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
this is from the National Climate
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
assessment that came out a couple years
 
04:34:23.429 --> 04:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
ago across the globe climate change is
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
altering marine ecosystems and connected
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
social systems at a scale and Pace that
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
is unprecedented in recent Millennia the
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
combination of long-term changes in
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
physical ocean conditions such as
 
04:34:38.590 --> 04:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
warming sea ice loss acidification and
 
04:34:40.670 --> 04:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
deoxygenation and short-term extreme
 
04:34:42.670 --> 04:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
events such as Marine heat waves
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
threaten marine ecosystems and human
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
communities numerous marine species from
 
04:34:50.029 --> 04:34:50.039 align:start position:0%
phytoplankton to whales are altering
 
04:34:52.269 --> 04:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
their distribution seasonal activities
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
and behaviors to align with suitable
 
04:34:56.830 --> 04:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
ocean conditions these changes Ripple
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
through the food web affecting species
 
04:35:01.390 --> 04:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
interactions ecosystem functions and
 
04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
biodiversity as well as conservation
 
04:35:07.150 --> 04:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
management and uses of valuable ocean
 
04:35:10.470 --> 04:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
resources um a lot of fishing happens up
 
04:35:13.470 --> 04:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
here now because fishermen in the South
 
04:35:15.709 --> 04:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh in the Carolinas they used to find
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
species offshore are coming up here now
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
to fish because as the water's warm
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.590 --> 04:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
word uh so representative Khan said he
 
04:35:34.510 --> 04:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
wants to leave New Hampshire better for
 
04:35:37.150 --> 04:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
our children I think all of us do and I
 
04:35:39.390 --> 04:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
think it's important for us to
 
04:35:41.830 --> 04:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
understand that every energy source has
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
um problems um but an energy diverse New
 
04:35:48.869 --> 04:35:48.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a more resilient Reliant um
 
04:35:51.470 --> 04:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
independent New Hampshire so I really
 
04:35:53.830 --> 04:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
think you should oppose this number
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
three bill today on the war on wind
 
04:35:58.510 --> 04:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
power thank
 
04:36:01.750 --> 04:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you and with that being the
 
04:36:06.269 --> 04:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
last pink card for HCR 4 we will close
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
that public hearing and we will open a
 
04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 219 F relative to
 
04:36:15.789 --> 04:36:15.799 align:start position:0%
the phasing out of the minimum electric
 
04:36:18.789 --> 04:36:18.799 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and I'll
 
04:36:22.470 --> 04:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
call Representative Michael Harrington
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill to
 
04:36:30.670 --> 04:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
legislation while representative
 
04:36:34.949 --> 04:36:34.959 align:start position:0%
Harington is making his way forward I
 
04:36:37.750 --> 04:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
will point out that I already have 19
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
pink cards for this bill
 
04:36:47.150 --> 04:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
so we will probably have to uh
 
04:36:54.429 --> 04:36:54.439 align:start position:0%
suspend the public hearing on these two
 
04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
date which is unfortunate representative
 
04:37:08.109 --> 04:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
Harrington go ahead and introduce this
 
04:37:10.150 --> 04:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Mr chairman my
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
name is Michael Harrington I'm represent
 
04:37:14.349 --> 04:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
present straford district 18 I refer to
 
04:37:16.349 --> 04:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
this bill as the New Hampshire rate
 
04:37:18.990 --> 04:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
payers are not stupid act because that's
 
04:37:21.310 --> 04:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
basically what it's what it's saying uh
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
we started out some years ago with the
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
idea that we had to subsidize renewable
 
04:37:26.949 --> 04:37:26.959 align:start position:0%
energy to get it up on its feet and
 
04:37:30.029 --> 04:37:30.039 align:start position:0%
running we were made promises that after
 
04:37:31.789 --> 04:37:31.799 align:start position:0%
a while they wouldn't need the subsidies
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
it'll be so much cheaper when we build a
 
04:37:36.150 --> 04:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
lot of it that people will voluntarily
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
buy it well we can go back and look a
 
04:37:40.830 --> 04:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
like a little bit what people would
 
04:37:43.629 --> 04:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
voluntarily do when I was on the uh
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission there was
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually a law in place that was now
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's been suspended that said the
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
utilities would have to provide up to
 
04:37:53.709 --> 04:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
including 100% Renewable Power to
 
04:37:55.510 --> 04:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
anybody who wanted it but they would
 
04:37:57.310 --> 04:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
have to collect the cost from the people
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
who wanted it so if you wanted renewable
 
04:38:01.150 --> 04:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
energy and you willing to pay for it you
 
04:38:02.830 --> 04:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
could get renewable energy this bill
 
04:38:06.029 --> 04:38:06.039 align:start position:0%
reinstates that provision of course when
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
people were given the option as to
 
04:38:09.551 --> 04:38:09.561 align:start position:0%
whether or not to purchase renewable
 
04:38:13.230 --> 04:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
energy less than 1% of the rate payers
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
opted to do that so because the
 
04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
administrative costs were so high again
 
04:38:21.390 --> 04:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
0.1% administrative cost was so high
 
04:38:23.349 --> 04:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
associated with it the utilities said
 
04:38:25.109 --> 04:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
can we suspend this nobody's using it
 
04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
and the Pu granted that wish so now the
 
04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
years have gone by we've had all the
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
startups come and gone they've got huge
 
04:38:36.150 --> 04:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
amounts of this being built and the rate
 
04:38:38.269 --> 04:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
payer the subsidies are still there and
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
this would simply phase out the the
 
04:38:42.910 --> 04:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
subsidies over a 5year period now people
 
04:38:44.070 --> 04:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
are going to say well that's going to be
 
04:38:46.029 --> 04:38:46.039 align:start position:0%
bad for my business well there was never
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
a promise made in that original Bill no
 
04:38:50.070 --> 04:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
one ever sat here and said you're going
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
to be subsidized forever as with any
 
04:38:54.789 --> 04:38:54.799 align:start position:0%
government program you take your risk
 
04:38:56.310 --> 04:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
that it could be discontinued in the
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
future this is simply a handout program
 
04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing that would stop
 
04:39:02.709 --> 04:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to buy Renewable Power
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
for the devolved service from from doing
 
04:39:07.949 --> 04:39:07.959 align:start position:0%
it um it simply says if you choose not
 
04:39:09.990 --> 04:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
to then you don't have to subsidize
 
04:39:12.390 --> 04:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
Renewable Power so and people are going
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
to talk about oh it's creating jobs here
 
04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
and jobs there well how much are they
 
04:39:17.830 --> 04:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
willing to pay out of their pocket to
 
04:39:19.830 --> 04:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
create some job that somebody else does
 
04:39:21.869 --> 04:39:21.879 align:start position:0%
that no one's willing to pay for because
 
04:39:24.269 --> 04:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
if people want to have this product they
 
04:39:27.670 --> 04:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
will buy it and I think that the the
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
concept that was uh at least somewhat
 
04:39:32.230 --> 04:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
presented in the past was well people
 
04:39:34.910 --> 04:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't aren aware of global warming and
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
climate change and all this um you'd
 
04:39:39.390 --> 04:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
have to be literally living in a hole in
 
04:39:40.830 --> 04:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
the ground not to hear about global
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
warming and climate change we are
 
04:39:44.910 --> 04:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
inundated with it constantly every place
 
04:39:47.230 --> 04:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
you go I mean the Patriots lose it's due
 
04:39:49.470 --> 04:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
to global warming uh it speaks about
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
everything you can think of that happens
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
is blamed on global warming no one is
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
ignorant of the fact of that opinion
 
04:39:57.470 --> 04:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
anyways on global warming and now people
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
can make a choice that's all this does
 
04:40:01.788 --> 04:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
it says should the state be ones to say
 
04:40:03.550 --> 04:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
you're not smart enough to decide what
 
04:40:05.708 --> 04:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
type of electricity to make even though
 
04:40:08.350 --> 04:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
you've been inundated for years over the
 
04:40:09.990 --> 04:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
threats of global warming and how bad
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
and horrible it's going to be you if
 
04:40:13.390 --> 04:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
give them the freedom to make a choice
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
will make the wrong choice so we're
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to force you to buy electricity at
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
a higher cost that you don't want to buy
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
and that's simply what the bill says no
 
04:40:22.708 --> 04:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do that anymore we
 
04:40:24.910 --> 04:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
don't stop instantaneously because give
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
people a chance to plan it's a five-year
 
04:40:28.948 --> 04:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
phase out so that 5 years after
 
04:40:30.510 --> 04:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of the bill the renewable
 
04:40:32.750 --> 04:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard will no longer exist
 
04:40:34.590 --> 04:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
and everyone will produce uh electricity
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
on a Level Playing Field and people can
 
04:40:38.590 --> 04:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
choose they want renewable they don't
 
04:40:40.350 --> 04:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
want renewable if they want wind if you
 
04:40:42.430 --> 04:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
go to the Pu website now there's some
 
04:40:43.948 --> 04:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
people that sell all wind I'm sure
 
04:40:45.550 --> 04:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
there's others could come up that do
 
04:40:48.030 --> 04:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
similar ones like that so that's what it
 
04:40:52.430 --> 04:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.750 --> 04:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay questions for
 
04:40:56.628 --> 04:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington representative
 
04:40:58.990 --> 04:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington for taking
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
my question we've seen this bill before
 
04:41:06.750 --> 04:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
um and I understand uh the aims of the
 
04:41:09.628 --> 04:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
bill I guess the question I have is if
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
there is any economic impact information
 
04:41:15.550 --> 04:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
that we've collected to understand what
 
04:41:19.390 --> 04:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
it will do um to existing businesses and
 
04:41:22.310 --> 04:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
existing markets and the competitive
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
energy Market if a bill like this uh
 
04:41:28.110 --> 04:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
goes through do do we have any
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of what kind of economic
 
04:41:32.910 --> 04:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
impacts this bill would result in well I
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
don't have a specific number but I can
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
say that there's generally a
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of economic impacts
 
04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
because it seems to be an opinion that
 
04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
if the government collects $100 from a
 
04:41:47.430 --> 04:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
th000 people and then spends 80,000 of
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
that on some project and 20,000 on
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
overhead cost that is more effective at
 
04:41:54.628 --> 04:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
creating jobs than the Private Industry
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
would I my contention is you left
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
$100,000 in the hand of individuals to
 
04:42:00.030 --> 04:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
make their own choice they're going to
 
04:42:01.830 --> 04:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
make a better choice than the government
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
so the fact yeah is there going to be
 
04:42:05.708 --> 04:42:05.718 align:start position:0%
some economic impact on it probably if
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
they can't produce on par with other
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
sources some of these renewable uh
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
plants will go out of business
 
04:42:13.510 --> 04:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean the money is being
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
torn up and thrown down the toilet it
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
means people get to retain their money
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
and spend it a different way that will
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
create businesses probably more jobs
 
04:42:23.550 --> 04:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
than would be created by government
 
04:42:27.390 --> 04:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
subsidize followup so um since it's an
 
04:42:33.670 --> 04:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
existing program
 
04:42:39.550 --> 04:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh it you mentioned in your intro that
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know government impos this you
 
04:42:44.110 --> 04:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
didn't couple it with the reason we were
 
04:42:46.750 --> 04:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
doing it which was to try and incent you
 
04:42:49.270 --> 04:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
know fuel diversity and clean energy
 
04:42:52.510 --> 04:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
sources and so all the value uh that we
 
04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
were trying to attain by having this
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
program are also still there and those
 
04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
were not part of your testimony so can
 
04:43:03.230 --> 04:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
you say something about uh how this my
 
04:43:06.150 --> 04:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
impression is that this would just um
 
04:43:07.948 --> 04:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
sort of pull up the rein on the
 
04:43:11.550 --> 04:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
economics of these Investments and would
 
04:43:14.270 --> 04:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
really change the energy landscape such
 
04:43:17.910 --> 04:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
that we would have less fuel diversity
 
04:43:19.948 --> 04:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
in the state which I think since the
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
renewable energy stuff is local and
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
sustainable it contributes to our energy
 
04:43:27.310 --> 04:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
Independence so I think that's probably
 
04:43:28.270 --> 04:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
why there's a lot of people here to
 
04:43:29.910 --> 04:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
speak on the
 
04:43:32.990 --> 04:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
RPS well I first of all I have to say
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
again your premise is that the people of
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire aren't smart enough to
 
04:43:38.110 --> 04:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
make those decisions for themselves
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
after years and years of being told
 
04:43:42.030 --> 04:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
about climate change and global warming
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again they can
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
they your what your position is they
 
04:43:47.550 --> 04:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
kind of assess that and say this is a
 
04:43:50.190 --> 04:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
good idea I want to buy renewable energy
 
04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to request that the
 
04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
utility sell it to me because they will
 
04:43:55.150 --> 04:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do that and maybe
 
04:43:57.390 --> 04:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
it'll create more renewable energy jobs
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
maybe more people will say you know to
 
04:44:01.590 --> 04:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
hell this 10% or whatever it is I want
 
04:44:04.750 --> 04:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
100% renewable energy and they'll go out
 
04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
and it may create more jobs but you you
 
04:44:10.350 --> 04:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
can't it's the premise that somehow only
 
04:44:12.510 --> 04:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
government can make a decision like that
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
when the facts are well known to
 
04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
everybody and the me the method is there
 
04:44:19.788 --> 04:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
all someone has to do is request
 
04:44:22.670 --> 04:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
eversource what Unitil I want 50%
 
04:44:24.350 --> 04:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and they will have to
 
04:44:26.110 --> 04:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
go get it and if there's a cost
 
04:44:28.030 --> 04:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
associated with it then you'll pay the
 
04:44:29.670 --> 04:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
cost when you request that but if
 
04:44:31.868 --> 04:44:31.878 align:start position:0%
there's enough people requesting it then
 
04:44:33.628 --> 04:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
maybe there'll be more renewable energy
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
and the cost will go down but either way
 
04:44:37.550 --> 04:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
I think the individual consumer is smart
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
enough to make that decision for
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
themselves and we don't have to have the
 
04:44:42.430 --> 04:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
government say basically you know you're
 
04:44:43.830 --> 04:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
too dumb to figure out what type of
 
04:44:45.390 --> 04:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
electricity to buy we're going to tell
 
04:44:48.030 --> 04:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:50.910 --> 04:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
buy so I have a question for you the
 
04:44:53.350 --> 04:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
underlying Assumption of the RPS is that
 
04:44:57.310 --> 04:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy is somehow a good thing
 
04:44:59.948 --> 04:44:59.958 align:start position:0%
a desirable thing
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
and if that is underlying assumption is
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
valid would it not be true that people
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
would be rushing out to buy as much re
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
renewable energy as they could
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
I think they would I think that right
 
04:45:16.430 --> 04:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
now under the present system we have
 
04:45:19.110 --> 04:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
certain limits on there and if we we to
 
04:45:21.390 --> 04:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
renewable energy providers spent less
 
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
time lobbying at the state house and
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
more time advertising and selling their
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
product like other people have to do
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
maybe they'd have a lot more people
 
04:45:30.910 --> 04:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
signing up hey get our energy it's clean
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
there's no pollution come to us we we're
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to save the world whatever but
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
they could to their effort on that and
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure if they can do a good job
 
04:45:39.788 --> 04:45:39.798 align:start position:0%
convincing people that there really is a
 
04:45:41.550 --> 04:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
good reason to buy Renewables energy the
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
people will buy
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
it so currently the community power
 
04:45:49.070 --> 04:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire does offer a
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
plan where people can buy 100% renewable
 
04:45:55.470 --> 04:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
energy and according to the coalition's
 
04:45:59.788 --> 04:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
own statistics only 4% of the customers
 
04:46:02.550 --> 04:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
of the Coalition take advantage of that
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
option do you think that means that
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
people are not as excited about
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy as we've been led to
 
04:46:11.750 --> 04:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
believe well it's other one or two
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
conclusions I guess you can meet either
 
04:46:16.030 --> 04:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
most people aren't aware of that option
 
04:46:18.150 --> 04:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
because the community power is not doing
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
a very good job getting the word out or
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
the people that are aware of it say I
 
04:46:24.270 --> 04:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay extra money if there's
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
extra money involved uh in order to get
 
04:46:28.350 --> 04:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
my electric bill my electric bill is
 
04:46:30.190 --> 04:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
high enough as it is and if I can make
 
04:46:32.110 --> 04:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
it lower even by a small amount that's
 
04:46:34.230 --> 04:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
the choice I'll take but it's my choice
 
04:46:34.240 --> 04:46:36.270 align:start position:0%
the choice I'll take but it's my choice
not

04:46:36.270 --> 04:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:46:38.830 --> 04:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
theirs representative Swanson has a
 
04:46:38.840 --> 04:46:41.070 align:start position:0%
theirs representative Swanson has a
question

04:46:41.070 --> 04:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you uh representative
 
04:46:43.440 --> 04:46:46.150 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you uh representative
Harrington

04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
Harrington
 
04:46:49.350 --> 04:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
um it it seems
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh that by your logic that uh all only
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
people who uh have children in school
 
04:47:01.350 --> 04:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
should be paying for schools and uh that
 
04:47:03.788 --> 04:47:03.798 align:start position:0%
we don't have a collective interest and
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
that as a collective state that we can
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
encourage things or Investments at a
 
04:47:11.670 --> 04:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
level that would benefit others
 
04:47:14.110 --> 04:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
and uh it is worth making that
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
investment because instead of being able
 
04:47:19.868 --> 04:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
to buy an extra dozen eggs per year or
 
04:47:21.830 --> 04:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
something like that some of that money
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
is going to go back to be invested into
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps a renewable energy source and so
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
are you saying that uh they that would
 
04:47:33.150 --> 04:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely be a valid alternative that
 
04:47:35.350 --> 04:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
we should just leave it up to individual
 
04:47:38.110 --> 04:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
citizens to decide how we're going to
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
get our energy and whether it's going to
 
04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
be renewable
 
04:47:44.670 --> 04:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
definitely I mean again you taking the
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
position it sounds like that people
 
04:47:47.350 --> 04:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
aren't smart enough to make that
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
decision for themselves so the
 
04:47:51.070 --> 04:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
government must step in and say no no no
 
04:47:52.990 --> 04:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
no you're not intelligent enough to make
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
a decision on what type of energy to buy
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
so we're going to force you to buy this
 
04:47:58.110 --> 04:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
because we know what's right for you and
 
04:47:59.708 --> 04:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
you don't know what's right for yourself
 
04:48:02.070 --> 04:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity for freedom and
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
in a case like this where it this it
 
04:48:06.670 --> 04:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
would simply work because you could
 
04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
everyone would have the option of saying
 
04:48:10.948 --> 04:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
to the utility I want 100% uh renewable
 
04:48:13.990 --> 04:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
I want 50% renewable I want 0% renewable
 
04:48:15.868 --> 04:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
it's there the vehicle would be there
 
04:48:17.350 --> 04:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's not like something has to be done
 
04:48:19.470 --> 04:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
to establish that which is saying that
 
04:48:21.990 --> 04:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
individuals in a free Society should be
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
able to decide what type of energy they
 
04:48:26.548 --> 04:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
want to buy follow-up question Mr chair
 
04:48:30.030 --> 04:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
yes followup so um I
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
um I take exception to the uh assertion
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
that individuals are smart enough it
 
04:48:39.030 --> 04:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
isn't about being smart it's having an
 
04:48:41.548 --> 04:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or system that's there
 
04:48:43.708 --> 04:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
that enables or facilitate what you're
 
04:48:45.948 --> 04:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
saying should be done you know if I
 
04:48:47.868 --> 04:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
wanted more renewable energy I couldn't
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
do too much except for Community power
 
04:48:51.990 --> 04:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
when I was deciding whether I was going
 
04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
to install solar panels and even though
 
04:48:56.110 --> 04:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
I'm never going to pay it off I probably
 
04:48:57.548 --> 04:48:57.558 align:start position:0%
won't get a complete return on
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
investment in my lifetime I know that a
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
it is for every time that I produce
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
energy that goes out to The Grid I don't
 
04:49:07.750 --> 04:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
know who uses it because I do have a
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
surplus I don't know who uses it but uh
 
04:49:12.910 --> 04:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
I think that it's an ultimately a
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
benefit overall for that and I might not
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
have done it if it weren't for the
 
04:49:19.150 --> 04:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
credits that I could have earned by
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
getting that and not everybody can do
 
04:49:22.750 --> 04:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the thing it isn't an
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
individual individual Choice it's a
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
individual situation but if we work
 
04:49:30.350 --> 04:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
together then we can have better ability
 
04:49:33.510 --> 04:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
to provide guidance to get that and so
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't really ask a question
 
04:49:37.470 --> 04:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
but I do take exception that it isn't
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
about smarts remember we're not debating
 
04:49:41.750 --> 04:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're asking questions
 
04:49:44.350 --> 04:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
right okay any can I respond to that Mr
 
04:49:46.548 --> 04:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
chairman absolutely yep uh I think
 
04:49:49.270 --> 04:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
you're confused on the issue because
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
there is a methodology for an individual
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
to make a decision for themselves on
 
04:49:55.310 --> 04:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
this if you want 100% Renewable Power
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
under this bill you could get it your
 
04:49:58.910 --> 04:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
neighbor could get it the person down
 
04:50:00.670 --> 04:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
the street could get it you wanted to
 
04:50:02.948 --> 04:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
put in solar panels it has no effect on
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
ability to put solar panels in um if
 
04:50:07.868 --> 04:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
things aren't subsidized and they and
 
04:50:09.788 --> 04:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
they don't get done maybe there's a good
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
reason they're not done because if
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
people aren't willing to spend their own
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
money on an idea it's probably not such
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
a good idea and this would give you the
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
vehicle so make sure this is very clear
 
04:50:20.430 --> 04:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
to everybody this would provide a
 
04:50:23.070 --> 04:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle so anybody and everybody could
 
04:50:28.830 --> 04:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
sources okay representative PL has a
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you chair uh thank you
 
04:50:37.548 --> 04:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington did in this
 
04:50:39.628 --> 04:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
bill the phase
 
04:50:42.750 --> 04:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
out but the government had its thumb on
 
04:50:46.750 --> 04:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
the scale by providing this with Rex the
 
04:50:50.110 --> 04:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
people who and municipalities who put in
 
04:50:50.120 --> 04:50:51.350 align:start position:0%
people who and municipalities who put in
their

04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
Capital I've heard from my district
 
04:50:57.190 --> 04:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's not enough time for them to get
 
04:50:59.548 --> 04:50:59.558 align:start position:0%
it back did you consider grandfathering
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
in and if so it's a two-part question if
 
04:51:06.030 --> 04:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
so if not do your reason why thank you
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
no I didn't but it it's obviously we
 
04:51:09.390 --> 04:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
could we could consider something like
 
04:51:11.230 --> 04:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
that but I think we have to be clear
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
though on message here if you make a
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
commitment based on a government handout
 
04:51:17.590 --> 04:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that you're going
 
04:51:19.990 --> 04:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
to get that handout forever and you have
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
to take that into uh that should be one
 
04:51:24.070 --> 04:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
of the variables in your assessment well
 
04:51:26.390 --> 04:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
what if they stop this project in three
 
04:51:28.548 --> 04:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
years two years 10 years and then you
 
04:51:30.510 --> 04:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
make a decision on your own I still
 
04:51:32.350 --> 04:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
think it's worth going forward or I
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going forward but
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee it's like you know
 
04:51:38.110 --> 04:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
last year I paid less than taxes if they
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't renew the tax cuts I'm going to
 
04:51:41.628 --> 04:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
pay more this year I can't go spend the
 
04:51:43.430 --> 04:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
money hoping that they'll renew the tax
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
cuts cuz they might not that's the risk
 
04:51:47.230 --> 04:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
one takes when it's when dealing with
 
04:51:48.990 --> 04:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
government programs they're all subject
 
04:51:52.350 --> 04:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:55.390 --> 04:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
stopped representative Wendy Thomas
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um you you have said
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
over and over that that what did you
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
call this the uh rate payers are not
 
04:52:06.510 --> 04:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
stupid act and you keep saying people
 
04:52:10.270 --> 04:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
are too stupid um energy as we know is a
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
very complicated topic which is why when
 
04:52:15.750 --> 04:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
we present the St bills on the floor
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
everybody falls asleep I mean they just
 
04:52:20.270 --> 04:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
they and I'm not saying they're stupid
 
04:52:23.470 --> 04:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
but it's very very complicated isn't
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
their quality value in the government
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
giving us guidance and
 
04:52:31.990 --> 04:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
incentive well the government's been
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
giving us guidance and incentives now
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
for I don't know how long this build
 
04:52:37.350 --> 04:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
been around 10 15 years and like I say
 
04:52:39.788 --> 04:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
there's constant amount of information
 
04:52:42.150 --> 04:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
being released on the evils of fossil
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
fuel and the wonders of renewable energy
 
04:52:47.070 --> 04:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
it's this isn't like uh rocket science
 
04:52:47.948 --> 04:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
stuff anymore it's pretty
 
04:52:50.190 --> 04:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward everyone's seeing the
 
04:52:53.350 --> 04:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
stuff carbon dioxide gets produced by by
 
04:52:56.350 --> 04:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh fossil fuels uh renewable energy such
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
as solar and wind don't produce carbon
 
04:53:00.510 --> 04:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
dioxide and I just think that adequate
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
information is out there so people can
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
make a decision for themselves and this
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
would apply allow for a vehicle so that
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
anybody who said no I want to do part of
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
my share I I don't want to go with
 
04:53:12.788 --> 04:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
whatever it is now 20% I want to go up
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
to 50% renewable because I think it's
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
that important or it can go to 100% or
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
it can go to zero but I think the
 
04:53:20.430 --> 04:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
individual certainly has the information
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
and this gives them the wherewith all to
 
04:53:21.878 --> 04:53:24.270 align:start position:0%
and this gives them the wherewith all to
do

04:53:24.270 --> 04:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
it okay representative McGee has a
 
04:53:29.310 --> 04:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
04:53:33.390 --> 04:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
question so we we he we've heard in
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier uh that you can't know
 
04:53:37.470 --> 04:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
where you're going until you know where
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
you are right the RPS program
 
04:53:43.350 --> 04:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the RPS program was
 
04:53:47.470 --> 04:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
designed to help us sort of measure whe
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
where we were at in terms of goals that
 
04:53:51.910 --> 04:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
we were setting as a state at the time
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and that was uh looking at the
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
different aspects of our energy
 
04:53:58.270 --> 04:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
portfolio and trying to clean them up
 
04:53:59.948 --> 04:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure we were lowering
 
04:54:02.110 --> 04:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
emissions so we actually had a plan at
 
04:54:04.548 --> 04:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
the time which we don't have now that we
 
04:54:08.110 --> 04:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
were rocking to and it was the original
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
um statute was 20 5% by 2025 right so we
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
were going to be looking at the RPS this
 
04:54:20.270 --> 04:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
year in terms of have we met that goal
 
04:54:21.910 --> 04:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
um but we're not talking about goals
 
04:54:23.948 --> 04:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
anymore now we're just talking about
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
poking holes in what we have and what we
 
04:54:27.868 --> 04:54:27.878 align:start position:0%
like and what we don't so what I'm
 
04:54:30.628 --> 04:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
curious about is what you think it does
 
04:54:32.590 --> 04:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
to the people you say governments can
 
04:54:34.430 --> 04:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
pull away programs whenever they want
 
04:54:37.230 --> 04:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
and nobody should depend on them but the
 
04:54:38.750 --> 04:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
fact is this was something that was
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
strategically put in place in order to
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
give people a way to be able to look at
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
the measurements of how the state was
 
04:54:47.548 --> 04:54:47.558 align:start position:0%
doing and also figure out if they wanted
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
to contribute in some way so how does
 
04:54:53.948 --> 04:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
this how does taking this away at this
 
04:54:57.430 --> 04:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
point help anything in the energy sector
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
you you you're talking about freedom but
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
what about the consistency for people to
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
understand that they can undertake an
 
04:55:07.230 --> 04:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
investment that they might want to
 
04:55:10.590 --> 04:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
undertake and know that their turnaround
 
04:55:12.270 --> 04:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
on that investment is going to be
 
04:55:14.070 --> 04:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
something that's a constant because I
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
think others tried to sort of allude to
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
that point we heard testimony in this
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
committee this year about there's a long
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
Tale on the return on investment for um
 
04:55:25.708 --> 04:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
investing in solar and and other type of
 
04:55:27.230 --> 04:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
things so it's important that there is
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
some kind of an incentive where people
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
simply aren't going to do it well I'm
 
04:55:33.350 --> 04:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
not sure if I got a question there but I
 
04:55:35.788 --> 04:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
I think I've heard a little bit of one I
 
04:55:37.628 --> 04:55:37.638 align:start position:0%
I would respond I guess on that by if
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
you want to use that logic then uh we
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
built a coal plant in 1940 with certain
 
04:55:46.110 --> 04:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
pollution laws in effect I complied with
 
04:55:50.070 --> 04:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
those laws in 1940 now it's 1980 or
 
04:55:52.510 --> 04:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
1990 putting in a Mercury scrubber
 
04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
putting in something else putting in a
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
cooling tower all those rules weren't
 
04:55:58.390 --> 04:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
there before now you're imposing these
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
new great costs on me why shouldn't I
 
04:56:02.548 --> 04:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
have consistency and let that coal plant
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
just sit there for the next 100 years
 
04:56:06.990 --> 04:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
producing all the stuff that it produces
 
04:56:08.948 --> 04:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
without pollution controls there's a
 
04:56:11.470 --> 04:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
constant changing and r in of things
 
04:56:13.628 --> 04:56:13.638 align:start position:0%
we're also told during this that it was
 
04:56:16.310 --> 04:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
a startup push on the renewable energy
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
that they needed it I specifically
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
remember hearing uh the person from next
 
04:56:22.230 --> 04:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
era who was one of the largest producers
 
04:56:24.430 --> 04:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy in the country then
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
and now and they were saying we're going
 
04:56:28.430 --> 04:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
to need this to get going but the hope
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
is that we get to the economies of scale
 
04:56:32.190 --> 04:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
and especially things like with wind
 
04:56:34.270 --> 04:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
we'll start making it cheaper and we've
 
04:56:36.510 --> 04:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
heard that promise over and over again
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
that wind and solar are going to be
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
cheaper than gas and if that's the case
 
04:56:42.590 --> 04:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
then why do we have to force people to
 
04:56:45.708 --> 04:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
buy the wind and
 
04:56:49.150 --> 04:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
solar yes go ahead and wind and solar
 
04:56:51.750 --> 04:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
are cheaper than gas now aren't
 
04:56:55.230 --> 04:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
they on the average note maybe on a
 
04:56:57.190 --> 04:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
particular day they might be but I think
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
if you look across the board they're uh
 
04:57:03.910 --> 04:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:06.510 --> 04:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
cheaper okay seeing no more questions
 
04:57:08.190 --> 04:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation I'd like to call next
 
04:57:14.788 --> 04:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
representative Lori coren of Berlin coas
 
04:57:18.110 --> 04:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
County district
 
04:57:24.670 --> 04:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
much my name is Lori coren and I
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
represent the people of Coos County
 
04:57:36.670 --> 04:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
district 7 I come before you today to
 
04:57:38.548 --> 04:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and ask that you vote
 
04:57:42.270 --> 04:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on HB 219 the
 
04:57:45.548 --> 04:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
RPS law has worked as intended fostering
 
04:57:47.470 --> 04:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's homegrown power
 
04:57:47.480 --> 04:57:49.150 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's homegrown power
generation

04:57:49.150 --> 04:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
generation
 
04:57:52.070 --> 04:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
creating high paying jobs and increased
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
tax revenue this bill does absolutely
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
nothing to improve the state's economy
 
04:57:59.350 --> 04:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
and it will hurt existing jobs and lower
 
04:58:02.030 --> 04:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
tax revenues with zero guarantees of
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
lower power rates I come from Berlin so
 
04:58:06.990 --> 04:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
I represent the people of
 
04:58:09.548 --> 04:58:09.558 align:start position:0%
Berlin as most of you probably know we
 
04:58:12.350 --> 04:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
have Berlin biomass there in Berlin
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
which is just finding its way out of um
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy it's it's trying to get back
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
on its
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
feet uh agreeing to this bill now would
 
04:58:29.628 --> 04:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely destroy Berlin um not only do
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
they do they give most of our residents
 
04:58:35.948 --> 04:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
jobs um but they also contribute to the
 
04:58:38.548 --> 04:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh tax revenue that our citizens in
 
04:58:40.948 --> 04:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
Berlin really rely on
 
04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
um the Coos County um has a windmill
 
04:58:49.510 --> 04:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
project in dickville and in Cambridge
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
that windmill project alone gives us
 
04:58:54.788 --> 04:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars that
 
04:58:57.310 --> 04:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
help our delegation to pay for our
 
04:58:57.320 --> 04:58:58.548 align:start position:0%
help our delegation to pay for our
nursing

04:58:58.548 --> 04:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
04:59:02.110 --> 04:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
homes um supporting this bill now could
 
04:59:05.230 --> 04:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
destroy all of that I humbly ask you to
 
04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
vote itl on this
 
04:59:11.070 --> 04:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you thank you questions
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%

Association which is the trade
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
Association for small hydros in New
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I want to really focus on
 
05:00:19.390 --> 05:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that the renewable portfolio
 
05:00:21.708 --> 05:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
standard in New Hampshire was created in
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
an effort to create a minimum level of
 
05:00:27.110 --> 05:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
fuel diversity in a uh to protect rate
 
05:00:29.948 --> 05:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
payers from Price volatility it was just
 
05:00:32.030 --> 05:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
two years ago that we were paying 26
 
05:00:35.310 --> 05:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
Cents default Service rates and that
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
amount of price volatility is not good
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
for rate payers supporting our local
 
05:00:42.868 --> 05:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
Renewables resources helps reduce some
 
05:00:45.270 --> 05:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the risk of that price volatility
 
05:00:47.150 --> 05:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
those really high default Service rates
 
05:00:51.868 --> 05:00:51.878 align:start position:0%
were caused by global uh anxiety over
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
05:00:55.628 --> 05:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
prices um the renewable portfolio
 
05:00:58.990 --> 05:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
standard includes class 4 existing Hydro
 
05:01:00.990 --> 05:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
resources um and some of our small
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
hydros also uh are able to qualify for
 
05:01:05.548 --> 05:01:05.558 align:start position:0%
class one new resources Rex when they
 
05:01:07.590 --> 05:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
put additional uh new
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
generation Our RPS goals in New
 
05:01:13.590 --> 05:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are modest our alternative
 
05:01:16.590 --> 05:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
compliance payment levels which act as a
 
05:01:18.910 --> 05:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
price ceiling for renewable energy
 
05:01:21.030 --> 05:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
certificates are
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
$34.99 a megawatt hour for class 4 uh
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's conservative when you look at
 
05:01:29.830 --> 05:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
wreck markets in the region the cost to
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
rate payers is small especially compared
 
05:01:35.510 --> 05:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the benefits the C the average cost
 
05:01:38.430 --> 05:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
rate payers in 2023 which was the last
 
05:01:41.070 --> 05:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
report was a third of a cent per
 
05:01:45.070 --> 05:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour that's maybe about 24
 
05:01:47.470 --> 05:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
bucks a year for the average residential
 
05:01:50.070 --> 05:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
customer dams with Hydro are
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
wellmaintained they are carefully
 
05:01:55.628 --> 05:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
overseen and operated the RPS and Rex
 
05:01:58.150 --> 05:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
are very important especially to the
 
05:02:00.510 --> 05:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
smaller Hydro projects if we get rid of
 
05:02:02.670 --> 05:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
the RPS and put some of those smaller
 
05:02:04.948 --> 05:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
projects out of business we lose
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
important generation and we lose that
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
responsible Dam operator which can make
 
05:02:11.990 --> 05:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
that Dam become a public
 
05:02:14.190 --> 05:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
liability for all those reasons I would
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
ask you to itl hb2 219 and to support
 
05:02:20.110 --> 05:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
both our renewable portfolio standard
 
05:02:23.470 --> 05:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
and our local small Hydro power
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
resources thank you thank you Miss Mano
 
05:02:28.350 --> 05:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today good to see
 
05:02:30.390 --> 05:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
you again questions for Miss Mano
 
05:02:32.788 --> 05:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you for being here
 
05:02:39.150 --> 05:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
you um you briefly touched on this but
 
05:02:40.548 --> 05:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could go into a
 
05:02:42.548 --> 05:02:42.558 align:start position:0%
little more detail into the financial
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
impact including jobs and possible
 
05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
closures if the RPS was phased out for
 
05:02:51.628 --> 05:02:51.638 align:start position:0%
your industri sure so Grant State hydrop
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
Power Association is really focused on
 
05:02:55.948 --> 05:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
the small projects which is under five
 
05:02:58.390 --> 05:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
megawatts um I happened to be visiting a
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
colleague's project recently which is uh
 
05:03:04.830 --> 05:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
400 kilowatts so that's pretty small and
 
05:03:06.390 --> 05:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
I flat out asked him because I knew this
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
bill was coming up and I said if you
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have New Hampshire class 4 would
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
would you be able to keep running this
 
05:03:13.948 --> 05:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
project and he said nope I couldn't keep
 
05:03:18.070 --> 05:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
it going financially so that's you know
 
05:03:19.948 --> 05:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
the truth I think especially for the one
 
05:03:22.110 --> 05:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
megawatt and under projects the
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
economics are very challenging without
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
Rex and a lot of times these are smaller
 
05:03:29.868 --> 05:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
owner operators they're not you know
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of their time trying to
 
05:03:34.110 --> 05:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
qu cross qualify in different markets or
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
things like that New Hampshire class 4
 
05:03:37.750 --> 05:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
Rex may be the only type of Rex that
 
05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
their projects qualify for so um and
 
05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
then you know as far as Jobs typically
 
05:03:46.110 --> 05:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
for us each project has at least one
 
05:03:46.120 --> 05:03:47.230 align:start position:0%
for us each project has at least one
full-time

05:03:47.230 --> 05:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
operator and we hire lots of local
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
contractors and businesses you know we
 
05:03:54.110 --> 05:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
certainly go shopping for lots of
 
05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
supplies at the local hardware store as
 
05:03:59.708 --> 05:03:59.718 align:start position:0%
well as lumber yard steel we buy lots of
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
supplies this is large infrastructure
 
05:04:03.990 --> 05:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
that Demands a lot of Maintenance and
 
05:04:05.830 --> 05:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
upkeep thank
 
05:04:08.670 --> 05:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
 
05:04:08.680 --> 05:04:10.670 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
Swanson

05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
Swanson
 
05:04:13.430 --> 05:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for uh
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
being with us today uh question uh so
 
05:04:19.990 --> 05:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
relative to uh representative
 
05:04:22.750 --> 05:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
Harrington's earlier statements uh do
 
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
you me uh can you envision a scenario
 
05:04:26.948 --> 05:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
where the rate payers individually are
 
05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
smart enough to uh get the generation
 
05:04:34.150 --> 05:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
locally that's renewable that you
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
provide uh as an alternative if they had
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
the money back it's not a question of
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
smart enough in my mind it's not having
 
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
access to the market right like they an
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
individual residential Electric customer
 
05:04:50.070 --> 05:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
is has no idea
 
05:04:52.110 --> 05:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
honestly how where their electricity
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
comes from or why their electricity was
 
05:04:56.708 --> 05:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
so expensive two years ago the average
 
05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
Electric customer spend something like
 
05:05:02.190 --> 05:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
two minutes a billing cycle looking or
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
thinking about their electric bill
 
05:05:07.788 --> 05:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
so an an individual residential customer
 
05:05:09.948 --> 05:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
can't go to their local Hydro power
 
05:05:12.030 --> 05:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
station and say I want to buy your power
 
05:05:15.390 --> 05:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
and make that happen so it's more about
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
having access to the markets and with 20
 
05:05:23.350 --> 05:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
$24 a year they're not going to change
 
05:05:26.548 --> 05:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
market dynamics either okay thank you
 
05:05:28.670 --> 05:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
Mr so I have a question for you because
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
I know you know this stuff well you've
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
been around around it for quite a while
 
05:05:37.200 --> 05:05:38.590 align:start position:0%
been around around it for quite a while

05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
yep the purpose statement of that law
 
05:05:46.000 --> 05:05:47.708 align:start position:0%
yep the purpose statement of that law
states

05:05:47.708 --> 05:05:47.718 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
that the most compelling reason to
 
05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
restructure the New Hampshire electric
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
utility industry is to reduce costs for
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
all customers of electricity by
 
05:06:01.350 --> 05:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
harnessing the power of competitive
 
05:06:03.990 --> 05:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
markets doesn't the
 
05:06:07.350 --> 05:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
RSA fly in the face of the stated
 
05:06:10.590 --> 05:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of RSA 374f so I would argue
 
05:06:13.750 --> 05:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
that the RPS is a competitive market re
 
05:06:17.670 --> 05:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
are a commodity and when we generate re
 
05:06:20.030 --> 05:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're competing directly against the
 
05:06:23.910 --> 05:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
other generators that also generate reck
 
05:06:26.910 --> 05:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
and so all of the entities that have to
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
purchase Rex so yes that's a mandate but
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
they're looking for the best deal for
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
their customers or rate payers and so
 
05:06:38.830 --> 05:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
I'm competing in pricing against other
 
05:06:38.840 --> 05:06:40.750 align:start position:0%
I'm competing in pricing against other
wreck

05:06:40.750 --> 05:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
wreck
 
05:06:44.670 --> 05:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
generators um the only way that a
 
05:06:47.470 --> 05:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
supplier should be paying top dollar
 
05:06:49.230 --> 05:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
which is capped by the alternative
 
05:06:51.470 --> 05:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
compliance payment is if there's not
 
05:06:51.480 --> 05:06:52.628 align:start position:0%
compliance payment is if there's not
enough

05:06:52.628 --> 05:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
enough
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
Supply and then there's a feedback
 
05:06:56.830 --> 05:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism with a renewable energy fund
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
that aims to increase that Supply so
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
unless there's an imbalance in the
 
05:07:03.590 --> 05:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
market really all of the generators
 
05:07:05.190 --> 05:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
should be competing against each other
 
05:07:06.628 --> 05:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
in a competitive
 
05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
market to give rid payers the best deal
 
05:07:11.470 --> 05:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
on those
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
wrecks but isn't R7 RSA 378 F about
 
05:07:20.830 --> 05:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
electricity markets not about renewable
 
05:07:24.430 --> 05:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
energy credit or certificate markets
 
05:07:26.270 --> 05:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
they're two different markets they are
 
05:07:29.510 --> 05:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes and aren't they
 
05:07:32.190 --> 05:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
incompatible I don't think they're
 
05:07:34.150 --> 05:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
incompatible as I said I think our
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard is very
 
05:07:39.270 --> 05:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
modest it's not telling the rate payer
 
05:07:41.230 --> 05:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
what 100% of their electricity should
 
05:07:44.788 --> 05:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
come from we're talking about 25% at
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
most and so I still think that it's a
 
05:07:48.160 --> 05:07:50.110 align:start position:0%
most and so I still think that it's a
very

05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:07:52.830 --> 05:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
conservative minimum amount of fuel
 
05:07:55.510 --> 05:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
diversity and local resources that we
 
05:07:57.548 --> 05:07:57.558 align:start position:0%
want to make sure to keep around the
 
05:07:57.558 --> 05:07:58.628 align:start position:0%
want to make sure to keep around the
other

05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
75% of electricity that is supplied in
 
05:08:03.390 --> 05:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can come from any
 
05:08:06.788 --> 05:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
resource and that still might be you
 
05:08:09.548 --> 05:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
know sort of a lack of fuel diversity
 
05:08:12.868 --> 05:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to dictate every
 
05:08:14.670 --> 05:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
electron of electricity where it's
 
05:08:17.310 --> 05:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
coming from I don't think that having
 
05:08:17.320 --> 05:08:18.270 align:start position:0%
coming from I don't think that having
that

05:08:18.270 --> 05:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:21.310 --> 05:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
25% let's make sure we keep not all of
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
our eggs in one basket is completely
 
05:08:23.600 --> 05:08:25.110 align:start position:0%
our eggs in one basket is completely
incompatible

05:08:25.110 --> 05:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
incompatible
 
05:08:30.150 --> 05:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
with giving great payers some price
 
05:08:31.788 --> 05:08:31.798 align:start position:0%
competitiveness okay thank you
 
05:08:34.310 --> 05:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
05:08:36.548 --> 05:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and you you intuited
 
05:08:37.990 --> 05:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
that I had it I don't even think I got
 
05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
my hand up um so you've mentioned a few
 
05:08:43.150 --> 05:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
things that I tried probably very poorly
 
05:08:45.948 --> 05:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
to mention in my prior questions which
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
is that it's a market and that we should
 
05:08:51.190 --> 05:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
first Do no harm certainly um but what
 
05:08:53.708 --> 05:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
interests me is um hydros I think
 
05:08:55.948 --> 05:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
provide a very kind of
 
05:09:00.990 --> 05:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
unique um uh unique quality to our uh
 
05:09:03.628 --> 05:09:03.638 align:start position:0%
local sustainable energy in that they're
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
dispatchable right so we're talking a
 
05:09:08.030 --> 05:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
lot about both both affordability and
 
05:09:10.788 --> 05:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
reliability and certainly we can rely on
 
05:09:12.868 --> 05:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
our hydros and we don't want to see even
 
05:09:14.948 --> 05:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
the small ones go under for the value
 
05:09:16.628 --> 05:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
that they bring right that that would be
 
05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
me saying that but I think in general
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
the committee has agreed to that so the
 
05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
question is you you talked
 
05:09:29.990 --> 05:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
about um the current a AC uh P Price and
 
05:09:32.070 --> 05:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
it being relatively conservative is that
 
05:09:36.590 --> 05:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
in contrast to other states around and
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
how does our wreck Market uh integrate
 
05:09:41.548 --> 05:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
with theirs in other words I'm trying to
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
figure out what the disadvantage would
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
be if it if it just simply went away so
 
05:09:47.708 --> 05:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
um yes I was saying it's relatively
 
05:09:50.350 --> 05:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
conservative compared to other wreck
 
05:09:53.430 --> 05:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
markets for similar resources um you
 
05:09:56.510 --> 05:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
know when Massachusetts for example had
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
the SRE program those were two I think
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
$200 or more a megawatt hour um so that
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
I would consider extremely generous as a
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
a a a wreck value and their goal goal
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
was to create a boom in development so
 
05:10:14.590 --> 05:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
they were generous I think on purpose
 
05:10:17.948 --> 05:10:17.958 align:start position:0%
um most resources you know if they can
 
05:10:21.628 --> 05:10:21.638 align:start position:0%
qualify in other wreck markets they can
 
05:10:23.548 --> 05:10:23.558 align:start position:0%
um sell their decide where to sell their
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
wrecks because it's a competitive market
 
05:10:29.070 --> 05:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
there is not um a requirement that um
 
05:10:32.190 --> 05:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
but every Market has requirements to
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
qualify so for example for small hydros
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
to qualify in the Massachusetts Market
 
05:10:38.830 --> 05:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
you have to be low impact Hydro
 
05:10:38.840 --> 05:10:40.190 align:start position:0%
you have to be low impact Hydro
certified

05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
certified
 
05:10:43.868 --> 05:10:43.878 align:start position:0%
that comes at a cost not every project
 
05:10:46.948 --> 05:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
is certifiable as low impact Hydro um in
 
05:10:48.830 --> 05:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they have to be in New
 
05:10:50.510 --> 05:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or interconnected in New
 
05:10:52.830 --> 05:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we actually have somewhat
 
05:10:56.310 --> 05:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
of a protection from having other hydros
 
05:11:00.548 --> 05:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
swamping our wreck Market um so in every
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
state for every class there are
 
05:11:06.350 --> 05:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
requirements to qualify to be able to
 
05:11:10.990 --> 05:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.270 --> 05:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
follow up and the followup would be on
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
another portion of your testimony where
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
you initially talked about um costs and
 
05:11:20.670 --> 05:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
benefits and you talked about how
 
05:11:22.390 --> 05:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire dams are
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
well-maintained because we have a hydro
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
Market um
 
05:11:29.830 --> 05:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
so it sounded to me like what you were
 
05:11:32.070 --> 05:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
saying is that you're doing that damn
 
05:11:34.310 --> 05:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance but we don't have a plan for
 
05:11:36.390 --> 05:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
how that would happen if we put if we
 
05:11:38.910 --> 05:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
put small Hydro out of business yeah
 
05:11:41.030 --> 05:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
what I I was trying to say is if a small
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hydro project goes out of business
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
because it's no longer financially
 
05:11:47.910 --> 05:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
viable in part because they lost direct
 
05:11:51.628 --> 05:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
revenues um then that owner no longer
 
05:11:54.190 --> 05:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
has a source of Revenue to maintain that
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
Dam and so it may become a public
 
05:11:58.830 --> 05:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
liability either the costs will go to
 
05:12:01.868 --> 05:12:01.878 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or it will become less safe
 
05:12:06.390 --> 05:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
and become a risk to the public um some
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
dams where Hydro is operating are public
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
dams that are being leased by the Hydro
 
05:12:13.868 --> 05:12:13.878 align:start position:0%
power operator to be able to operate
 
05:12:16.390 --> 05:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
Hydro if they no longer are running that
 
05:12:18.990 --> 05:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hydro power it will go back to the
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
public entity that owns it and therefore
 
05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:28.350 --> 05:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers okay seeing no further
 
05:12:30.670 --> 05:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you and next
 
05:12:30.680 --> 05:12:31.590 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you and next
bring

05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
bring
 
05:12:34.910 --> 05:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
up Brandon Kibby representing Great
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Brandon good afternoon
 
05:12:49.628 --> 05:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my name is Brandon
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
Kibby vice president of external affairs
 
05:12:53.230 --> 05:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
with Great River Hydro thank you Mr
 
05:12:55.390 --> 05:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and the committee for taking uh
 
05:12:58.590 --> 05:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
my comments I'm also circulating uh two
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh handouts written testimony as well as
 
05:13:02.948 --> 05:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
just a sort of general fact sheet about
 
05:13:04.910 --> 05:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
Great River Hydro while that's
 
05:13:06.190 --> 05:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
circulating I'll give you a couple of
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
the highlights on on the facts about
 
05:13:10.230 --> 05:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
Great River Hydro uh and first of all
 
05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
I'm here to uh uh uh to oppose uh uh HB
 
05:13:19.150 --> 05:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
219 um uh as well um Great River Hydro
 
05:13:20.670 --> 05:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
operates 13 different generating
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
stations and three storage only
 
05:13:24.310 --> 05:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
reservoirs on the Connecticut River and
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
Deerfield rivers in New Hampshire
 
05:13:28.948 --> 05:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
Vermont and uh Western Massachusetts six
 
05:13:30.310 --> 05:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
of those stations and two of those
 
05:13:32.548 --> 05:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
storage only reservoirs are on the
 
05:13:35.310 --> 05:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River here in New Hampshire
 
05:13:39.990 --> 05:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
um these are uh about 5503 megawatts of
 
05:13:41.788 --> 05:13:41.798 align:start position:0%
installed capacity in New Hampshire
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
alone uh so we are the largest uh
 
05:13:47.150 --> 05:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
conventional hydropower generator not
 
05:13:48.470 --> 05:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
just in New England but obviously here
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and probably the
 
05:13:51.868 --> 05:13:51.878 align:start position:0%
largest um renewable energy generator in
 
05:13:51.878 --> 05:13:52.590 align:start position:0%
largest um renewable energy generator in
New

05:13:52.590 --> 05:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:13:55.948 --> 05:13:55.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um these are the largest dams
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh Moore and cumerford Dam are the
 
05:14:00.030 --> 05:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
largest dams in all of New England on
 
05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
the largest river um this is massive
 
05:14:04.548 --> 05:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
infrastructure massive infrastructure on
 
05:14:06.990 --> 05:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
a very large river um we're a wholesale
 
05:14:08.708 --> 05:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
electric generator we're not a retail
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
Electric electric generator we don't
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
sell directly to customers we sell um uh
 
05:14:15.510 --> 05:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
into the wholesale electricity Market
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
about 1.6 million megawatt hours a year
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
um it's tremendous amount of generation
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
about enough generation to power 213,000
 
05:14:25.590 --> 05:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
homes on
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
average um and our our hydrop power is
 
05:14:30.750 --> 05:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
pretty unique we have uh Reservoir
 
05:14:32.788 --> 05:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
storage all of our hydrogenating
 
05:14:36.030 --> 05:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
stations all of that uh uh allows for
 
05:14:38.270 --> 05:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
base load power to be produced at all
 
05:14:40.510 --> 05:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
times 24 7 but also allows us to
 
05:14:42.430 --> 05:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
dispatch when the system needs us the
 
05:14:44.990 --> 05:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
most meaning we can come on when prices
 
05:14:47.788 --> 05:14:47.798 align:start position:0%
rise and help keep the prices lower
 
05:14:50.310 --> 05:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
because of that dispatchability um our
 
05:14:52.350 --> 05:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
hydros also provide a tremendous amount
 
05:14:54.910 --> 05:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
of other grid resources uh or grid
 
05:14:56.590 --> 05:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
reliability resources that other
 
05:14:58.948 --> 05:14:58.958 align:start position:0%
renewable variable renewable generators
 
05:15:03.670 --> 05:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
can't do uh so uh things like um voltage
 
05:15:05.868 --> 05:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
support and frequency regulation and a
 
05:15:06.910 --> 05:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of things that will make
 
05:15:08.670 --> 05:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
your mind go numb thinking about it that
 
05:15:10.910 --> 05:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
are important for the Electric System
 
05:15:12.628 --> 05:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
that most average consumers don't think
 
05:15:15.628 --> 05:15:15.638 align:start position:0%
about uh meline had a good example that
 
05:15:17.548 --> 05:15:17.558 align:start position:0%
people think about their electric I like
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
to say people think about their electric
 
05:15:21.270 --> 05:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
bills twice is once a month when they
 
05:15:24.110 --> 05:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
open their bill and uh if their power
 
05:15:26.270 --> 05:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
goes out that's the only time uh
 
05:15:28.110 --> 05:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
residents ever think about
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
power um uh other benefits of course to
 
05:15:34.750 --> 05:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh our facilities go Way Beyond just the
 
05:15:37.670 --> 05:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
hydropower generation that we produce uh
 
05:15:40.350 --> 05:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
we we have a about 30,000 Acres of
 
05:15:42.750 --> 05:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
property associated with our our hydrop
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
power stations all of that's permanently
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
conserved open to the public to use we
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
manage public boat ramps uh picnic areas
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
dozens of these located throughout all
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
free and open to the public to use at no
 
05:15:58.110 --> 05:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
cost uh River Management so during high
 
05:16:00.390 --> 05:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
water uh uh events we're able to store
 
05:16:02.750 --> 05:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
water in our reservoirs during droughts
 
05:16:05.190 --> 05:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're able to let water out and so the
 
05:16:07.510 --> 05:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
river has recreational opportunities in
 
05:16:09.310 --> 05:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
it all year round if the Connecticut
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
River did not have the type of of hydro
 
05:16:13.948 --> 05:16:13.958 align:start position:0%
storage and generation that we have on
 
05:16:15.910 --> 05:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
it there would be periods of time during
 
05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
the summer where all those people that
 
05:16:18.910 --> 05:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
enjoy going out on their motorboats on
 
05:16:21.070 --> 05:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut River would not be able
 
05:16:22.110 --> 05:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:16:24.708 --> 05:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
that uh uh obviously there's other
 
05:16:27.190 --> 05:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
direct benefits um the jobs that we
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
provide 30 we have 30 folks over 30
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
folks that work for us that are New
 
05:16:33.150 --> 05:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents these are highp
 
05:16:35.430 --> 05:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
paying highly skilled jobs that we we
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
provide uh we also pay uh just under $1
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
million a year in local property taxes
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
in 19 different jurisdictions in New
 
05:16:46.190 --> 05:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we also have a water use
 
05:16:48.270 --> 05:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
contract with the state uh New Hampshire
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
Dees for Murphy Dam and Lake Francis for
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
the use of that facility as well and
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
those funds go directly to the
 
05:16:58.510 --> 05:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance and management of Murphy
 
05:17:01.750 --> 05:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
Dam uh Hydro is as mateline mentioned
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
Hydro requires constant investment these
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
are massive infrastructure roads and
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
bridges you know that well require
 
05:17:11.470 --> 05:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
constant investment the average age of
 
05:17:14.070 --> 05:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
our facilities there's 96 years old this
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
is stuff that was built at the dawn of
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
commercial electrification but is still
 
05:17:20.670 --> 05:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
uh really well-maintained and still
 
05:17:22.868 --> 05:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
operating and functioning in ways but
 
05:17:25.310 --> 05:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's not to say that it was built uh to
 
05:17:27.150 --> 05:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
to representative Harrington's uh
 
05:17:29.868 --> 05:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
earlier Point uh that a coal station is
 
05:17:31.350 --> 05:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
built and it's just should should
 
05:17:33.548 --> 05:17:33.558 align:start position:0%
continually operate no environmental
 
05:17:35.390 --> 05:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
regulations have changed we get a new
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
license every 40 years we have new
 
05:17:39.310 --> 05:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have to meet
 
05:17:42.030 --> 05:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh renewable portfolio standards are
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
really important drivers of investment
 
05:17:46.590 --> 05:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
that we make now we get our we get our
 
05:17:48.030 --> 05:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
our like I said we're a wholesale
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
electric generator we generate uh
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
revenues from a variety of different
 
05:17:53.788 --> 05:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
sources in these markets that have all
 
05:17:56.190 --> 05:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
evolved kind of together uh renewable
 
05:17:57.910 --> 05:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards is one of those
 
05:18:00.390 --> 05:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
markets that we've evolved and have been
 
05:18:04.310 --> 05:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
participating in I can tell you that in
 
05:18:08.070 --> 05:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
2017 uh we've had uh we had 122
 
05:18:11.230 --> 05:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
employees that company uh here in 2025
 
05:18:14.628 --> 05:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
we have just over a 100 uh the the
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
deregulation of the markets in the late
 
05:18:19.948 --> 05:18:19.958 align:start position:0%
90s have struck a whole bunch of uh
 
05:18:22.150 --> 05:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
efficiencies into the electricity Market
 
05:18:23.948 --> 05:18:23.958 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a graph in the back of
 
05:18:26.350 --> 05:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
my comments that shows the wholesale
 
05:18:29.310 --> 05:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
electricity prices going down over those
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
number of years of course in New England
 
05:18:33.548 --> 05:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity prices are driven
 
05:18:36.510 --> 05:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
by the price of gas it's gas-driven
 
05:18:38.910 --> 05:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
electricity so we're price takers in
 
05:18:41.030 --> 05:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
that which means our revenues go down on
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
an annual basis annual basis annual
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
basis as a wholesale electric generator
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
so having access to a diverse source of
 
05:18:49.548 --> 05:18:49.558 align:start position:0%
revenues are really important for us to
 
05:18:51.390 --> 05:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can stay viable and we
 
05:18:53.190 --> 05:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
continue to make the significant Capital
 
05:18:55.830 --> 05:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
Investments that are required uh we
 
05:18:58.590 --> 05:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
recently brought online a brand new 4.7
 
05:19:01.708 --> 05:19:01.718 align:start position:0%
megawatt hydrogenating uh uh uh unit at
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
our Mo facility the single largest Hydro
 
05:19:07.390 --> 05:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
station in all of New England that 4.7
 
05:19:10.788 --> 05:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
megawatt uh uh station generates a new
 
05:19:13.948 --> 05:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
incremental uh uh generation of 27,000
 
05:19:17.150 --> 05:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
megawatts a year of new incremental
 
05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
Generation Um that investment part of
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
the investment thesis was based on the
 
05:19:24.910 --> 05:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
ability to qualify that for renewable
 
05:19:28.110 --> 05:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards um that project
 
05:19:31.868 --> 05:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
alone generates 66,000 new New Hampshire
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
class one uh wrecks into the marketplace
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
increasing the supply and therefore
 
05:19:40.868 --> 05:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
decreasing the overall cost cost of Rex
 
05:19:44.548 --> 05:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire supply and demand um so
 
05:19:47.430 --> 05:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
we based almost $20 million investment
 
05:19:50.708 --> 05:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
in that facility uh in part not solely
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
on Rex but certainly in part on the on
 
05:19:55.350 --> 05:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
the Suite of different Revenue sources
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we can get uh for that that
 
05:20:00.470 --> 05:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
facility and uh that $20 million
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
investment in the town of Littleton
 
05:20:05.948 --> 05:20:05.958 align:start position:0%
means a lot to that Community as well um
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
so in submm we've got about 192,000
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
me megawatt hours a year that we qualify
 
05:20:13.750 --> 05:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire class one Rex these
 
05:20:16.990 --> 05:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
are Regional markets that uh that those
 
05:20:19.390 --> 05:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
those also qualify partly in other
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions as well and we're we have
 
05:20:23.788 --> 05:20:23.798 align:start position:0%
to sell those in a competitive way as
 
05:20:26.270 --> 05:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
meline mentioned into those Regional
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
markets it's a it's a it's one of the
 
05:20:30.310 --> 05:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
legs of the stool that we depend on from
 
05:20:32.750 --> 05:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
a revenue uh standpoint for our business
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
to continue to be as successful as this
 
05:20:34.558 --> 05:20:39.030 align:start position:0%
to continue to be as successful as this
has

05:20:39.030 --> 05:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:43.270 --> 05:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:46.270 --> 05:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you um your written
 
05:20:53.310 --> 05:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
you you generate 1.6 million megawatt
 
05:21:00.830 --> 05:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
hours of carbon free generation annually
 
05:21:03.270 --> 05:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
but you just stated a moment ago that
 
05:21:06.230 --> 05:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
you only qualify
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
192,000 recks per year
 
05:21:12.190 --> 05:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
so for New Hampshire class one Rex if
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
your question is why is it there a
 
05:21:17.310 --> 05:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
discrepancy there so all 1.6 million
 
05:21:19.708 --> 05:21:19.718 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours of ours uh qualify for
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
some wreck somewhere in New England um
 
05:21:26.270 --> 05:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
no two wreck program is alike um and the
 
05:21:29.110 --> 05:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
the qualification um uh uh requirements
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire require a certain
 
05:21:32.788 --> 05:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
amount of investment for class ones to
 
05:21:35.788 --> 05:21:35.798 align:start position:0%
be made for new incremental after a
 
05:21:39.310 --> 05:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
certain date and so when only we've only
 
05:21:41.948 --> 05:21:41.958 align:start position:0%
been able to qualify to date only
 
05:21:45.868 --> 05:21:45.878 align:start position:0%
192,000 megawatt hours out of that 1.6
 
05:21:47.548 --> 05:21:47.558 align:start position:0%
million megawatt hours to qualify for
 
05:21:50.030 --> 05:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire class ones at this point
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
because of that investment requirement
 
05:21:52.750 --> 05:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
but the full
 
05:21:55.628 --> 05:21:55.638 align:start position:0%
1.6 million rex that you would be able
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
to to generate qualify somewhere
 
05:22:01.310 --> 05:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere mostly in Vermont or Maine um
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
because those are very uh uh low
 
05:22:05.470 --> 05:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
required the the qualification
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
requirements there are very low bar just
 
05:22:08.788 --> 05:22:08.798 align:start position:0%
basically need to be a re rable
 
05:22:12.270 --> 05:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
generator period um and so uh whereas
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire class 1's for us to
 
05:22:16.470 --> 05:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
qualify as a pre-existing renewable
 
05:22:18.190 --> 05:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
generator we have to make incremental
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
investment to make incremental new hydro
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so that's where you know like for
 
05:22:25.590 --> 05:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
instance at our Vernon station uh in
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale and Vernon Vermont we had
 
05:22:29.350 --> 05:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
replaced uh four of the generators out
 
05:22:31.948 --> 05:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
of the 10 there with new generators that
 
05:22:35.190 --> 05:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
allowed uh Vernon to qualify um at
 
05:22:36.910 --> 05:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
Comerford we did a very similar thing at
 
05:22:39.070 --> 05:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
Moore we built this brand new UN unit so
 
05:22:40.190 --> 05:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
this is how you have to make these
 
05:22:41.910 --> 05:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
Investments to
 
05:22:45.990 --> 05:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
qualify so M lenos probably knows this
 
05:22:49.548 --> 05:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
question better than I do but just for
 
05:22:54.470 --> 05:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
an example let's use $25 a wreck 1.6
 
05:22:57.390 --> 05:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
million Rex would be worth $40 million
 
05:22:59.708 --> 05:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
is that a sum that you actually collect
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be nice
 
05:23:04.868 --> 05:23:04.878 align:start position:0%
um uh so most of those uh low values
 
05:23:06.670 --> 05:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
like like I said a very high percentage
 
05:23:08.830 --> 05:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
of our generation qualifies for these
 
05:23:11.190 --> 05:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
what what are low value wrecks so these
 
05:23:13.628 --> 05:23:13.638 align:start position:0%
are are wrecks that compete with uh
 
05:23:16.030 --> 05:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
other massively supplied you like L
 
05:23:18.750 --> 05:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
nuclear and other um imported
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
large-scale uh uh Hydro so Vermont tier
 
05:23:24.150 --> 05:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
ones are a good example of that right is
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
that there's a very high Supply Plus
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's a very low demand Vermont's a
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
pretty small state and there's not a lot
 
05:23:31.230 --> 05:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
of demand for these things so large
 
05:23:33.390 --> 05:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
Supply because the qualifications are so
 
05:23:35.788 --> 05:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
low that just about everything qualifies
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
and uh uh low demand so the prices
 
05:23:41.110 --> 05:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
really suppressed so it's you know you
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
know two and a quarter maybe per wreck
 
05:23:48.548 --> 05:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
not okay that that that's understandable
 
05:23:50.430 --> 05:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yep additional questions for
 
05:23:53.788 --> 05:23:53.798 align:start position:0%
Mr Kibby representative McGee thank you
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Mr Kibby for
 
05:23:57.670 --> 05:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you bring up a
 
05:23:59.910 --> 05:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
good point you know we started with um
 
05:24:02.948 --> 05:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
Dr Mano talking about small Hydro class
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
4 and then you brought up that you're uh
 
05:24:09.788 --> 05:24:09.798 align:start position:0%
benefiting for a portion of your recent
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
investment in class one which is New
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
Generation would you um could you
 
05:24:19.510 --> 05:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
comment on whether the class
 
05:24:23.548 --> 05:24:23.558 align:start position:0%
one uh wrecks are designed to Spur
 
05:24:25.070 --> 05:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
Innovation because it would seem to me
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
that people might be more reluctant to
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
invest if they didn't have that category
 
05:24:32.548 --> 05:24:32.558 align:start position:0%
of Rec so I just think for the benefit
 
05:24:35.150 --> 05:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee just maybe understand
 
05:24:37.350 --> 05:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
you're investing are you investing in
 
05:24:40.350 --> 05:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
part because you qualif for certainly in
 
05:24:42.910 --> 05:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
part because we qualify for uh the these
 
05:24:46.030 --> 05:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits remember the H
 
05:24:47.788 --> 05:24:47.798 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier Hydro is the longest
 
05:24:50.430 --> 05:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
10e generator on the system these are
 
05:24:52.788 --> 05:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
long investments in Hydro are long
 
05:24:54.430 --> 05:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
duration Investments they're not you
 
05:24:58.030 --> 05:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
know solar met last 20 years a hydro uh
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
type of uh uh infrastructure lasts 40 50
 
05:25:04.110 --> 05:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
60 years a dam and you know the General
 
05:25:06.590 --> 05:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
Life of a dam is considered 80 years
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
many of our dams are a lot older than
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
that because we've been making
 
05:25:12.510 --> 05:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
consistent Investments so the time
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
Horizon the payback Horizon on the
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
Investments that you make in Hydro are
 
05:25:18.470 --> 05:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
extremely long and to make that you have
 
05:25:19.868 --> 05:25:19.878 align:start position:0%
to have certain assumptions that you're
 
05:25:21.628 --> 05:25:21.638 align:start position:0%
building into that now uh to the
 
05:25:23.670 --> 05:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative's earlier point that
 
05:25:25.510 --> 05:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
everything has risk and that's why we're
 
05:25:27.310 --> 05:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
glad that we're Diversified in multiple
 
05:25:29.430 --> 05:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
different markets to help absorb some of
 
05:25:31.670 --> 05:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
that risk but like I said the
 
05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
deregulation of these markets has driven
 
05:25:36.430 --> 05:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
so much efficiency into these that
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's very little wiggling left
 
05:25:41.150 --> 05:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
um you know I I I laugh when people
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
think you know a lot of people treat
 
05:25:44.750 --> 05:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
hydrop power as oh that's been there
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
forever it's been fully depreciated we
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to continue to pay for that
 
05:25:50.310 --> 05:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
anymore you know they you know people
 
05:25:53.708 --> 05:25:53.718 align:start position:0%
claim they're like water-powered ATMs uh
 
05:25:56.150 --> 05:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
we wish but uh just like you know you
 
05:25:58.030 --> 05:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
have to continually invest in your roads
 
05:25:59.470 --> 05:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
and your Bridges and other major
 
05:26:01.150 --> 05:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure require continual
 
05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
investment and investment in this type
 
05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
of infrastructure these types of
 
05:26:07.150 --> 05:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
equipment are massive Investments that
 
05:26:10.628 --> 05:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
have a very long long payback
 
05:26:13.628 --> 05:26:13.638 align:start position:0%
period follow up so we talk a lot about
 
05:26:16.110 --> 05:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
how we're interested in Innovation and
 
05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
new technologies and that sort of thing
 
05:26:18.480 --> 05:26:19.948 align:start position:0%
new technologies and that sort of thing
um

05:26:19.948 --> 05:26:19.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:23.788 --> 05:26:23.798 align:start position:0%
and you're a hydro uh person but we're
 
05:26:25.830 --> 05:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
new generation is actually a category in
 
05:26:25.840 --> 05:26:26.430 align:start position:0%
new generation is actually a category in
the

05:26:26.430 --> 05:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:26:28.910 --> 05:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
RPS um I'm looking at it and thinking
 
05:26:30.548 --> 05:26:30.558 align:start position:0%
I'm making that connection in my mind
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
that if you want Innovation then you
 
05:26:35.190 --> 05:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
should be having an incentive program
 
05:26:37.830 --> 05:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
that says to people invest here and it's
 
05:26:39.390 --> 05:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
okay we're not going to pull the rug out
 
05:26:41.788 --> 05:26:41.798 align:start position:0%
from under the making the economics work
 
05:26:44.350 --> 05:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
because often times as you said those
 
05:26:46.510 --> 05:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
Investments don't return they're
 
05:26:48.350 --> 05:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
long-term Investments right so they have
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
to have something stable right that's
 
05:26:53.708 --> 05:26:53.718 align:start position:0%
correct and we for you know to use I'll
 
05:26:55.470 --> 05:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
use the example of the Littleton project
 
05:26:57.750 --> 05:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
as the example again about $20 million
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
investment that we made in this 4.7
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
megawatt unit which we essentially
 
05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
strapped on to an existing Dam an
 
05:27:05.670 --> 05:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
existing station so built this
 
05:27:08.750 --> 05:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
efficiency into it um
 
05:27:11.390 --> 05:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
we when we were relicensed the last time
 
05:27:13.310 --> 05:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
at that facility we were required at
 
05:27:15.670 --> 05:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
that point to pass 300 cubic feet per
 
05:27:19.110 --> 05:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
second at all times through that Dam uh
 
05:27:20.430 --> 05:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
cubic foot's about the size of a
 
05:27:23.030 --> 05:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
basketball so people have a visual here
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
um we were passing 300 cubic feet per
 
05:27:29.150 --> 05:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
second through 40 megawatt units to try
 
05:27:31.708 --> 05:27:31.718 align:start position:0%
to spin this giant unit with this little
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
volume of water that's hydraulically
 
05:27:36.430 --> 05:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
efficient at multiple thousands of CFS
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
and so we were spinning this J unit with
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
300 CFS but at a very low efficiency
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
like 18 or 19% so we were generating
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
power with it but it was not had very
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
low efficiency so what we did was we
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
took that that same volume of water and
 
05:27:53.230 --> 05:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
put it through an appropriately sized
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
unit that we can now generate 27,000
 
05:27:58.230 --> 05:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
more megawatt hours a year simply
 
05:28:00.270 --> 05:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
because it's doing so more
 
05:28:02.910 --> 05:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
efficiently uh and you know again that
 
05:28:04.910 --> 05:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
investment $20 million worth of
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
investment if you check power prices you
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
know uh most the time they're very very
 
05:28:11.750 --> 05:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
low in the Wholesale Electric and
 
05:28:13.830 --> 05:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
they've been getting lower and lower and
 
05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
so to try to just just make that
 
05:28:18.788 --> 05:28:18.798 align:start position:0%
investment based on that loan is really
 
05:28:20.830 --> 05:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to to justify so it's it's
 
05:28:22.350 --> 05:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
because of these markets and because of
 
05:28:23.948 --> 05:28:23.958 align:start position:0%
the robust nature of these markets we're
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
that representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:28:33.070 --> 05:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
05:28:35.708 --> 05:28:35.718 align:start position:0%
you for being here um you mentioned it
 
05:28:38.110 --> 05:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
during your testimony and on page two it
 
05:28:40.270 --> 05:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
says that you pay $1 million a year in
 
05:28:42.708 --> 05:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
property taxes that's that's a lot of
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
money um if the RPS were phased out I'm
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
assuming you would be in in a little bit
 
05:28:52.230 --> 05:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
of financial trouble and you mentioned
 
05:28:54.948 --> 05:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
that a lot of your land is open to the
 
05:28:57.708 --> 05:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
public would that land be in Jeopardy of
 
05:29:00.390 --> 05:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
being sold for development if the RPS
 
05:29:03.270 --> 05:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
were were phased out so all of our land
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
almost all of our 30,000 acres of land
 
05:29:06.990 --> 05:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
are subject to conservation easements
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
that protect it from other types of
 
05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
development we have the ability to you
 
05:29:12.070 --> 05:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
know use the property obviously for
 
05:29:13.628 --> 05:29:13.638 align:start position:0%
Hydro power generating and and
 
05:29:15.910 --> 05:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
transmission and that kind of thing um
 
05:29:18.270 --> 05:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
because uh but that was a license
 
05:29:20.110 --> 05:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
requirement you know every time we go
 
05:29:21.948 --> 05:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
through a licensing all of our
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
facilities we get the the regulations
 
05:29:25.868 --> 05:29:25.878 align:start position:0%
get more and more and more restrictive
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
we can do less and less with our hydrop
 
05:29:30.110 --> 05:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
power so we have three generating
 
05:29:32.750 --> 05:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
stations on the Connecticut uh Vernon
 
05:29:36.548 --> 05:29:36.558 align:start position:0%
Bellows Falls and Wilder um in Hinsdale
 
05:29:40.510 --> 05:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh Walpole and uh Lebanon New
 
05:29:42.670 --> 05:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all going through relicensing
 
05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
um and we are I laugh it's I want to cry
 
05:29:48.990 --> 05:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
when I say it we're 13 years into a five
 
05:29:51.430 --> 05:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
and a half year process for
 
05:29:54.150 --> 05:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
relicensing and uh that process is going
 
05:29:56.470 --> 05:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
to restrict our ability to have as much
 
05:29:59.310 --> 05:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
operational um flexibility as we used to
 
05:30:01.350 --> 05:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
have and that means we're going to have
 
05:30:03.510 --> 05:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
less capability of of dispatching we're
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to have less capability of peaking
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to have less it's just less
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
of everything because that's what's
 
05:30:11.910 --> 05:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
happens every time you go through
 
05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
licensing so uh that's a financial
 
05:30:18.910 --> 05:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
burden on us obviously um but you know
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
when our properties are evaluated from a
 
05:30:24.030 --> 05:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
from a property tax perspective it's
 
05:30:26.708 --> 05:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
typically done on an income basis right
 
05:30:28.350 --> 05:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
U so these are Income generating
 
05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
properties and so uh the appraiser will
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
look at all of our revenues that we make
 
05:30:35.868 --> 05:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
and apply you know on all of our costs
 
05:30:38.030 --> 05:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
and then create a value for the property
 
05:30:40.868 --> 05:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
obviously if our revenues go down our
 
05:30:43.868 --> 05:30:43.878 align:start position:0%
value goes down our property taxes go
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
down so even if you just look at it
 
05:30:48.948 --> 05:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
specifically from that angle um it could
 
05:30:51.070 --> 05:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
have a potential negativea impact on
 
05:30:53.030 --> 05:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
followup follow up um you say that uh
 
05:30:58.510 --> 05:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
the property taxes are for 19 different
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions do you have just an
 
05:31:05.270 --> 05:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
estimate of of the impact to some New
 
05:31:08.430 --> 05:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire towns of the increase in
 
05:31:11.190 --> 05:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
property tax well in I can tell you in
 
05:31:13.750 --> 05:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
some communities we represent upwards of
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
40 to 50% of the total tax revenue that
 
05:31:20.270 --> 05:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
those communities take in so we are
 
05:31:22.470 --> 05:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
we're not the biggest we are by far the
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
biggest taxpayer in those communities
 
05:31:26.990 --> 05:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
and so it can have a real significant
 
05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
impact thank you
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
y okay seeing no further questions thank
 
05:31:35.070 --> 05:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
you very much we'll call next on Charlie
 
05:31:40.548 --> 05:31:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr nebling good afternoon
 
05:31:45.150 --> 05:31:45.160 align:start position:0%
welcome back to St thank you thank you
 
05:31:45.160 --> 05:31:46.030 align:start position:0%
welcome back to St thank you thank you
Mr

Mr
 
05:31:49.070 --> 05:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the of the committee
 
05:31:51.430 --> 05:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Charlie nebling I live in
 
05:31:52.708 --> 05:31:52.718 align:start position:0%
bosow in New
 
05:31:56.590 --> 05:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am a self-employed
 
05:31:59.310 --> 05:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
Forester and I've spent the
 
05:32:02.590 --> 05:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
last I don't know 15 years of my career
 
05:32:06.030 --> 05:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
involved in supporting and advocating in
 
05:32:09.110 --> 05:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
support of uh the responsible use of
 
05:32:12.430 --> 05:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
wood to make energy primarily focus on
 
05:32:15.030 --> 05:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
heat but also combined heat and power
 
05:32:18.030 --> 05:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
and power generation in the state of New
 
05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um part of my my work has
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
involved assisting and
 
05:32:25.590 --> 05:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
supporting uh institutions
 
05:32:29.628 --> 05:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities counties and others in
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
exploring the option of of modern wood
 
05:32:34.948 --> 05:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
heat and combined heat and power as an
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
alternative to to the use of fossil fuel
 
05:32:40.270 --> 05:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
TOS for heating mostly in parts of the
 
05:32:42.590 --> 05:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
state probably entirely in parts of the
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
state that don't have access to pipeline
 
05:32:45.120 --> 05:32:46.110 align:start position:0%
state that don't have access to pipeline
natural

05:32:46.110 --> 05:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
natural
 
05:32:48.910 --> 05:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
gas uh so they're stuck with oil or
 
05:32:51.948 --> 05:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
propane essentially for for heating on
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
on any kind of meaningful scale I've
 
05:32:58.070 --> 05:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
seen firsthand in that work through
 
05:33:02.030 --> 05:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
feasibility analysis financial analysis
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%

Grant

05:33:05.548 --> 05:33:05.558 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
05:33:09.150 --> 05:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
resources uh to to help with the
 
05:33:12.750 --> 05:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
significant Capital cost of this modern
 
05:33:15.390 --> 05:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
Uh Wood technology I've seen firsthand
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
the impact that
 
05:33:23.390 --> 05:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
Rex electric thermal have on the
 
05:33:25.628 --> 05:33:25.638 align:start position:0%
economics of these projects and I just
 
05:33:28.470 --> 05:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
want to leave you with an economic
 
05:33:30.708 --> 05:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
argument you're you're going to hear
 
05:33:33.548 --> 05:33:33.558 align:start position:0%
lots of testimony today on this bill and
 
05:33:34.590 --> 05:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
the one to
 
05:33:38.750 --> 05:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:41.990 --> 05:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
as I stated a week or two ago on House
 
05:33:44.788 --> 05:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
Bill 224 a reminder to the committee
 
05:33:47.230 --> 05:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
that we we import most of the energy
 
05:33:48.948 --> 05:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
that we use in this state we are we
 
05:33:53.070 --> 05:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't produce fossil fuel we export
 
05:33:56.510 --> 05:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars a year and I I went
 
05:33:59.070 --> 05:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
hunting in the most recent State Energy
 
05:34:01.548 --> 05:34:01.558 align:start position:0%
report trying to find the figure from
 
05:34:04.110 --> 05:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
the 22 Energy report I couldn't find it
 
05:34:06.030 --> 05:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to keep hunting Mr
 
05:34:09.110 --> 05:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
chairman but but years ago it was like 3
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
to four billion a year that hemorrhages
 
05:34:15.310 --> 05:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
out of the state because of the oil coal
 
05:34:17.470 --> 05:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
natural gas and propane that we depend
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
on for transportation Heating and
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
electricity so I'm I'm going to make a
 
05:34:28.030 --> 05:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
purely economic argument to you and
 
05:34:32.948 --> 05:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
state that Republicans Democrats
 
05:34:36.750 --> 05:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
Independence uh all ought to embrace the
 
05:34:38.830 --> 05:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
goal of reducing ing that Hemorrhage of
 
05:34:41.590 --> 05:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
wealth from our state by producing more
 
05:34:44.910 --> 05:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
of what we can within this the state to
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
displace what we were we are otherwise
 
05:34:50.110 --> 05:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
dependent on from other states or other
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
countries there's so much common
 
05:34:54.830 --> 05:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work together there and
 
05:34:57.230 --> 05:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
focus on that goal and to the extent
 
05:35:01.670 --> 05:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
that the RPS helps us uh by establishing
 
05:35:05.070 --> 05:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
a Statewide platform policy platform to
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
achieve that goal in part I support it
 
05:35:13.430 --> 05:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I would encourage you to to vote this
 
05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill in expedient or perhaps uh
 
05:35:20.390 --> 05:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
transition it into a study bill to
 
05:35:23.868 --> 05:35:23.878 align:start position:0%
evaluate the broader goal of
 
05:35:25.948 --> 05:35:25.958 align:start position:0%
comprehensive policy review on what we
 
05:35:28.430 --> 05:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
can do to keep more of our wealth in the
 
05:35:31.230 --> 05:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
state and be less dependent on other
 
05:35:33.670 --> 05:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
people's energy and achieve a measure of
 
05:35:36.150 --> 05:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
sovereignty that we don't otherwise
 
05:35:39.948 --> 05:35:39.958 align:start position:0%
benefit from that's it thank you thank
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
you Charlie I know you know a lot about
 
05:35:43.310 --> 05:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
the RPS I'm going to ask you this
 
05:35:46.470 --> 05:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
question sure are there any
 
05:35:50.590 --> 05:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities within the existing law to
 
05:35:54.270 --> 05:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
save more money for rate payers for
 
05:35:57.350 --> 05:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
example with eliminating classes so that
 
05:35:59.270 --> 05:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
all Renewables compete against each
 
05:36:04.270 --> 05:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:09.750 --> 05:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
run it it might uh potentially
 
05:36:13.990 --> 05:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
benefit technologies that can compete or
 
05:36:17.948 --> 05:36:17.958 align:start position:0%
for which the the value of Rex at a
 
05:36:20.948 --> 05:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
lower level is sufficient to provide
 
05:36:23.548 --> 05:36:23.558 align:start position:0%
them the competitive advantage that they
 
05:36:26.628 --> 05:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
need but there's a very important reason
 
05:36:30.868 --> 05:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
why House Bill 873 17 years ago created
 
05:36:33.510 --> 05:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
separate classes so that they compete
 
05:36:36.628 --> 05:36:36.638 align:start position:0%
within a technology category and not
 
05:36:38.590 --> 05:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
among technology ology
 
05:36:38.600 --> 05:36:40.310 align:start position:0%
among technology ology
categories

05:36:40.310 --> 05:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
categories
 
05:36:44.110 --> 05:36:44.120 align:start position:0%
um I would remind the committee that 12
 
05:36:47.070 --> 05:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
years ago primarily because it was a
 
05:36:50.070 --> 05:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
cost-saving measure a small piece of
 
05:36:52.270 --> 05:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
class one was carved out and allocated
 
05:36:54.990 --> 05:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
to Thermal at a lower alternative
 
05:36:57.548 --> 05:36:57.558 align:start position:0%
compliance rate or cealing
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
price because thermal can compete at a
 
05:37:04.708 --> 05:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
lower cost than electric generation that
 
05:37:07.070 --> 05:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
was a cost-saving measure it's the only
 
05:37:07.080 --> 05:37:08.070 align:start position:0%
was a cost-saving measure it's the only
reason

05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
reason
 
05:37:11.150 --> 05:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
that bill passed uh during the time that
 
05:37:12.788 --> 05:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
that Bill O'Brien was speaker of the
 
05:37:16.190 --> 05:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
house it was the only reason so yes
 
05:37:18.670 --> 05:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities to find savings
 
05:37:21.510 --> 05:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that lumping classes is
 
05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to achieve the goal
 
05:37:25.548 --> 05:37:25.558 align:start position:0%
that you you think it will it certainly
 
05:37:29.190 --> 05:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
would harm uh fuel
 
05:37:32.350 --> 05:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
diversity okay we'll talk more about
 
05:37:35.150 --> 05:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
class one thermal in the next bill yes
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you next up
 
05:37:40.510 --> 05:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
let's get Sam Evans Brown back up here
 
05:37:42.910 --> 05:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
to U give us
 
05:37:47.948 --> 05:37:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:50.910 --> 05:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
points does from very often I'd love to
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
put my time the end
 
05:37:56.990 --> 05:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay um how about then
 
05:38:00.430 --> 05:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
um Sheila Connelly of holderness
 
05:38:00.440 --> 05:38:05.868 align:start position:0%
um Sheila Connelly of holderness
representing

05:38:05.868 --> 05:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
RMI hello Miss
 
05:38:12.030 --> 05:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:14.470 --> 05:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon my name is Sheila
 
05:38:16.990 --> 05:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
Connelly and the RMI ref refers to the
 
05:38:18.830 --> 05:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
name of my company which is Resource
 
05:38:22.310 --> 05:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
Management Inc and our company is based
 
05:38:25.150 --> 05:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
up in holderness and we were born 30
 
05:38:27.948 --> 05:38:27.958 align:start position:0%
years ago because of the biomass
 
05:38:31.708 --> 05:38:31.718 align:start position:0%
industry our company's first job was to
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
recycle the 5,000 tons of wood ash that
 
05:38:40.230 --> 05:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
are the by byproduct of biomass power
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
and what I want to just point out is
 
05:38:46.670 --> 05:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
that not unlike what Charlie was just
 
05:38:49.590 --> 05:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
describing about all of our wealth being
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
exported um when we have uh fossil fuels
 
05:38:57.430 --> 05:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
rather than local renewable energy um so
 
05:38:59.788 --> 05:38:59.798 align:start position:0%
the unintended benefit from investing in
 
05:39:02.670 --> 05:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
biomass so many years ago uh and then
 
05:39:06.788 --> 05:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
subsequent RPS investment has been to
 
05:39:09.070 --> 05:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
help our New Hampshire farmers in ways
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
that nobody had
 
05:39:13.948 --> 05:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
foreseen um part of growing crops in New
 
05:39:18.150 --> 05:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
England and anywhere requires um three
 
05:39:22.590 --> 05:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
nutrients n nitrogen phosphorus and
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
potassium in New England we don't have
 
05:39:28.270 --> 05:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
pottassium mines to provide this very
 
05:39:30.150 --> 05:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
important piece of the fertilizer
 
05:39:33.468 --> 05:39:33.478 align:start position:0%
equation at the scale that's needed in
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
fact in the United States we have the
 
05:39:40.350 --> 05:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
the majority of our podes comes from New
 
05:39:43.150 --> 05:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
Mexico and that is not enough for our
 
05:39:46.270 --> 05:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
country in fact we are the 10th larg
 
05:39:49.628 --> 05:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
10th largest potash Source in on the
 
05:39:53.750 --> 05:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
planet and we get our poach from uh
 
05:39:56.468 --> 05:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
Russia the Soviet Union
 
05:39:59.670 --> 05:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
former um China is a is the second
 
05:40:02.190 --> 05:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
largest and the third that we are
 
05:40:05.708 --> 05:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
dealing with our partner is Canada now
 
05:40:07.948 --> 05:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
the tariffs that are being
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
bandied about are really going to hurt
 
05:40:12.708 --> 05:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
our Farmers here in New England and in
 
05:40:14.788 --> 05:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire remember we're here to
 
05:40:17.590 --> 05:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
talk about the RPS I understand
 
05:40:20.468 --> 05:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
sir and I think it's really important to
 
05:40:22.990 --> 05:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
understand that it's not just the
 
05:40:25.390 --> 05:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
electricity that's being created it's
 
05:40:27.430 --> 05:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
all of the things that are related to
 
05:40:30.468 --> 05:40:30.478 align:start position:0%
that type of electricity and uh one of
 
05:40:32.270 --> 05:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
the things that's nice for New Hampshire
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
Farmers is that they are able to take
 
05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
the chips that are harvested from the
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
forest processed into clean electricity
 
05:40:42.468 --> 05:40:42.478 align:start position:0%
at these biomass plants and then that
 
05:40:44.548 --> 05:40:44.558 align:start position:0%
wood ash comes back to their Farm fields
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
to grow crop for New Hampshire this is a
 
05:40:50.948 --> 05:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
very important piece of the puzzle often
 
05:40:53.830 --> 05:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
overlooked and un and understood and so
 
05:40:56.788 --> 05:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
I just think it's really um important to
 
05:40:59.350 --> 05:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
look at the whole package and say you
 
05:41:01.948 --> 05:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
know Hydro is good for these reasons
 
05:41:04.390 --> 05:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
wind is good for this solar's good for
 
05:41:07.350 --> 05:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
that and the biomass has a place here
 
05:41:09.390 --> 05:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
the only way these biomass plants can
 
05:41:12.190 --> 05:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
remain viable and continue is through
 
05:41:15.468 --> 05:41:15.478 align:start position:0%
this RPS program so for today I did
 
05:41:19.548 --> 05:41:19.558 align:start position:0%
bring a copy of my testimony as well as
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
I have little baggies of wood ash for
 
05:41:24.070 --> 05:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
each of you this is a wonderful
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
fertilizer product and you should put it
 
05:41:28.150 --> 05:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
on your Tomatoes or your pumpkins or
 
05:41:31.510 --> 05:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
whatever you grow um and I can hand out
 
05:41:35.628 --> 05:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
both these samples as well as my
 
05:41:38.230 --> 05:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
testimony okay thank thank you very
 
05:41:41.708 --> 05:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
much questions for miss
 
05:41:45.150 --> 05:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
commy seeing none we'll turn next to
 
05:41:53.948 --> 05:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:56.230 --> 05:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
grimas welcome back to the two of you
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:11.670 --> 05:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:13.230 --> 05:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:42:14.868 --> 05:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
05:42:17.190 --> 05:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
Jody grimus I'm here with Michael O
 
05:42:19.070 --> 05:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
who's the asset manager for Bridgewater
 
05:42:21.030 --> 05:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
power company I know a few of you have
 
05:42:22.830 --> 05:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
come up to visit the plant for those
 
05:42:24.628 --> 05:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
that have never have we'd love to have
 
05:42:26.430 --> 05:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
you come up to visit the biomass plant
 
05:42:28.590 --> 05:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
in Bridgewater I'm assuming we're just
 
05:42:31.030 --> 05:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
speaking to 219 right now Mr chairman
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
right because you want us to speak to
 
05:42:34.468 --> 05:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
later okay because I've held my card for
 
05:42:36.590 --> 05:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
that one um I'm going to have Mike talk
 
05:42:38.948 --> 05:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit about why we're opposed to
 
05:42:40.948 --> 05:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
this phase out of the RPS and how it
 
05:42:43.270 --> 05:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
benefits um particularly in the area of
 
05:42:45.510 --> 05:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
biomass which is class three and then if
 
05:42:47.230 --> 05:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
you have questions we'll go through it
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
what I've passed out to you um is
 
05:42:53.910 --> 05:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
actually a study that was done uh at the
 
05:42:55.990 --> 05:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
at the behest of this legislature U
 
05:42:58.510 --> 05:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
actually representative Thomas was the
 
05:43:01.548 --> 05:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
um sponsor of house bill 10005 that
 
05:43:04.788 --> 05:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
talked about a um commission to look at
 
05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
the low grade Timber industry um and
 
05:43:09.430 --> 05:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
what the needs were in New Hampshire and
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
I would just point out it's highlighted
 
05:43:15.350 --> 05:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
in your in your report it just came out
 
05:43:17.670 --> 05:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
in 2003 chairman harb from house
 
05:43:19.150 --> 05:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
resources was the chair of that
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
commission but on page four it talked
 
05:43:24.110 --> 05:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
about how important this industry is to
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and it talked about how
 
05:43:28.270 --> 05:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we need to do is
 
05:43:31.510 --> 05:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
support the renewable portfolio standard
 
05:43:34.270 --> 05:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
support um biomass power and low-grade
 
05:43:36.788 --> 05:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
Timber so that is for your information
 
05:43:38.910 --> 05:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a study that was just done
 
05:43:38.920 --> 05:43:40.230 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a study that was just done
in

05:43:40.230 --> 05:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:43:42.788 --> 05:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
2023 and it shows about the importance
 
05:43:44.548 --> 05:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
their ultimate recommendation and
 
05:43:46.430 --> 05:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion was that it's a very
 
05:43:48.270 --> 05:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
important industry to New Hampshire and
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
should be supported at all levels of
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
government and state agencies and they
 
05:43:54.270 --> 05:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
specifically touted supporting the
 
05:43:55.830 --> 05:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard so I'll
 
05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
turn it to Mike to talk a little bit
 
05:43:59.590 --> 05:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
more about
 
05:44:01.708 --> 05:44:01.718 align:start position:0%
biomass well Mr chairman members of the
 
05:44:03.548 --> 05:44:03.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for
 
05:44:06.230 --> 05:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify as Jody said my
 
05:44:07.788 --> 05:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
name is Michael oier I'm the asset
 
05:44:09.670 --> 05:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
manager of Bridgewater power company
 
05:44:12.628 --> 05:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
we're a 15 megawatt biomass plant in
 
05:44:14.190 --> 05:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater New
 
05:44:16.070 --> 05:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I come before the committee
 
05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
today obviously opposed to House Bill
 
05:44:20.590 --> 05:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
219 and I strongly encourage the
 
05:44:23.230 --> 05:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
committee to vote it an expedient to
 
05:44:25.548 --> 05:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
legislate I've testified many times
 
05:44:28.430 --> 05:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
before the committee and uh can
 
05:44:30.070 --> 05:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
certainly tell the committee members a
 
05:44:31.708 --> 05:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
lot about the history of the biomass
 
05:44:33.990 --> 05:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
plants and I'm happy to do that at the
 
05:44:37.030 --> 05:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
end of my testimony while I only
 
05:44:38.990 --> 05:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
represent Bridgewater virtually all of
 
05:44:40.830 --> 05:44:40.840 align:start position:0%

05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
just at our facility alone our facility
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
purchases 200 to 220,000 tons of holtry
 
05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
chips annually with a value of
 
05:45:13.590 --> 05:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 5 to 66.5 million these
 
05:45:15.948 --> 05:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
chips come from all corners of the state
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
and come from a number of different
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
sources traditional forestry is only one
 
05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
of those sources others are land
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
clearing for roads and housing
 
05:45:27.150 --> 05:45:27.160 align:start position:0%

05:45:44.110 --> 05:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned stay in the state and have the
 
05:45:46.390 --> 05:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect in the New Hampshire
 
05:45:49.670 --> 05:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
economy since 2007 programs to promote
 
05:45:52.350 --> 05:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
renewable generation were initiated many
 
05:45:55.150 --> 05:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
states across the country these programs
 
05:45:56.830 --> 05:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
have universally been referred to as
 
05:45:59.070 --> 05:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standards and
 
05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
commercially salable product derived
 
05:46:02.750 --> 05:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
from these programs are called renewable
 
05:46:05.910 --> 05:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
energy certificates a wreck is
 
05:46:07.788 --> 05:46:07.798 align:start position:0%

05:46:10.628 --> 05:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
megawatt of Generation by a renewable
 
05:46:13.310 --> 05:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
resource our facility has three salable
 
05:46:16.110 --> 05:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
products our energy our capacity and our
 
05:46:18.430 --> 05:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates these
 
05:46:20.430 --> 05:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
recks are critical to the viability of
 
05:46:23.310 --> 05:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
our facility we will be out of business
 
05:46:25.990 --> 05:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
without the ability to sell Rex into a
 
05:46:29.110 --> 05:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
viable New Hampshire class 3 Market this
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill eliminates that product and that
 
05:46:33.990 --> 05:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
market it is very important for members
 
05:46:36.390 --> 05:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee to know that from 2007
 
05:46:37.868 --> 05:46:37.878 align:start position:0%
to 20
 
05:46:41.190 --> 05:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
2015 and very significantly from
 
05:46:45.390 --> 05:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
2015 until currently the New Hampshire
 
05:46:47.468 --> 05:46:47.478 align:start position:0%
class 3 plants were in actuality
 
05:46:50.548 --> 05:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
supported by the Connecticut RPS program
 
05:46:51.948 --> 05:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
and the cost to New Hampshire rate
 
05:46:53.670 --> 05:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
payers was
 
05:46:56.030 --> 05:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
negligible rrex was sold into the
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
Connecticut program the new yet today
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire program is
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
significantly more important to us as
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has reduced our ability to
 
05:47:06.948 --> 05:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
sell into their Market
 
05:47:08.590 --> 05:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
one extremely important thing to
 
05:47:10.750 --> 05:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
understand about the RPS program is that
 
05:47:13.030 --> 05:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
the State's Department of energy has the
 
05:47:15.548 --> 05:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
legal authority to adjust the purchase
 
05:47:18.110 --> 05:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
requirement for Rex already and they
 
05:47:21.468 --> 05:47:21.478 align:start position:0%
have done that many times in the past
 
05:47:23.150 --> 05:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
the last two years for example the
 
05:47:25.150 --> 05:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
purchase requirement has has been
 
05:47:27.230 --> 05:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
dropped to
 
05:47:29.350 --> 05:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
.5% from the
 
05:47:29.360 --> 05:47:32.150 align:start position:0%
.5% from the
statutory

05:47:32.150 --> 05:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
05:47:34.910 --> 05:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
8% therefore this bill is not required
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
for the purchase requirement to be
 
05:47:38.788 --> 05:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
lowered the biomass industry supported
 
05:47:41.548 --> 05:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
these reductions and testified in in
 
05:47:44.548 --> 05:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
support of the change at the doe when we
 
05:47:47.390 --> 05:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
knew we had our our recre sold into the
 
05:47:50.430 --> 05:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Market working openly and
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
transparently with both New Hampshire
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
doe and New Hampshire Dees the biomass
 
05:47:58.708 --> 05:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
industry has been a model of success for
 
05:48:01.110 --> 05:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
other states in the country it is
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat disingenuous to frame this bill
 
05:48:05.708 --> 05:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
as a vehicle to provide significant rate
 
05:48:05.718 --> 05:48:07.270 align:start position:0%
as a vehicle to provide significant rate
relief

05:48:07.270 --> 05:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
relief
 
05:48:09.750 --> 05:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
each year doe issues an annual report
 
05:48:12.430 --> 05:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
about the RPS program the most recent
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
report was issued
 
05:48:18.910 --> 05:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
11124 in that report on page 14 it shows
 
05:48:21.468 --> 05:48:21.478 align:start position:0%
that the entire RPS program not just
 
05:48:26.350 --> 05:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
class three the entire RPS program adds
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
0.33 cents per kilowatt
 
05:48:32.708 --> 05:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
hour utilities generally use a 600 KW
 
05:48:36.270 --> 05:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
hour average for a residential customer
 
05:48:39.030 --> 05:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
doing simple math a customer would save
 
05:48:42.030 --> 05:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
approximately $1.98 a month if you
 
05:48:44.390 --> 05:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
eliminated the entire
 
05:48:46.788 --> 05:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
program the state will have lost all the
 
05:48:48.750 --> 05:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
benefits mentioned earlier and in
 
05:48:50.990 --> 05:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
addition to those benefits the power
 
05:48:53.390 --> 05:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
generated from our stability from our
 
05:48:56.070 --> 05:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
facilities stabilizes the grid and
 
05:48:58.628 --> 05:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
lowers both hourly Energy prices and
 
05:49:01.628 --> 05:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
capacity costs as we sell as what is
 
05:49:04.948 --> 05:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
defined as a price taker and I'm happy
 
05:49:07.150 --> 05:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
to explain that at the end of my test
 
05:49:09.390 --> 05:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
testimony reviewing the most recent
 
05:49:12.708 --> 05:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
forward capacity auction if 100 fewer
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
megawatts were bid into that auction
 
05:49:16.750 --> 05:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
which is what would happen if all of
 
05:49:19.670 --> 05:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
these facilities closed New Hampshire's
 
05:49:21.310 --> 05:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
share of the capacity cost would
 
05:49:23.948 --> 05:49:23.958 align:start position:0%
increase by over 13.5
 
05:49:26.830 --> 05:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
million in closing again i' strongly
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote this bill
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate I would like to
 
05:49:37.510 --> 05:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
just uh make one point about rate pay is
 
05:49:39.628 --> 05:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
being smart or being dumb or whatever it
 
05:49:42.590 --> 05:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
might be and I think that I'd rather
 
05:49:44.110 --> 05:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
rather than think of them that way I'd
 
05:49:45.590 --> 05:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
rather think of them as maybe kind of
 
05:49:48.548 --> 05:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
using their Yankee common sense and
 
05:49:50.230 --> 05:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that the electric grid is
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
pretty complicated and they don't
 
05:49:54.310 --> 05:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the expertise to know
 
05:49:56.708 --> 05:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
how to deal with that and if you look on
 
05:49:58.310 --> 05:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
ISO New England's
 
05:50:01.788 --> 05:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
website you'll you'll very easily see
 
05:50:04.070 --> 05:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
this and it's pretty important ISO New
 
05:50:06.708 --> 05:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
England considers fuel diversity as a
 
05:50:08.750 --> 05:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
critical factor for maintaining system
 
05:50:11.548 --> 05:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
reliability in the region particularly
 
05:50:14.150 --> 05:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
due to New England's Reliance on natural
 
05:50:15.590 --> 05:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
gas and its
 
05:50:17.868 --> 05:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
vulnerability to potential Supply
 
05:50:20.510 --> 05:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
disruptions during Peak demand periods
 
05:50:23.390 --> 05:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
especially in the winter therefore ISO
 
05:50:25.670 --> 05:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
New England actively analyzes and
 
05:50:28.788 --> 05:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
promotes a mix of fuel sources to ensure
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
power generation stability across
 
05:50:34.628 --> 05:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
various scenarios including extreme
 
05:50:37.390 --> 05:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
weather events biom Mass power is a
 
05:50:39.708 --> 05:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
Basel loaded resource and we have bid
 
05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
into the system every day this
 
05:50:46.070 --> 05:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
winter happy to answer any questions
 
05:50:46.990 --> 05:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:50.110 --> 05:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee has one
 
05:50:53.070 --> 05:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr lei
 
05:50:56.548 --> 05:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I was
 
05:50:59.230 --> 05:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
copiously writing notes and you made I
 
05:51:01.190 --> 05:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
think a really important point when you
 
05:51:04.030 --> 05:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
said that if there were 100 fewer
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
megawatts if the biomass uh in New
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire went under that we would in
 
05:51:13.468 --> 05:51:13.478 align:start position:0%
turn have an increased capacity cost of
 
05:51:15.708 --> 05:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
13.5 million can you just explain that a
 
05:51:18.590 --> 05:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
little bit more yes when ISO New England
 
05:51:23.190 --> 05:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
does a capacity auction they start with
 
05:51:27.030 --> 05:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
a needed amount of power and they start
 
05:51:29.548 --> 05:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
with a base price the last auction
 
05:51:32.548 --> 05:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
started with a base price of
 
05:51:35.990 --> 05:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
$14.25 per kilowatt month and what
 
05:51:37.350 --> 05:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
happens is they do What's called the
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
declining clock auction and as more
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
megawatts go into the system then
 
05:51:45.628 --> 05:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
they're what considered their demand
 
05:51:48.230 --> 05:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that price of capacity goes
 
05:51:50.670 --> 05:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
down and it goes down further which
 
05:51:52.548 --> 05:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
actually makes the system more reliable
 
05:51:54.390 --> 05:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
because it means more megawatts than
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
they really require are going into the
 
05:51:59.070 --> 05:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
system but it brings the price of that
 
05:52:02.750 --> 05:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
capacity down because otherwise rate
 
05:52:04.788 --> 05:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
payers would be paying more than their
 
05:52:07.670 --> 05:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
actual demand requirement as it ratchets
 
05:52:11.590 --> 05:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
down until no more plants will bid
 
05:52:13.628 --> 05:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
there's a floor of
 
05:52:18.310 --> 05:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
$2 the last the last auction uh closed I
 
05:52:19.910 --> 05:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
believe it was
 
05:52:24.270 --> 05:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
$3.57 and so if 100 megawatts were out
 
05:52:26.510 --> 05:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
of that it would have closed higher up
 
05:52:27.788 --> 05:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
more at like
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
$383 and if you take New Hampshire's
 
05:52:32.110 --> 05:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
share of that it would have been $13.5
 
05:52:32.120 --> 05:52:36.628 align:start position:0%
share of that it would have been $13.5
million

05:52:36.628 --> 05:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:39.390 --> 05:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:52:41.990 --> 05:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you both for being here
 
05:52:44.788 --> 05:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
um Jody just as a point of clarification
 
05:52:47.590 --> 05:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that this report was the
 
05:52:50.270 --> 05:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
result of a bill by representative
 
05:52:52.070 --> 05:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas and because we have to do this
 
05:52:53.948 --> 05:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
all the time on this committee can you
 
05:52:55.830 --> 05:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
please identify which representative
 
05:52:59.788 --> 05:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
Thomas sure I'm sorry um it was House
 
05:53:02.830 --> 05:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
Bill U one5 by representative uh Doug
 
05:53:05.070 --> 05:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh chairman V was a co-sponsor
 
05:53:06.788 --> 05:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much as was Senate
 
05:53:08.350 --> 05:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
President Carson and Senate President
 
05:53:10.390 --> 05:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
back then um Jeff Bradley so it was a it
 
05:53:12.548 --> 05:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
was a thank you much appreciated thank
 
05:53:14.948 --> 05:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
you um can I just mention one last thing
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
I was thinking more about the Chairman's
 
05:53:18.868 --> 05:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
question about
 
05:53:22.070 --> 05:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
374f and the RPS and whether they were
 
05:53:27.070 --> 05:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
conflicting um I was around in um 1997
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
when the market was restructured um I
 
05:53:31.548 --> 05:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
actually see them as complimentary
 
05:53:35.948 --> 05:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
because as I look at the um the view of
 
05:53:37.708 --> 05:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
the electric Market the energy market
 
05:53:39.628 --> 05:53:39.638 align:start position:0%
and how the price of that wholesale
 
05:53:42.510 --> 05:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
energy has gone down I think that's what
 
05:53:44.510 --> 05:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
restructuring was thinking about was
 
05:53:45.750 --> 05:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
making sure the energy prices were
 
05:53:47.230 --> 05:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
continuing to go down that wholesale
 
05:53:49.548 --> 05:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
Market because of competition where I
 
05:53:52.270 --> 05:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
think RPS is complimentary is that it
 
05:53:55.830 --> 05:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
pushes that diversity and the diversity
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
if you have all your eggs in one basket
 
05:54:01.468 --> 05:54:01.478 align:start position:0%
I.E natural gas there is no competition
 
05:54:03.628 --> 05:54:03.638 align:start position:0%
and we get the spikes whether it's the
 
05:54:05.788 --> 05:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
Ukraine or the winter months or whatever
 
05:54:08.350 --> 05:54:08.360 align:start position:0%
it might be it's it's we can't we can't
 
05:54:11.390 --> 05:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
be upheld just by one kind of focus on
 
05:54:13.670 --> 05:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
energy so I think the RPS is
 
05:54:16.110 --> 05:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
complimentary to what we've seen which
 
05:54:18.948 --> 05:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
is successful restructuring where we've
 
05:54:21.190 --> 05:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
seen lower energy prices and electricity
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
prices on the wholesale Market but we
 
05:54:25.670 --> 05:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
have the benefit of that diversity of
 
05:54:29.468 --> 05:54:29.478 align:start position:0%
biomass Hydro coal this that like all
 
05:54:31.590 --> 05:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
the different types of energy generation
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
so I think that's where I see them as
 
05:54:34.030 --> 05:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
complimentary not
 
05:54:36.830 --> 05:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
conflicting thank you okay
 
05:54:39.070 --> 05:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative Swanson has a question
 
05:54:42.270 --> 05:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
we're down to about 18 cards here so
 
05:54:43.868 --> 05:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
okay so I should make it quick if my
 
05:54:45.350 --> 05:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
neighbor get we'll be leaving at five
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
minutes a five if we U so if this this
 
05:54:52.430 --> 05:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
bill proposes getting rid of the RPS or
 
05:54:55.788 --> 05:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
or effectively scaling it down and I
 
05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
think I heard you say that it would
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
equate to $1.98 a month per rate payer
 
05:55:03.670 --> 05:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
yes for for an average 600 most of the
 
05:55:06.030 --> 05:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
utilities when they when they represent
 
05:55:09.390 --> 05:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
an average rate payer they use 600 kilow
 
05:55:12.548 --> 05:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
so if my neighbor had this $1.98 a month
 
05:55:16.468 --> 05:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
back but also it sounds like the uh the
 
05:55:19.590 --> 05:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
the market for the gas fluctuates
 
05:55:21.910 --> 05:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
significantly would there be any way to
 
05:55:24.670 --> 05:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
distinguish whether they got their $198
 
05:55:27.590 --> 05:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
back no and I think we've all seen that
 
05:55:30.270 --> 05:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
when when a lot of the biomass plants
 
05:55:33.310 --> 05:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
were not producing power no nobody saw
 
05:55:36.670 --> 05:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
their rates go down at home and so was
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
there were a number of years where none
 
05:55:40.350 --> 05:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
of the bio I think Bridgewater was the
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
only one of the small biomass plants
 
05:55:44.670 --> 05:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
that actually stayed running the entire
 
05:55:47.590 --> 05:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
time nobody's nobody's rates went down
 
05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
and and and when we talk about subsidies
 
05:55:52.628 --> 05:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
and we talk about trying to be an even
 
05:55:56.788 --> 05:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
playing field every form of energy gets
 
05:55:59.390 --> 05:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
subsidies there there are investment tax
 
05:56:01.548 --> 05:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
credits there are production tax credits
 
05:56:03.948 --> 05:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
there are depletion allowances there are
 
05:56:05.948 --> 05:56:05.958 align:start position:0%
guaranteed loan funds for nuclear power
 
05:56:05.958 --> 05:56:07.070 align:start position:0%
guaranteed loan funds for nuclear power
plants

05:56:07.070 --> 05:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
plants
 
05:56:09.670 --> 05:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
if unless unless the committee thinks
 
05:56:12.190 --> 05:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
that they can somehow rewrite the
 
05:56:14.628 --> 05:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
federal energy code or the federal tax
 
05:56:18.628 --> 05:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
code you can't we have a hybrid system
 
05:56:20.708 --> 05:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
we we we really
 
05:56:23.708 --> 05:56:23.718 align:start position:0%
can't have say that everybody's
 
05:56:25.708 --> 05:56:25.718 align:start position:0%
competing on an even playing field there
 
05:56:27.670 --> 05:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's too there's there's too many
 
05:56:29.548 --> 05:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
complexities to the to the marketplace
 
05:56:31.390 --> 05:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
for energy thank you very much thank you
 
05:56:35.070 --> 05:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair okay representative Doug chair
 
05:56:36.628 --> 05:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas has a thank you Mr
 
05:56:39.070 --> 05:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question ju I
 
05:56:41.110 --> 05:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have a question until until you
 
05:56:43.708 --> 05:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned those last bit of facts can
 
05:56:45.350 --> 05:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
you tell me
 
05:56:48.990 --> 05:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
then of the subsidies you mentioned the
 
05:56:51.788 --> 05:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
long string of them which ones only come
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:56:55.510 --> 05:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
state which ones for us the only one
 
05:56:56.948 --> 05:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
which ones only come from the state of
 
05:56:58.708 --> 05:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
of the ones that you mentioned all the
 
05:57:00.430 --> 05:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
subsidies you mentioned for all the
 
05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
energy all over the country which ones
 
05:57:05.468 --> 05:57:05.478 align:start position:0%
come from are directed by by New
 
05:57:08.070 --> 05:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire renewable energy credits and
 
05:57:10.708 --> 05:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
many most most states in the country now
 
05:57:13.190 --> 05:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
have adopted renewable energy credits
 
05:57:15.270 --> 05:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
05:57:17.350 --> 05:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
yes therefore all the other ones you
 
05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned are all federal directed
 
05:57:22.468 --> 05:57:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:24.910 --> 05:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no more questions I want
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
to thank you two and invite Eric wormy
 
05:57:29.788 --> 05:57:29.798 align:start position:0%
to come talk to us he's from Bradford
 
05:57:29.798 --> 05:57:34.310 align:start position:0%
to come talk to us he's from Bradford
New

05:57:34.310 --> 05:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:36.468 --> 05:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good afternoon Eric good to
 
05:57:37.548 --> 05:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
see you
 
05:57:40.270 --> 05:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
again good afternoon guess I haven't
 
05:57:41.708 --> 05:57:41.718 align:start position:0%
seen you in quite a while so I haven't
 
05:57:45.868 --> 05:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
been here for all of the build today um
 
05:57:47.708 --> 05:57:47.718 align:start position:0%
one minor correction I live in Sutton my
 
05:57:49.510 --> 05:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
post office is
 
05:57:52.190 --> 05:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
Bradford okay somehow Sutton has five
 
05:57:55.070 --> 05:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:59.350 --> 05:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
codes um thank you for letting me speak
 
05:58:02.788 --> 05:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
here my testimony
 
05:58:05.830 --> 05:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
is kind of unique among everything else
 
05:58:05.840 --> 05:58:06.628 align:start position:0%
is kind of unique among everything else
here

05:58:06.628 --> 05:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:58:08.070 --> 05:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really fit to any of the
 
05:58:10.990 --> 05:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
bills but I wanted but looking at some
 
05:58:13.628 --> 05:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
of the other testimony for the
 
05:58:17.750 --> 05:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
bills none of them made any mention of
 
05:58:21.708 --> 05:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
the productivity that we need in
 
05:58:24.910 --> 05:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
producing power or anything else and how
 
05:58:26.750 --> 05:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
that productivity relates to our
 
05:58:28.190 --> 05:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
standard of
 
05:58:33.350 --> 05:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
living so the my concern is
 
05:58:37.390 --> 05:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
that for some of the
 
05:58:40.430 --> 05:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
generation schemes for wind power and
 
05:58:43.510 --> 05:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
solar for example those are both highly
 
05:58:45.990 --> 05:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
subsidized from the federal levels and
 
05:58:47.628 --> 05:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
through the RPS
 
05:58:50.910 --> 05:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
stuff and one of the big reasons there
 
05:58:54.030 --> 05:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
is to prevent the effects of climate
 
05:58:57.628 --> 05:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
change which is largely solely blamed on
 
05:58:57.638 --> 05:58:59.310 align:start position:0%
change which is largely solely blamed on
co2

05:58:59.310 --> 05:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
co2
 
05:59:01.390 --> 05:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
emissions climate change turns out to be
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
a lot more complicated than just that I
 
05:59:04.670 --> 05:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
won't go into details because we'll be
 
05:59:07.030 --> 05:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
here for the rest of the day
 
05:59:11.390 --> 05:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
um suffice it to say that the United
 
05:59:12.910 --> 05:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
States has done a pretty good job at
 
05:59:16.150 --> 05:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
reducing CO2 emissions in the last 10
 
05:59:18.350 --> 05:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
years or so largely thanks to our
 
05:59:21.110 --> 05:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
Reliance on natural gas which is good or
 
05:59:25.468 --> 05:59:25.478 align:start position:0%
bad um other countries especially India
 
05:59:28.628 --> 05:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
and China have seen their emissions
 
05:59:31.628 --> 05:59:31.638 align:start position:0%
increase by quite a bit China
 
05:59:34.510 --> 05:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
equaled the United States CO2 emissions
 
05:59:36.670 --> 05:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
in 2006
 
05:59:38.628 --> 05:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
they now emit something like almost two
 
05:59:42.590 --> 05:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
and a half times as much CO2 as we do so
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see our attempts at lowering CO2
 
05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
emissions is being terribly
 
05:59:52.510 --> 05:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
productive and given that the cost
 
05:59:56.910 --> 05:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
behind wind power is so high and even
 
05:59:58.708 --> 05:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
solar people are saying solar is getting
 
06:00:00.350 --> 06:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
cheap now but some of that comes from
 
06:00:02.948 --> 06:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
buying it from China
 
06:00:05.750 --> 06:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of that is still dependent
 
06:00:10.030 --> 06:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
on getting subsidies and my point for
 
06:00:12.468 --> 06:00:12.478 align:start position:0%
all of this and it ties ties into the
 
06:00:15.628 --> 06:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
Rex and the RPS systems here is i'
 
06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
really would like to see getting away
 
06:00:22.350 --> 06:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
from subsidies as much as we can um on
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:30.310 --> 06:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
disclosure I I also see that a diverse
 
06:00:32.990 --> 06:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
power supply is extremely important and
 
06:00:35.310 --> 06:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
ISO and like the previous speakers
 
06:00:35.320 --> 06:00:36.510 align:start position:0%
ISO and like the previous speakers
mentioned

06:00:36.510 --> 06:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
06:00:39.948 --> 06:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
understands that too and I've seen cases
 
06:00:41.830 --> 06:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
where our alliance on natural gas on
 
06:00:44.948 --> 06:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
some really cold days a couple years ago
 
06:00:46.868 --> 06:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
triggered increases in the spot Market
 
06:00:46.878 --> 06:00:47.590 align:start position:0%
triggered increases in the spot Market
to

06:00:47.590 --> 06:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
be several hundred dollars per megawatt
 
06:00:54.150 --> 06:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
hour so we need to get keep that under
 
06:00:57.190 --> 06:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
control too so ultimately I really have
 
06:01:00.788 --> 06:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
no good ideas on what I would recommend
 
06:01:02.350 --> 06:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire tries to
 
06:01:05.948 --> 06:01:05.958 align:start position:0%
do to maintain the sort of power
 
06:01:07.948 --> 06:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
distribution system that we
 
06:01:09.910 --> 06:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
need thank
 
06:01:12.750 --> 06:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh and also thank you for
 
06:01:15.350 --> 06:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
the written testimony that you
 
06:01:18.510 --> 06:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
submitted we appreciate that any
 
06:01:20.750 --> 06:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
06:01:22.948 --> 06:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
wormy yes Tom
 
06:01:26.590 --> 06:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
PL thank you chair and thank you for
 
06:01:29.150 --> 06:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned the
 
06:01:32.468 --> 06:01:32.478 align:start position:0%
productivity and standard of living well
 
06:01:34.510 --> 06:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
as you heard in testimony we have this
 
06:01:37.270 --> 06:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
big circle I'm going to use that analogy
 
06:01:39.510 --> 06:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
of growing the trees we have people out
 
06:01:41.190 --> 06:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
there that got Capital Investments that
 
06:01:45.110 --> 06:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
chip them transport them bass now we
 
06:01:48.468 --> 06:01:48.478 align:start position:0%
even use the ashes along with the
 
06:01:50.670 --> 06:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
historical we only have so many dams
 
06:01:52.150 --> 06:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're never going to replace them the
 
06:01:54.270 --> 06:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
hydro that gets
 
06:01:56.830 --> 06:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
wrecked you mentioned it would you
 
06:02:01.628 --> 06:02:01.638 align:start position:0%
cons label that as high on the standard
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
of living productivity for New Hampshire
 
06:02:07.430 --> 06:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
to keep those thank you um
 
06:02:10.948 --> 06:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
yeah for the most part yes um one thing
 
06:02:13.868 --> 06:02:13.878 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in my written testimony is
 
06:02:17.030 --> 06:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
that in the Gren wind project several
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
years ago when nire wind was trying to
 
06:02:22.190 --> 06:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
prevent more wind projects in the new
 
06:02:23.750 --> 06:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
found Lake
 
06:02:28.390 --> 06:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
Region I discovered that groten wind had
 
06:02:30.430 --> 06:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
something like four full-time employees
 
06:02:33.750 --> 06:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
to maintain their 24
 
06:02:37.868 --> 06:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
turbines and this wound up being each of
 
06:02:40.110 --> 06:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
these people was responsible for I
 
06:02:42.430 --> 06:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
believe about 12
 
06:02:44.628 --> 06:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
megaw of
 
06:02:47.868 --> 06:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
power if the wind was blowing that high
 
06:02:49.948 --> 06:02:49.958 align:start position:0%
enough to run the wind turbines at full
 
06:02:52.548 --> 06:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
power on the other hand I was quite
 
06:02:55.708 --> 06:02:55.718 align:start position:0%
astounded to discover that the Granite
 
06:02:58.510 --> 06:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
Ridge natural gas plant in
 
06:03:02.030 --> 06:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
londondary was running with I checked
 
06:03:04.150 --> 06:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
today they say about 30 people then I
 
06:03:06.590 --> 06:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
think it was 19
 
06:03:09.868 --> 06:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
and each person there is responsible for
 
06:03:12.788 --> 06:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
generating something like 23 megawatts
 
06:03:12.798 --> 06:03:13.910 align:start position:0%
generating something like 23 megawatts
of

06:03:13.910 --> 06:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:03:13.920 --> 06:03:15.910 align:start position:0%
of
power

06:03:15.910 --> 06:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
power
 
06:03:19.110 --> 06:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the key
 
06:03:21.590 --> 06:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
reasons now there are several reasons
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
but it's one of the reasons why I'm
 
06:03:27.510 --> 06:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
really not a fan of wind power at all um
 
06:03:29.910 --> 06:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
other generation schemes like
 
06:03:31.868 --> 06:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric I believe can run
 
06:03:35.190 --> 06:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
extremely efficiently um the
 
06:03:38.948 --> 06:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
infrastructure costs are High um but
 
06:03:40.788 --> 06:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
once set up and running that doesn't
 
06:03:43.510 --> 06:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
require too many people to keep things
 
06:03:46.070 --> 06:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
in operation uh one of the things you
 
06:03:48.468 --> 06:03:48.478 align:start position:0%
have not heard from when the wind power
 
06:03:51.830 --> 06:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
people is that the the blades wear out
 
06:03:54.868 --> 06:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
faster than the wind turbines in general
 
06:03:57.350 --> 06:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
themselves because they get impacted by
 
06:04:00.548 --> 06:04:00.558 align:start position:0%
insects and bats and other things and
 
06:04:05.070 --> 06:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
just dust so a lot of times um turbine
 
06:04:07.310 --> 06:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
blat need to be replaced well before
 
06:04:12.990 --> 06:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:15.230 --> 06:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
lifetime okay seeing no more questions I
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for making the trk
 
06:04:19.548 --> 06:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
down here from Sutton or Bradford or
 
06:04:22.230 --> 06:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
whatever thank you very much okay next
 
06:04:26.230 --> 06:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
we'll call on Dennis McKinny from
 
06:04:27.910 --> 06:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
barington New
 
06:04:31.830 --> 06:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
sorry should have put my glasses on
 
06:04:43.948 --> 06:04:43.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:45.830 --> 06:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you it's Bennington New Hampshire
 
06:04:48.070 --> 06:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
which is a wide spot in the road in
 
06:04:48.080 --> 06:04:49.230 align:start position:0%
which is a wide spot in the road in
Hillsboro

06:04:49.230 --> 06:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro
 
06:04:53.468 --> 06:04:53.478 align:start position:0%
County I am uh speaking in opposition to
 
06:04:54.510 --> 06:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:04:57.670 --> 06:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
219 my written testimony was submitted
 
06:05:00.270 --> 06:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
through your electronic portal late
 
06:05:02.990 --> 06:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday I'll be as brief as
 
06:05:05.910 --> 06:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
possible uh I am opposed because of I
 
06:05:08.230 --> 06:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
think believe strongly that we need
 
06:05:12.190 --> 06:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
public policy that Fosters wood as a
 
06:05:12.200 --> 06:05:14.948 align:start position:0%
public policy that Fosters wood as a
renewable

06:05:14.948 --> 06:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
renewable
 
06:05:18.910 --> 06:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
homegrown uh fuel source it's important
 
06:05:21.990 --> 06:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
for us to be as energy independent as
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
possible and more specifically I am a
 
06:05:28.230 --> 06:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
land owner of 100 acres of Timberland in
 
06:05:30.548 --> 06:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
Bennington and I've been a Consulting
 
06:05:34.230 --> 06:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
Forester I'm now in my 50th year uh I
 
06:05:37.430 --> 06:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
have used biomass as a a tool for the
 
06:05:40.510 --> 06:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
management of Timber projects Wildlife
 
06:05:44.590 --> 06:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
projects Recreation projects and uh to
 
06:05:47.548 --> 06:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
enhance water quality on Municipal
 
06:05:51.270 --> 06:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
watersheds it's a critical tool and it's
 
06:05:53.230 --> 06:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
deserving of stable
 
06:05:58.548 --> 06:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
markets thank you also on the issue of
 
06:06:01.590 --> 06:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
subsidies I would note that you can go
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
on the eversource page and there's an
 
06:06:07.788 --> 06:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
entire section devoted to rebates for
 
06:06:10.510 --> 06:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
heating and cooling uh and I have been
 
06:06:12.468 --> 06:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
the beneficiary of some of those
 
06:06:14.830 --> 06:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
subsidies when I have been smart enough
 
06:06:17.708 --> 06:06:17.718 align:start position:0%
to install heat pumps and cooling
 
06:06:21.190 --> 06:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
systems in my own home so thank you very
 
06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you seeing no questions
 
06:06:27.548 --> 06:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
we'll move next to Jennifer Smith from
 
06:06:27.558 --> 06:06:38.708 align:start position:0%
we'll move next to Jennifer Smith from
Pembroke

06:06:38.708 --> 06:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:41.548 --> 06:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
no Jennifer Smith from
 
06:06:41.558 --> 06:06:43.510 align:start position:0%
no Jennifer Smith from
Pembrook

06:06:43.510 --> 06:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
Pembrook
 
06:06:47.830 --> 06:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay next we'll go to Jim Van valkenberg
 
06:06:51.230 --> 06:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
from froling energy in
 
06:06:53.830 --> 06:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
Peterboro welcome back I think we saw
 
06:06:56.350 --> 06:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
you recently it's been a couple of years
 
06:06:59.070 --> 06:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
I think so thanks for having me uh
 
06:07:01.590 --> 06:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
froling energy is located in Peter
 
06:07:03.270 --> 06:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me it started in Peterborough but
 
06:07:06.310 --> 06:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
it actually uh is in Keen right now I'm
 
06:07:08.628 --> 06:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
from Peterboro myself I'm vice president
 
06:07:11.110 --> 06:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
of sales and marketing there and uh I've
 
06:07:12.590 --> 06:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
actually been involved in Renewables
 
06:07:14.948 --> 06:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
since 1978 in New Hampshire so it's been
 
06:07:17.628 --> 06:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
a long time and a long uh fight to try
 
06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
to get things established here and it's
 
06:07:22.150 --> 06:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
been a a long road that's been very very
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
rewarding um I just say this I'm here to
 
06:07:28.510 --> 06:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
support the biomass side of the RPS and
 
06:07:30.230 --> 06:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's where where froling energy is
 
06:07:33.110 --> 06:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
involved we happen to have a CHP system
 
06:07:35.190 --> 06:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
on our site where we're generating a
 
06:07:38.070 --> 06:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
heat for drying wood chips because we
 
06:07:40.750 --> 06:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
created this product called uh pdcs
 
06:07:42.830 --> 06:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
which is a dried wood chip fuel that is
 
06:07:46.030 --> 06:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
a very cost effective uh Fuel and mainly
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's because it reduces the cost of
 
06:07:51.310 --> 06:07:51.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in a boiler plant so we
 
06:07:54.670 --> 06:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
came up with this about 10 years ago we
 
06:07:56.830 --> 06:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
actually took it from Europe it's not a
 
06:07:59.830 --> 06:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
a new fuel but over in Europe over in
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
Europe it is a common Fuel and so we
 
06:08:04.110 --> 06:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
have many customers right now in New
 
06:08:06.230 --> 06:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and some in Vermont
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
that are using this Fuel and it's
 
06:08:10.948 --> 06:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
offsetting about a million gallons of
 
06:08:14.110 --> 06:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
fuel oil every year by our plant in Keen
 
06:08:16.708 --> 06:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
that utilizes wood chips that come from
 
06:08:18.590 --> 06:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
about a 50 mile radius most of those
 
06:08:21.468 --> 06:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and uh that is
 
06:08:24.430 --> 06:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
supporting this whole Marketplace uh
 
06:08:26.670 --> 06:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
these places include like wheel and
 
06:08:28.910 --> 06:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
Engineering which is offsetting about
 
06:08:31.708 --> 06:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
170,000 gallons of oil on that one site
 
06:08:35.110 --> 06:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
alone every year that's offset and what
 
06:08:36.868 --> 06:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
what access do they have to Fuels they
 
06:08:38.468 --> 06:08:38.478 align:start position:0%
have oil they have propane they have
 
06:08:40.270 --> 06:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
electricity they don't have anything
 
06:08:42.510 --> 06:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
else so we just like Charlie noted
 
06:08:44.910 --> 06:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
earlier we are in the area that is not
 
06:08:46.830 --> 06:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
served by natural gas and will probably
 
06:08:48.948 --> 06:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
never be served by natural gas just
 
06:08:51.110 --> 06:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
because of all the impediments of of
 
06:08:52.670 --> 06:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
putting new infrastructure as well as
 
06:08:55.868 --> 06:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
Supply but the the keys are that they
 
06:08:57.868 --> 06:08:57.878 align:start position:0%
found that this was the best alternative
 
06:08:59.468 --> 06:08:59.478 align:start position:0%
to oil that they could find it's
 
06:09:01.910 --> 06:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
actually very cost competitive to what
 
06:09:04.548 --> 06:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
if there was natural gas in that area
 
06:09:06.310 --> 06:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
these dry chips and then green chips are
 
06:09:08.070 --> 06:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
even less costly than that especially
 
06:09:10.708 --> 06:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
when you apply the uh the uh thermal
 
06:09:12.868 --> 06:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
wrecks that are part of the RPS so we're
 
06:09:15.670 --> 06:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
that little wedge of the RPS um we're
 
06:09:17.590 --> 06:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
also are heating a big Nursing Home in
 
06:09:19.510 --> 06:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
westerland a county supported nursing
 
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
home uh we we are the Department of
 
06:09:24.070 --> 06:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections in bosan we heat that whole
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
plant and uh you know these kinds of
 
06:09:29.070 --> 06:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
things are are just common in New
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not many other states are
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
doing this and this has been a big
 
06:09:34.310 --> 06:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
success story and there's so much more
 
06:09:35.788 --> 06:09:35.798 align:start position:0%
to do there's there's so many more
 
06:09:37.868 --> 06:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
businesses out there the the I think the
 
06:09:40.350 --> 06:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
rural areas the non-natural gas areas
 
06:09:42.830 --> 06:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
deserve to have a lowcost fuel and
 
06:09:45.548 --> 06:09:45.558 align:start position:0%
that's what the RPS does in two ways is
 
06:09:48.310 --> 06:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
it gives you a a chance to get a rebate
 
06:09:50.590 --> 06:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
or maybe a grant to put in this rather
 
06:09:52.190 --> 06:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
expensive system it's about double the
 
06:09:54.510 --> 06:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
cost of what a regular conventional oil
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
or gas system would cost and you end up
 
06:10:01.150 --> 06:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
with a a uh a better incentive to be
 
06:10:02.788 --> 06:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
able to do this by also running the
 
06:10:04.868 --> 06:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
calculations of what the thermal wrecks
 
06:10:07.310 --> 06:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
are going to give them over time so our
 
06:10:09.430 --> 06:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
fuel costs the equivalent of oil at
 
06:10:11.548 --> 06:10:11.558 align:start position:0%
about a dollar and a quarter a gallon
 
06:10:14.350 --> 06:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
currently so it's very inexpensive and
 
06:10:17.430 --> 06:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's a very high tech very low emissions
 
06:10:19.948 --> 06:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
very low maintenance there's lots of
 
06:10:21.750 --> 06:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
good things about it the technology has
 
06:10:23.628 --> 06:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
come forward and we've been able to
 
06:10:25.548 --> 06:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
advance this there's not many companies
 
06:10:27.310 --> 06:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
in this business we'd like to see that
 
06:10:29.788 --> 06:10:29.798 align:start position:0%
expand but at this point this is where
 
06:10:33.990 --> 06:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
we are at step by step so I just say uh
 
06:10:37.270 --> 06:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
let's let's uh not go forward with with
 
06:10:39.430 --> 06:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh abandoning the RPS we think it's
 
06:10:41.310 --> 06:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
doing great things and the fuel
 
06:10:43.310 --> 06:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
diversity in the state I think is very
 
06:10:43.320 --> 06:10:45.548 align:start position:0%
diversity in the state I think is very
very

06:10:45.548 --> 06:10:45.558 align:start position:0%
very
 
06:10:48.468 --> 06:10:48.478 align:start position:0%
important all right thank you for coming
 
06:10:50.548 --> 06:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
here and giving us your
 
06:10:53.030 --> 06:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Thomas I guess
 
06:10:56.788 --> 06:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
has a question yes I do um I'm intrigued
 
06:10:59.310 --> 06:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
about why you would dry chips is it that
 
06:11:01.548 --> 06:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
they burn better or is it they they
 
06:11:03.310 --> 06:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
weigh less and it there's less to
 
06:11:05.430 --> 06:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
transport them it's actually interesting
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
is it Greenwood chips come right out of
 
06:11:09.990 --> 06:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
the the the woods generally is that you
 
06:11:12.628 --> 06:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
have a a chipper in the woods he's sort
 
06:11:15.548 --> 06:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
some gentleman is sorting the the the
 
06:11:16.830 --> 06:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
logs and then putting them in the
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
chipper accordingly so he's paying
 
06:11:20.910 --> 06:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
attention to that but they come out as
 
06:11:23.310 --> 06:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
random size a lot of things could be as
 
06:11:25.110 --> 06:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
big as your fist some things are big as
 
06:11:26.830 --> 06:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
a matchbook and others could be as big
 
06:11:29.590 --> 06:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
as your arm and there's also uh metals
 
06:11:31.468 --> 06:11:31.478 align:start position:0%
and things that could come through that
 
06:11:34.468 --> 06:11:34.478 align:start position:0%
that that end up in a chip Supply so a
 
06:11:36.590 --> 06:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
wood chip plant plant like some of these
 
06:11:38.590 --> 06:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
that are in like miramac Valley High
 
06:11:40.910 --> 06:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
School they take in chips right out of
 
06:11:44.230 --> 06:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
the woods it's about 45% moisture and it
 
06:11:47.230 --> 06:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
falls off the tailgate of a truck into a
 
06:11:49.430 --> 06:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
pit and then from there it has to be all
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
these pushers and things under the pile
 
06:11:52.830 --> 06:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
have to they sort of move all these
 
06:11:54.670 --> 06:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
heavy chips around and finally get them
 
06:11:56.910 --> 06:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
to the boiler and the boiler has to S
 
06:11:59.510 --> 06:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
dry them within the boiler itself before
 
06:12:01.670 --> 06:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
they actually burn so that's a long long
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
process and it's going to be a big
 
06:12:05.750 --> 06:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
facility it's got to be bigger than a
 
06:12:08.030 --> 06:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
high school actually these days drywood
 
06:12:11.310 --> 06:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
chips we take the the same chips and we
 
06:12:12.868 --> 06:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
take they drop them off at our plant
 
06:12:15.070 --> 06:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
over in keen and then we put them
 
06:12:16.670 --> 06:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
through a screener that brings them down
 
06:12:19.110 --> 06:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
to a smaller size and then we dry them
 
06:12:21.468 --> 06:12:21.478 align:start position:0%
to 25% moisture and it gives us this one
 
06:12:22.910 --> 06:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
advantage that we're able to use a
 
06:12:25.788 --> 06:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
blower truck to put it up 30 feet in the
 
06:12:28.708 --> 06:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
air up into a silo and that's a simple
 
06:12:31.590 --> 06:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
agricultural silos so you end up with a
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
steel Silo that's very inexpensive above
 
06:12:37.110 --> 06:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
ground and when it's minus1 degrees
 
06:12:39.910 --> 06:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
outside Dry chips don't freeze together
 
06:12:43.430 --> 06:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
into a solid Mass so it's it's that 25%
 
06:12:45.230 --> 06:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
is just the perfect place for this fuel
 
06:12:47.750 --> 06:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be I find that fascinating thank you
 
06:12:51.468 --> 06:12:51.478 align:start position:0%
very much we do too representative
 
06:12:53.590 --> 06:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:12:55.190 --> 06:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
you Jim for being here yeah he does it
 
06:12:57.990 --> 06:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
Jim does a great job of explaining all
 
06:12:59.750 --> 06:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the technology involved but I just
 
06:13:02.590 --> 06:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
want to ask you you gave a few examples
 
06:13:05.150 --> 06:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
but could you give the committee a sense
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
sense of the the overall
 
06:13:10.990 --> 06:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
number uh in its in the lifetime of of
 
06:13:15.310 --> 06:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
the company rolling energy uh the number
 
06:13:18.628 --> 06:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
of municipalities and school districts
 
06:13:21.948 --> 06:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
and County facilities where you have
 
06:13:24.750 --> 06:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
installed biomass heating plants not
 
06:13:27.670 --> 06:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
just the Precision dry chips you
 
06:13:31.150 --> 06:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
described but also you know the the
 
06:13:34.110 --> 06:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
other kinds of boilers that you purchase
 
06:13:37.070 --> 06:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
um would pellet spoilers how many
 
06:13:38.948 --> 06:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
communities school districts County
 
06:13:41.468 --> 06:13:41.478 align:start position:0%
facilities throughout New Hampshire have
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
been installed by your company and when
 
06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
they did that they relied in part on the
 
06:13:50.990 --> 06:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
revenue stream that would come from the
 
06:13:53.628 --> 06:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
uh renewable energy certificates under
 
06:13:55.990 --> 06:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
the RPS there's a good number in fact
 
06:13:57.670 --> 06:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
that is our biggest Market is schools I
 
06:14:00.270 --> 06:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
didn't even mention the schools but even
 
06:14:02.030 --> 06:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
places like Plymouth State and and the
 
06:14:03.590 --> 06:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire have our
 
06:14:06.190 --> 06:14:06.200 align:start position:0%
systems on site uh we have school
 
06:14:10.468 --> 06:14:10.478 align:start position:0%
districts uh like in uh uh the the uh
 
06:14:13.070 --> 06:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
Belmont schools and the the Shaker
 
06:14:15.310 --> 06:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
District we we go up to Campton we're in
 
06:14:17.070 --> 06:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
Plymouth we're in you know there's
 
06:14:18.590 --> 06:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's about
 
06:14:22.110 --> 06:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
30 I'd say no maybe probably 2025
 
06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
districts in particular and many many
 
06:14:27.150 --> 06:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
schools as a result of that District um
 
06:14:28.750 --> 06:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
we often go in with the energy
 
06:14:31.030 --> 06:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
Performance Contractors and we act as
 
06:14:33.468 --> 06:14:33.478 align:start position:0%
the lowcost fuel that helps them to pay
 
06:14:35.468 --> 06:14:35.478 align:start position:0%
for these big energy renovations that
 
06:14:37.230 --> 06:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
are done in the school districts across
 
06:14:41.548 --> 06:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
the district so okay followup just again
 
06:14:43.708 --> 06:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
I was also asking about municipalities
 
06:14:46.708 --> 06:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
yep counties how many how many other
 
06:14:48.750 --> 06:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions have made these
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
Investments the towns um there's a a
 
06:14:53.468 --> 06:14:53.478 align:start position:0%
good few towns there's not a whole lot
 
06:14:55.110 --> 06:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
of towns it's more the counties you know
 
06:14:58.310 --> 06:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
like chesher County and and uh and
 
06:15:00.670 --> 06:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
Marram County I'd say the towns like
 
06:15:02.990 --> 06:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
Peterboro has like five installations in
 
06:15:05.190 --> 06:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
town and other towns have very small
 
06:15:07.390 --> 06:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
buildings we're out in the rural areas
 
06:15:08.670 --> 06:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
um you know but it's generally the
 
06:15:10.468 --> 06:15:10.478 align:start position:0%
schools that we're we're working with it
 
06:15:12.510 --> 06:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
seems the the municipalities we're like
 
06:15:15.350 --> 06:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
the henker uh um Wastewater not the
 
06:15:17.830 --> 06:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment but the DPW garage
 
06:15:19.628 --> 06:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
we we did as well as Hopkinson things
 
06:15:21.628 --> 06:15:21.638 align:start position:0%
like that are very minor but they you
 
06:15:23.910 --> 06:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
know they add up they add
 
06:15:23.920 --> 06:15:25.590 align:start position:0%
know they add up they add
up

06:15:25.590 --> 06:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:15:27.948 --> 06:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
good okay seeing no further questions
 
06:15:29.868 --> 06:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
we'll next call on Brook
 
06:15:33.230 --> 06:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
Peterson of Keane also from froling
 
06:15:33.240 --> 06:15:50.030 align:start position:0%
Peterson of Keane also from froling
energy

06:15:50.030 --> 06:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:52.390 --> 06:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
please confine your temp testimony to
 
06:15:55.788 --> 06:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
something different from what your your
 
06:15:59.070 --> 06:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
um companion there from Fring energy had
 
06:16:01.750 --> 06:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
to say I will um thank you for for
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
having me
 
06:16:06.350 --> 06:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair and um thank you
 
06:16:08.548 --> 06:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
house committee my name is Brooks
 
06:16:10.310 --> 06:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
Peterson I'm with froling energy and
 
06:16:11.590 --> 06:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
froling wood
 
06:16:11.600 --> 06:16:13.150 align:start position:0%
froling wood
boilers

06:16:13.150 --> 06:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
boilers
 
06:16:15.750 --> 06:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
and the letter that's being passed
 
06:16:17.548 --> 06:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
around was written by Mark froling and
 
06:16:20.310 --> 06:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm here on his behalf to testify
 
06:16:21.708 --> 06:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
for froling
 
06:16:24.070 --> 06:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
energy and we are strongly opposed to
 
06:16:25.788 --> 06:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:16:28.670 --> 06:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
219 Fring energy specializes in biomass
 
06:16:30.990 --> 06:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
heating systems and combined heat and
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
power projects and I can unequivocally
 
06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
state that these bills threaten not only
 
06:16:38.030 --> 06:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
the future of renewable energy in New
 
06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also the economic
 
06:16:42.310 --> 06:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
viability of local businesses job
 
06:16:44.110 --> 06:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
creation and New Hampshire State's
 
06:16:45.510 --> 06:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
leadership position as sustainable

06:16:50.030 --> 06:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
solutions while HB 219 proposes a
 
06:16:52.990 --> 06:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
gradual phase out of RPS over 5 years
 
06:16:55.350 --> 06:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
the reality is that impact will be Swift
 
06:16:55.360 --> 06:16:56.230 align:start position:0%
the reality is that impact will be Swift
and

06:16:56.230 --> 06:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:16:58.548 --> 06:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
devastating the mere anticipation of
 
06:17:01.030 --> 06:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
declining RPS requirements will cause
 
06:17:02.910 --> 06:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificate values to
 
06:17:05.910 --> 06:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
crash within the first year or two
 
06:17:07.788 --> 06:17:07.798 align:start position:0%
the rapid devaluation undermines the
 
06:17:09.230 --> 06:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
financial stability of existing
 
06:17:11.030 --> 06:17:11.040 align:start position:0%

Energy
 
06:17:16.910 --> 06:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
Technologies in addition there will be
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
economic impacts if this bill is passed
 
06:17:22.270 --> 06:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
such as job losses business uncertainty
 
06:17:23.788 --> 06:17:23.798 align:start position:0%
and higher long-term
 
06:17:25.990 --> 06:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
costs the renewable energy sector
 
06:17:28.030 --> 06:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
supports thousands of jobs in New
 
06:17:30.350 --> 06:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire phasing out the RPS will
 
06:17:33.190 --> 06:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
trigger job losses across the biomass

solar wind and other Ren rable
 
06:17:39.110 --> 06:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
Industries companies like ours rely on
 
06:17:40.990 --> 06:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
the RPS framework to secure financing
 
06:17:43.468 --> 06:17:43.478 align:start position:0%
for projects without a stable wreck
 
06:17:45.350 --> 06:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
Market investors will Retreat halting
 
06:17:48.548 --> 06:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
the growth of local renewable
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
businesses although the bill projects
 
06:17:52.788 --> 06:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
short-term reductions in electricity
 
06:17:55.030 --> 06:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
costs these savings are
 
06:17:57.868 --> 06:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
misleading over time Reliance on F
 
06:18:00.430 --> 06:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels will expose rate pairs to
 
06:18:02.510 --> 06:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
volatile Energy prices and undermine
 
06:18:06.708 --> 06:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:08.230 --> 06:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
furthermore there will be environmental
 
06:18:09.590 --> 06:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
impacts such as increased carbon
 
06:18:12.910 --> 06:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
emissions and energy insecurity the RPS
 
06:18:14.190 --> 06:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
has been instrumental in reducing
 
06:18:16.350 --> 06:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions eliminating it
 
06:18:18.110 --> 06:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
will reverse progress increasing our

undermining New Hampshire's climate
 
06:18:24.070 --> 06:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
goals a diminished renewable sector
 
06:18:26.030 --> 06:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
makes us more dependent on out-of-state
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
energy sources compromising our energy
 
06:18:31.468 --> 06:18:31.478 align:start position:0%
security I urge the committee to
 
06:18:32.990 --> 06:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
consider the broader implications of
 
06:18:39.190 --> 06:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:41.548 --> 06:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
219 okay thank you
 
06:18:44.750 --> 06:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Thomas thank

you um the the uh document that you sent
 
06:18:50.390 --> 06:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
out is also for HB 567 will you be
 
06:18:52.468 --> 06:18:52.478 align:start position:0%
testifying for that one as well I will

Sawmill uh we we have dry kils we have a
 
06:19:34.468 --> 06:19:34.478 align:start position:0%
planer Mill we have a pellet Mill as
 
06:19:34.478 --> 06:19:36.270 align:start position:0%
planer Mill we have a pellet Mill as
well

06:19:36.270 --> 06:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:19:39.510 --> 06:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
um let's see our our products are kill
 
06:19:42.670 --> 06:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
dried lumber wood pellets bag shavings
 
06:19:46.070 --> 06:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
bark mulch wood chips and sawdust uh
 
06:19:49.708 --> 06:19:49.718 align:start position:0%
each year we buy uh about 200 uh buy
 
06:19:53.390 --> 06:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
from 200 suppliers a year from the guy
 
06:19:56.270 --> 06:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
that delivers 10 loads of logs a week to
 
06:19:58.830 --> 06:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
the farmer that goes and cuts a load in
 
06:20:02.910 --> 06:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
the wintertime and helps pays his taxes
 
06:20:02.920 --> 06:20:04.868 align:start position:0%
the wintertime and helps pays his taxes
um

06:20:04.868 --> 06:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:08.670 --> 06:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh we we sell domestically and overseas
 
06:20:12.070 --> 06:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
our electric consumption is about uh
 
06:20:15.110 --> 06:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
10.5 million kilowatt hours a year and
 
06:20:18.350 --> 06:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
costs us about $1.2 million it's our
 
06:20:18.360 --> 06:20:19.350 align:start position:0%
costs us about $1.2 million it's our
highest

06:20:19.350 --> 06:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
highest
 
06:20:22.868 --> 06:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
cost um we are in the process of putting
 
06:20:26.628 --> 06:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
in a new 600 horsepower wood boil um and
 
06:20:28.390 --> 06:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
back pressure turbine to help offset
 
06:20:32.750 --> 06:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
some of those electric costs um and uh
 
06:20:36.708 --> 06:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
and to replace a a existing wood boiler
 
06:20:41.230 --> 06:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
that was put in when I was in diapers um
 
06:20:44.670 --> 06:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
which was about 47 years ago so it's
 
06:20:46.948 --> 06:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
time to replace that system with a
 
06:20:49.468 --> 06:20:49.478 align:start position:0%
cleaner more renewable or not more
 
06:20:52.948 --> 06:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
renewable but a cleaner system um and
 
06:20:55.430 --> 06:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
get some power out of it and be able to
 
06:20:57.670 --> 06:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
update our kils right now our kils are
 
06:21:00.468 --> 06:21:00.478 align:start position:0%
our bottleneck in our process we can't
 
06:21:02.910 --> 06:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
saw anymore because we can't dry
 
06:21:05.990 --> 06:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
anymore um
 
06:21:09.590 --> 06:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
let's see the new system is going to be
 
06:21:11.270 --> 06:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh a lot more efficient we're putting
 
06:21:15.830 --> 06:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
the the proper uh back tech uh um the
 
06:21:18.990 --> 06:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
technology to clean up the gas scream
 
06:21:21.548 --> 06:21:21.558 align:start position:0%
and part of that is due to wanting to
 
06:21:24.788 --> 06:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
qualify for the thermal Rex uh which has
 
06:21:28.230 --> 06:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
been built into US building this
 
06:21:28.240 --> 06:21:30.310 align:start position:0%
been built into US building this
project

06:21:30.310 --> 06:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
project
 
06:21:34.270 --> 06:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
um where am I you know uh one of the
 
06:21:36.110 --> 06:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
things this project will help us do is
 
06:21:38.390 --> 06:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
offset about 990,000 gallons of propane
 
06:21:41.190 --> 06:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
a year that we have to supplement right
 
06:21:43.070 --> 06:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
now we're burning some of our own
 
06:21:45.670 --> 06:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
biomass but we can't burn enough in the
 
06:21:48.150 --> 06:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
wintertime uh our our current boiler
 
06:21:50.230 --> 06:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
isn't big enough to supply all our needs
 
06:21:52.910 --> 06:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
during the cold so we have to supplement
 
06:21:55.548 --> 06:21:55.558 align:start position:0%
with natural gas and that's about 90,000
 
06:21:57.910 --> 06:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
gallons a year we'd really like to get
 
06:22:01.030 --> 06:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
off of that use our own byproducts and
 
06:22:03.150 --> 06:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
try to really become our own Island
 
06:22:03.160 --> 06:22:04.830 align:start position:0%
try to really become our own Island
there

06:22:04.830 --> 06:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:22:08.270 --> 06:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
um you know we think the uh the the RPS
 
06:22:13.110 --> 06:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
is is vital um to to our to this project
 
06:22:15.230 --> 06:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and and to the wood industry as a
 
06:22:18.910 --> 06:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
whole we're we are a big family uh when
 
06:22:21.150 --> 06:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
it comes to the power plants in the
 
06:22:23.628 --> 06:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
Sawmills we deal with the same
 
06:22:26.868 --> 06:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
loggers uh and all that money stays in
 
06:22:30.030 --> 06:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is one thing about
 
06:22:33.590 --> 06:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
this industry that is very unique is the
 
06:22:36.190 --> 06:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
guy the guy changing the tires and the
 
06:22:39.230 --> 06:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
log truck is sending his kid to the same
 
06:22:41.628 --> 06:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
high school that you know the Sawmill
 
06:22:43.590 --> 06:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
owner of the power plant owner the guy
 
06:22:46.070 --> 06:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's running the power plant it's all
 
06:22:47.390 --> 06:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
together here in New Hampshire and that
 
06:22:50.510 --> 06:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
money stays in New Hampshire okay final
 
06:22:53.708 --> 06:22:53.718 align:start position:0%
thought please final thought uh I I
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
would urge you to vote no on House Bill
 
06:22:59.200 --> 06:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
would urge you to vote no on House Bill
uh

06:23:00.070 --> 06:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:23:05.190 --> 06:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
219 and that my final thought
 
06:23:07.510 --> 06:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Swanson has a
 
06:23:10.990 --> 06:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chair uh
 
06:23:12.750 --> 06:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and providing
 
06:23:16.390 --> 06:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
the testimony uh Mr car uh how much
 
06:23:19.788 --> 06:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
would you say that the you you mentioned
 
06:23:22.390 --> 06:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
getting uh wood from various Timber
 
06:23:26.190 --> 06:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
suppliers correct yes and uh so how much
 
06:23:28.628 --> 06:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
does that fluctuate on an annual basis
 
06:23:33.070 --> 06:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
or is it uh the market value or cost a
 
06:23:36.270 --> 06:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
month-by-month change
 
06:23:38.708 --> 06:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
mean from the the amount of suppliers we
 
06:23:40.990 --> 06:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
get from right the cost I mean you pay
 
06:23:42.910 --> 06:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
for like the board foot or something
 
06:23:46.070 --> 06:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
like that how oh how much so the the one
 
06:23:46.080 --> 06:23:47.590 align:start position:0%
like that how oh how much so the the one
thing

06:23:47.590 --> 06:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:23:51.070 --> 06:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the pine industry we we ride a
 
06:23:54.110 --> 06:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
wave that's like this whereas
 
06:23:57.750 --> 06:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
dimensional number 2x4s your 2x 12s your
 
06:24:00.548 --> 06:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
structural Timber they they ride a wave
 
06:24:03.708 --> 06:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
like this and so one thing that you can
 
06:24:06.510 --> 06:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
almost set your watch by the price of
 
06:24:10.110 --> 06:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
pine uh it might fluctuate by you know
 
06:24:12.910 --> 06:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
some dollars but it stays right here
 
06:24:14.468 --> 06:24:14.478 align:start position:0%
where you get into the hardwood markets
 
06:24:15.948 --> 06:24:15.958 align:start position:0%
you get in the softwood markets and it's
 
06:24:18.510 --> 06:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
a little more volatile can you following
 
06:24:20.510 --> 06:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair follow up can you take
 
06:24:24.310 --> 06:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:26.590 --> 06:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
change I guess I'm not understanding the
 
06:24:30.270 --> 06:24:30.280 align:start position:0%
question like it goes up or down 5% 10%
 
06:24:33.150 --> 06:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
oh it probably probably our our wood
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
cost varies
 
06:24:39.190 --> 06:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know two to 5% okay thank you thank
 
06:24:40.788 --> 06:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
06:24:43.750 --> 06:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
chair okay seeing no further questions
 
06:24:47.350 --> 06:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
we'll move next to John Moses from Bath
 
06:24:48.750 --> 06:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:24:54.590 --> 06:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:57.150 --> 06:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
Lumber representative Swanson turn off
 
06:25:00.190 --> 06:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
your mic when you're not speaking thank
 
06:25:03.548 --> 06:25:03.558 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon my name is John Moses
 
06:25:05.830 --> 06:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
I'm from east in New Hampshire and my
 
06:25:07.990 --> 06:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
family owns and operates Britain Lumber
 
06:25:10.628 --> 06:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
Company in Bath New Hampshire uh thank
 
06:25:13.070 --> 06:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
you for having me and um the opportunity
 
06:25:13.080 --> 06:25:13.910 align:start position:0%
you for having me and um the opportunity
to

06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:25:16.070 --> 06:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
testify uh we've been a family-owned
 
06:25:19.070 --> 06:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
business since 1946 I manage our
 
06:25:21.788 --> 06:25:21.798 align:start position:0%
manufacturing plant in Bath New
 
06:25:24.948 --> 06:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh our family just invested $7
 
06:25:27.468 --> 06:25:27.478 align:start position:0%
million into a combined heat and power
 
06:25:30.190 --> 06:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
plant which is also going to heat our
 
06:25:32.548 --> 06:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
sawl um among other things we're not
 
06:25:35.390 --> 06:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
some huge corporation it's my brother
 
06:25:37.150 --> 06:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
dad and I trying to do what we think is
 
06:25:39.510 --> 06:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
right and make smart Investments so
 
06:25:41.430 --> 06:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
obviously comes down to economics and
 
06:25:44.390 --> 06:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
having stable State policy part of the
 
06:25:46.030 --> 06:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
economics for this investment was
 
06:25:48.190 --> 06:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
because of our ability to generate
 
06:25:50.430 --> 06:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
thermal wrecks if we had known that
 
06:25:51.830 --> 06:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
these were going to be taken away from
 
06:25:54.070 --> 06:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
us right after we made the investment we
 
06:25:55.590 --> 06:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
still probably would have replaced our
 
06:25:58.510 --> 06:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
45-year-old Woodfired boiler um
 
06:25:59.910 --> 06:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
installed the back pressure steam
 
06:26:01.990 --> 06:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
turbine but we may not have been able to
 
06:26:05.510 --> 06:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
do the Sawmill heating or fuel layers um
 
06:26:08.030 --> 06:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
and some other aspects of the project
 
06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
that we relying on these um thermal
 
06:26:12.868 --> 06:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
wrecks to kind of help us with our
 
06:26:13.830 --> 06:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
return on
 
06:26:15.788 --> 06:26:15.798 align:start position:0%
investment uh these are all good
 
06:26:17.510 --> 06:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
projects for the state and especially
 
06:26:19.070 --> 06:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
the North country as they create and
 
06:26:21.628 --> 06:26:21.638 align:start position:0%
retain jobs all while creating much
 
06:26:23.628 --> 06:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
needed diversification in our energy
 
06:26:26.628 --> 06:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
Supply it's also very sustainable to use
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
local a local renewable resource to
 
06:26:32.390 --> 06:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
manufacture Lumber and use that sawas
 
06:26:35.708 --> 06:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
byproduct to generate electricity
 
06:26:39.230 --> 06:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
we employ 35 to 40 people in bath our
 
06:26:41.910 --> 06:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
annual payroll exceeds $2 million and we
 
06:26:45.708 --> 06:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
support 250 plus loggers and Foresters
 
06:26:48.070 --> 06:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
that circulate over $4 million into the
 
06:26:50.868 --> 06:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
local economy um another thing I'd like
 
06:26:52.750 --> 06:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
to point out is that we received a New
 
06:26:55.230 --> 06:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy grant for
 
06:26:57.310 --> 06:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
our project because of its ability to
 
06:26:59.910 --> 06:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
generate reck which is part of what this
 
06:27:03.150 --> 06:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
RPS bill is all about so we kind of
 
06:27:06.390 --> 06:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
looked at um the return on investment
 
06:27:08.948 --> 06:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
and the um money that was out there
 
06:27:10.430 --> 06:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
through these programs that kind of
 
06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
helped us make decisions on how big of a
 
06:27:14.830 --> 06:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
scale of a project we were going to be
 
06:27:18.150 --> 06:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
able to afford to do um which again is
 
06:27:19.628 --> 06:27:19.638 align:start position:0%
putting money back into the local
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
economy supporting um the loggers and
 
06:27:25.628 --> 06:27:25.638 align:start position:0%
the good people that we employ and work
 
06:27:28.510 --> 06:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
with um the other thing
 
06:27:31.150 --> 06:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
that I guess I mean this has been said
 
06:27:33.670 --> 06:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
but if this gets taken away this will
 
06:27:33.680 --> 06:27:34.670 align:start position:0%
but if this gets taken away this will
affect

06:27:34.670 --> 06:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
affect
 
06:27:37.150 --> 06:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
um the logging capacity if we don't have
 
06:27:39.230 --> 06:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
good markets for our
 
06:27:43.270 --> 06:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
byproducts um and yeah kind of hurts the
 
06:27:46.390 --> 06:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
people that we employ and work
 
06:27:48.548 --> 06:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
with now again I urge you all to
 
06:27:50.390 --> 06:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
reconsider this bill and I would like to
 
06:27:51.910 --> 06:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
invite every one of you up to the mill
 
06:27:53.990 --> 06:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
to continue the conversation we had
 
06:27:56.310 --> 06:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
Kelly aot and Dave Rosher up at the Mill
 
06:27:58.670 --> 06:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
for a sawmill this past summer and they
 
06:28:00.390 --> 06:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
both support what we are doing it would
 
06:28:01.830 --> 06:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
be nice to have the support from the
 
06:28:07.510 --> 06:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:09.910 --> 06:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
you okay thank
 
06:28:12.670 --> 06:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
you seeing no questions we'll move next
 
06:28:15.270 --> 06:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
to John O'Neal from the city of
 
06:28:21.070 --> 06:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:26.670 --> 06:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:29.310 --> 06:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh Mr chairman committee

Manchester Waterworks to oppose House
 
06:28:48.708 --> 06:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
Bill uh
 
06:28:51.110 --> 06:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
219 uh Manchester Waterworks owns and

supply uh we own this property to ensure
 
06:29:04.110 --> 06:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
the protection of water quality at Lake
 
06:29:06.910 --> 06:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
as Bic uh the primary source for our
 
06:29:10.230 --> 06:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
communities served our utility franchise
 
06:29:13.190 --> 06:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
supplies water to 13 cities and towns
 
06:29:14.948 --> 06:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
including Manchester and all of our
 
06:29:18.628 --> 06:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
abing communities and we um do uh ship
 
06:29:20.430 --> 06:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
water all the way down to plasto and
 
06:29:24.708 --> 06:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
Salem uh in all approximately 150 uh to
 
06:29:27.910 --> 06:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
160,000 New Hampshire residents um or
 
06:29:30.708 --> 06:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
businesses use our water uh the health
 
06:29:32.070 --> 06:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
of our forest around the public water
 
06:29:34.708 --> 06:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
supply uh Reservoir is crucial crucial
 
06:29:36.548 --> 06:29:36.558 align:start position:0%
and critical to help maintaining optimal
 
06:29:39.230 --> 06:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
water quality biomass harvesting is
 
06:29:41.548 --> 06:29:41.558 align:start position:0%
considered a vital tool to best manage
 
06:29:44.548 --> 06:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
our forest a healthy chip Market allows
 
06:29:47.150 --> 06:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
us us as resource managers to optimize
 
06:29:49.230 --> 06:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
best forestry and health by removing
 
06:29:51.708 --> 06:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
dead and unhealthy trees as well as Tree
 
06:29:54.190 --> 06:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
Tops and slash to minimize the amount of
 
06:29:56.110 --> 06:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
Slash and debris Left Behind after a
 
06:29:59.390 --> 06:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:01.708 --> 06:30:01.718 align:start position:0%
operation uh the absence of a chip
 
06:30:04.510 --> 06:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
Market uh this material will be left to
 
06:30:06.350 --> 06:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
decompose in the woods and would
 
06:30:08.670 --> 06:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
therefore increase fire danger as well
 
06:30:11.628 --> 06:30:11.638 align:start position:0%
as uh nutrient loading into our our our
 
06:30:14.030 --> 06:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
surface water supply uh which could
 
06:30:17.110 --> 06:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
introduce uh toxic algae into the lake
 
06:30:19.708 --> 06:30:19.718 align:start position:0%
um by nutrient loading um for the reason
 
06:30:21.430 --> 06:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
stated above Manchester Waterworks
 
06:30:24.310 --> 06:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
opposes both House Bill two uh or
 
06:30:25.948 --> 06:30:25.958 align:start position:0%
opposes House Bill
 
06:30:28.430 --> 06:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
219 um thank you for the opportunity to
 
06:30:31.670 --> 06:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
speak today um to summarize you know you
 
06:30:33.390 --> 06:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
know what I'm here to bring is that this
 
06:30:35.990 --> 06:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
is a really good tool for us to we we
 
06:30:38.070 --> 06:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
remove a lot of the low-grade material
 
06:30:40.310 --> 06:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
and keep the healthy stock in our forest
 
06:30:43.468 --> 06:30:43.478 align:start position:0%
and makes it resilient against um all
 
06:30:46.628 --> 06:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh you know storm events and
 
06:30:49.030 --> 06:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
other things that could impact our water
 
06:30:51.110 --> 06:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
quality so it's really about managing
 
06:30:53.670 --> 06:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
our buffer and without a b healthy
 
06:30:56.030 --> 06:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
biomass Market it it would make it very
 
06:30:58.270 --> 06:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to impossible to maintain the
 
06:31:01.868 --> 06:31:01.878 align:start position:0%
level of of uh of Forest Health that
 
06:31:02.948 --> 06:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
we've been able to maintain in
 
06:31:02.958 --> 06:31:06.110 align:start position:0%
we've been able to maintain in
Manchester

06:31:06.110 --> 06:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:07.868 --> 06:31:07.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
06:31:10.030 --> 06:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
testimony Vice chair Thomas has a
 
06:31:11.750 --> 06:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chairman
 
06:31:13.190 --> 06:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh just
 
06:31:16.110 --> 06:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
for my own uh understanding
 
06:31:19.468 --> 06:31:19.478 align:start position:0%
so the Waterworks company does not
 
06:31:22.590 --> 06:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
receive reck from the old wood it's the
 
06:31:25.708 --> 06:31:25.718 align:start position:0%
fact that you can you can sell the wood
 
06:31:28.670 --> 06:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
to companies that do have use for it and
 
06:31:30.948 --> 06:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
therefore they get paid re for it is
 
06:31:33.350 --> 06:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
that correct yes it's yes it's it's a
 
06:31:36.350 --> 06:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
keeping ath Marketplace for the chips
 
06:31:38.590 --> 06:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
that is a big part of what we what we
 
06:31:40.788 --> 06:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
Harvest off our Timberlands I'm part of
 
06:31:42.910 --> 06:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
a a larger group uh community group of
 
06:31:44.670 --> 06:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
all the large water supplies throughout
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
the Northeast and when I go down to New
 
06:31:49.270 --> 06:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
Jersey Massachusetts and other places
 
06:31:51.230 --> 06:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
where they don't have chip markets they
 
06:31:52.628 --> 06:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
often have a lot of forest health
 
06:31:54.070 --> 06:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
problems that we don't have and they
 
06:31:55.830 --> 06:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of water quality problems uh
 
06:31:58.708 --> 06:31:58.718 align:start position:0%
in their watersheds but uh because New
 
06:32:00.430 --> 06:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has invested in the low
 
06:32:03.030 --> 06:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
quality uh in the the lower quality
 
06:32:05.510 --> 06:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
Market place it has allowed us to really
 
06:32:08.788 --> 06:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
have a um top-notch um Force Management
 
06:32:11.150 --> 06:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
program which really translates to
 
06:32:14.628 --> 06:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:18.270 --> 06:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
water representative rols has a question
 
06:32:19.990 --> 06:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:32:22.230 --> 06:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
being here um you're in your testimony
 
06:32:25.350 --> 06:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned um between Manchester
 
06:32:27.270 --> 06:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
obviously and surrounding towns that you
 
06:32:30.350 --> 06:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
supply water to
 
06:32:35.150 --> 06:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
160,000 uh customers or households uh
 
06:32:38.910 --> 06:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
um you must be part of a Association
 
06:32:41.868 --> 06:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
there must be other Metropolitan um or
 
06:32:44.230 --> 06:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know other cities in and towns in
 
06:32:44.240 --> 06:32:46.388 align:start position:0%
you know other cities in and towns in
the

06:32:46.388 --> 06:32:46.398 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:32:49.548 --> 06:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
state do you uh is it your understanding
 
06:32:53.750 --> 06:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
that you know other municipalities other
 
06:32:55.788 --> 06:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
towns in the state have
 
06:32:58.788 --> 06:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
similar uh Reliance or at least that
 
06:33:01.070 --> 06:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
they the chip Market the healthy chip
 
06:33:03.310 --> 06:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
Market helps all these other towns in
 
06:33:06.310 --> 06:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
the state manage their watersheds I know
 
06:33:08.590 --> 06:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth we depend on the Bellamy
 
06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
Reservoir and and Durham is it is it the
 
06:33:14.350 --> 06:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
same story across the state so many of
 
06:33:16.468 --> 06:33:16.478 align:start position:0%
our municipalities are relying on this
 
06:33:18.910 --> 06:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
vibrant ship Market um any M
 
06:33:21.590 --> 06:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
municipality that has a forested
 
06:33:24.350 --> 06:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
watershed uh would utilize the biomass
 
06:33:27.430 --> 06:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
markets in order for to perform uh best
 
06:33:30.270 --> 06:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
Forest practices so I know the city of
 
06:33:32.708 --> 06:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
Keane has a large Watershed that they um
 
06:33:34.990 --> 06:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
they have U managed and I would assume
 
06:33:36.670 --> 06:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
that they are in the same boat we are
 
06:33:38.910 --> 06:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
where um you know we're not high grading
 
06:33:40.590 --> 06:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
we're not um we're not cutting for
 
06:33:42.670 --> 06:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
profit we're cutting for water quality
 
06:33:45.468 --> 06:33:45.478 align:start position:0%
so it does help uh it offsets our costs
 
06:33:47.788 --> 06:33:47.798 align:start position:0%
and actually makes it feasible for us to
 
06:33:50.150 --> 06:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
actually perform the Harvest um so there
 
06:33:51.868 --> 06:33:51.878 align:start position:0%
are the White Mountain National Forest
 
06:33:54.110 --> 06:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
is a huge Watershed for the upper marac
 
06:33:55.868 --> 06:33:55.878 align:start position:0%
river and the and the Connecticut River
 
06:33:58.310 --> 06:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
so even the operations that happen on
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
Forest Service lands is all about
 
06:34:01.948 --> 06:34:01.958 align:start position:0%
watershed management as well so it kind
 
06:34:05.788 --> 06:34:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:08.230 --> 06:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman we've heard
 
06:34:12.388 --> 06:34:12.398 align:start position:0%
that from the sponsor of the bill um you
 
06:34:15.150 --> 06:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
know to do away with the
 
06:34:18.430 --> 06:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
RPS and it's very easy to calculate when
 
06:34:20.388 --> 06:34:20.398 align:start position:0%
you take compliance costs of
 
06:34:23.110 --> 06:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
RPS and divided by rate payer you know
 
06:34:25.388 --> 06:34:25.398 align:start position:0%
that it the benefit of doing so would
 
06:34:29.150 --> 06:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
purportedly be $1.98 per household per
 
06:34:32.230 --> 06:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
month do you think that the value of the
 
06:34:34.948 --> 06:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
Watershed uh Management Services that
 
06:34:38.310 --> 06:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
are supported by the U the RPS are worth
 
06:34:42.310 --> 06:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
$1.98 per month to the households of New
 
06:34:44.190 --> 06:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well I think how it would
 
06:34:46.030 --> 06:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
translate for us to households in New
 
06:34:48.468 --> 06:34:48.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that um the customers that
 
06:34:51.708 --> 06:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
drink our water rely on um you know
 
06:34:53.670 --> 06:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
having a pristine having a pristine
 
06:34:55.788 --> 06:34:55.798 align:start position:0%
source and we do treat the water we
 
06:34:58.350 --> 06:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
filter um we filter the water that we do
 
06:35:00.750 --> 06:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
get but we uh the the water quality as
 
06:35:02.510 --> 06:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
it comes in before it's filtered is is
 
06:35:04.548 --> 06:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
very high quality but yet still requires
 
06:35:08.310 --> 06:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
treatment um if we were not um if we
 
06:35:09.708 --> 06:35:09.718 align:start position:0%
weren't managing the buffer the way we
 
06:35:11.788 --> 06:35:11.798 align:start position:0%
are now it could increase you know
 
06:35:13.310 --> 06:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
treatment costs which would increase
 
06:35:15.230 --> 06:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
cost to the customer on the other end so
 
06:35:17.468 --> 06:35:17.478 align:start position:0%
there could be that you that
 
06:35:20.548 --> 06:35:20.558 align:start position:0%
circumstance if we uh see a diminishment
 
06:35:22.548 --> 06:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
of our water quality where our treatment
 
06:35:26.030 --> 06:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
costs would go up thank
 
06:35:29.190 --> 06:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee thank you Mr
 
06:35:30.788 --> 06:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:35:33.788 --> 06:35:33.798 align:start position:0%
question the last couple of testifiers
 
06:35:36.750 --> 06:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
um have all mentioned their little piece
 
06:35:39.150 --> 06:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
of the pie in terms of how you know
 
06:35:41.230 --> 06:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
Yankee Ingenuity Works in New Hampshire
 
06:35:44.430 --> 06:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
where we we've solved multiple problems
 
06:35:47.670 --> 06:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
um and are doing more than just the one
 
06:35:49.070 --> 06:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
thing right that's what you're saying
 
06:35:52.030 --> 06:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying a a byproduct of the way
 
06:35:53.788 --> 06:35:53.798 align:start position:0%
you operate your business is providing
 
06:35:59.510 --> 06:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
this other benefit so um so what would
 
06:36:04.628 --> 06:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:07.910 --> 06:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh well I guess the word I want to use
 
06:36:10.468 --> 06:36:10.478 align:start position:0%
is tenuous but I get the sense that
 
06:36:13.788 --> 06:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
we're sort of uh that a lot of small
 
06:36:16.910 --> 06:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
businesses are holding up basically um
 
06:36:19.548 --> 06:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
the energy economy and also uh many
 
06:36:21.948 --> 06:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
other aspects of the environmental
 
06:36:24.750 --> 06:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
economy um can you speak to that at all
 
06:36:27.110 --> 06:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
because I you did allude to it just very
 
06:36:29.590 --> 06:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
specifically about how you're operating
 
06:36:32.310 --> 06:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
but if you go away tomorrow right if if
 
06:36:35.830 --> 06:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
we end up doing something that that puts
 
06:36:38.270 --> 06:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh small businesses like Mr Moses's
 
06:36:40.230 --> 06:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
family business that's been with us
 
06:36:40.240 --> 06:36:40.990 align:start position:0%
family business that's been with us
since

06:36:40.990 --> 06:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
since
 
06:36:43.590 --> 06:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
1946 if we make it harder for those
 
06:36:45.708 --> 06:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
businesses to function what do you think
 
06:36:47.430 --> 06:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the impacts are and I think I
 
06:36:48.990 --> 06:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
think representative reyolds was trying
 
06:36:50.788 --> 06:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
to get at that too with his
 
06:36:53.430 --> 06:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
question to the state if we lose if we
 
06:36:55.628 --> 06:36:55.638 align:start position:0%
lose the small Marketplace out there for
 
06:36:59.110 --> 06:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
Sawmills and and other and other
 
06:37:01.030 --> 06:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
production in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:37:02.510 --> 06:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
I mean I think it it would you know you
 
06:37:04.430 --> 06:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
have small land owners owners that uh
 
06:37:06.230 --> 06:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
manage their properties and and get
 
06:37:08.350 --> 06:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
income to help pay their taxes um by
 
06:37:10.388 --> 06:37:10.398 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting so that would that
 
06:37:12.628 --> 06:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
would um you know that could impact them
 
06:37:15.070 --> 06:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
if there isn't uh loggers and and
 
06:37:18.830 --> 06:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
Sawmills to you know to come and uh buy
 
06:37:20.350 --> 06:37:20.360 align:start position:0%
their product so that's that's one
 
06:37:22.190 --> 06:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
impact I would think of that if you if
 
06:37:25.070 --> 06:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
you lose I mean I've seen it i' i' I've
 
06:37:27.708 --> 06:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
been in contact with uh you know other
 
06:37:29.868 --> 06:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
uh water companies and uh forestry
 
06:37:32.990 --> 06:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
people south of us Massachusetts New
 
06:37:36.510 --> 06:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
York um Connecticut Rhode Island I mean
 
06:37:38.430 --> 06:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
there's some big owners down there and
 
06:37:40.190 --> 06:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
and they have to ship all their Wood
 
06:37:42.110 --> 06:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
Products out of state uh to get
 
06:37:44.548 --> 06:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
manufactured and therefore it's a it's a
 
06:37:46.548 --> 06:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
much less bottom dollar for the property
 
06:37:48.468 --> 06:37:48.478 align:start position:0%
owner so whether it's a private property
 
06:37:51.548 --> 06:37:51.558 align:start position:0%
owner or a water supply or someone else
 
06:37:53.628 --> 06:37:53.638 align:start position:0%
um you know and then it sometimes just
 
06:37:55.110 --> 06:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it economically feasible
 
06:37:56.670 --> 06:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
for them to do the work and therefore
 
06:37:58.270 --> 06:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
then the forest suffers because it's not
 
06:38:00.708 --> 06:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
being actively managed for health so
 
06:38:02.910 --> 06:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
it's I think if you if these markets
 
06:38:04.670 --> 06:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
start to go way which we've lost markets
 
06:38:06.510 --> 06:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um you know it has been
 
06:38:08.310 --> 06:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
a tough go and I don't think we really
 
06:38:10.510 --> 06:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
can afford to lose more of them because
 
06:38:12.430 --> 06:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
you know I think you know it's a healthy
 
06:38:14.110 --> 06:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
Marketplace you know to keep a healthy
 
06:38:16.230 --> 06:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
Marketplace out there is important uh
 
06:38:18.310 --> 06:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
one other little sidebar um you know we
 
06:38:21.310 --> 06:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
are 8,000 Acres 7500 is open to the
 
06:38:22.628 --> 06:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
public to come recreate and we have
 
06:38:24.110 --> 06:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
people come from all around the state to
 
06:38:27.110 --> 06:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
mountain bike hike hunt um we have over
 
06:38:29.830 --> 06:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
400 Hunters that hunt on our property
 
06:38:32.788 --> 06:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
and um you know the uh the Aesthetics of
 
06:38:34.388 --> 06:38:34.398 align:start position:0%
actually biom Mass chipping when we they
 
06:38:35.750 --> 06:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
chip the tops instead of leaving the
 
06:38:37.430 --> 06:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
slash behind I mean it's we have a
 
06:38:39.070 --> 06:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
beautiful property that you know come on
 
06:38:40.788 --> 06:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
down to Manchester and go for a hike
 
06:38:42.750 --> 06:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
take your dog for a walk uh it's very
 
06:38:44.430 --> 06:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
accessible to the you know it's not
 
06:38:45.868 --> 06:38:45.878 align:start position:0%
really just the city of Manchester it's
 
06:38:48.150 --> 06:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
really all of Central and Southern New
 
06:38:49.868 --> 06:38:49.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire come visit us so and Lake
 
06:38:51.270 --> 06:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
Massabesic as well you can go out
 
06:38:53.708 --> 06:38:53.718 align:start position:0%
boating on the lake and it's uh and that
 
06:38:55.670 --> 06:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
we we can do the best forestry with
 
06:38:59.628 --> 06:38:59.638 align:start position:0%
biomass harvesting is is my
 
06:39:02.868 --> 06:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
point okay thank you seeing no further
 
06:39:07.468 --> 06:39:07.478 align:start position:0%
questions next call on thank you uh Bob
 
06:39:12.388 --> 06:39:12.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:14.548 --> 06:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
forestry I can't quite make out your
 
06:39:32.070 --> 06:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:36.270 --> 06:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
so uh good afternoon uh Mr chairman and
 
06:39:39.230 --> 06:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
committee members I'm here today opposed
 
06:39:43.110 --> 06:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
to the bill I'm my name is Robert birdie
 
06:39:45.350 --> 06:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
bti I'm from

Forester I have number three number I'm
 
06:39:56.110 --> 06:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
a forest land
 
06:39:58.750 --> 06:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
owner I'm a selectman in the town of
 
06:40:01.788 --> 06:40:01.798 align:start position:0%

chair and I have have uh actively owned
 
06:40:07.590 --> 06:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
and managed Forest land uh in New
 
06:40:12.190 --> 06:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for over 60 years now um some
 
06:40:14.110 --> 06:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
of my ownership will be passing to my
 
06:40:17.310 --> 06:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
grandson and I hope he has the benefit
 
06:40:20.150 --> 06:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
of having the land as I have had for
 
06:40:23.708 --> 06:40:23.718 align:start position:0%
number of years um although not included
 
06:40:26.310 --> 06:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
in my testimony I would like to point
 
06:40:30.388 --> 06:40:30.398 align:start position:0%
out that my property has been open to
 
06:40:33.868 --> 06:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
the public for since I've owned it
 
06:40:36.468 --> 06:40:36.478 align:start position:0%
I allow fishing and
 
06:40:36.478 --> 06:40:38.788 align:start position:0%
I allow fishing and
hunting

06:40:38.788 --> 06:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
06:40:42.510 --> 06:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:46.270 --> 06:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
skiing uh bird watching and even have
 
06:40:48.868 --> 06:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
allowed people to uh pick fiddlehead
 
06:40:50.190 --> 06:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
ferns on the
 
06:40:52.388 --> 06:40:52.398 align:start position:0%
property uh for
 
06:40:56.150 --> 06:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
this benefit to the public I have
 
06:40:59.150 --> 06:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
received no subsidies and no government
 
06:41:02.230 --> 06:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
handouts my land is open free to be used
 
06:41:05.868 --> 06:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:08.910 --> 06:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
the importance of the low-grade Market
 
06:41:11.070 --> 06:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
in managing
 
06:41:13.468 --> 06:41:13.478 align:start position:0%
Timberland is critical for long-term
 
06:41:13.478 --> 06:41:14.388 align:start position:0%
Timberland is critical for long-term
Forest

06:41:14.388 --> 06:41:14.398 align:start position:0%
Forest
 
06:41:16.510 --> 06:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
management because without markets you
 
06:41:18.270 --> 06:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
really can't manage your
 
06:41:21.708 --> 06:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
land New Hampshire is very fortunate
 
06:41:24.548 --> 06:41:24.558 align:start position:0%
that we have markets now for all the
 
06:41:27.468 --> 06:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
products that are grown on our
 
06:41:31.110 --> 06:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
forest since the mid 1980s the Bas
 
06:41:33.230 --> 06:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
Market has provided an important
 
06:41:36.910 --> 06:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
important outlet for load grade V value
 
06:41:38.948 --> 06:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
fiber in New
 
06:41:42.628 --> 06:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the quality of our forest
 
06:41:45.948 --> 06:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
resource since the mid 1980s has
 
06:41:45.958 --> 06:41:48.430 align:start position:0%
resource since the mid 1980s has
increased

06:41:48.430 --> 06:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
increased
 
06:41:51.868 --> 06:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
significantly but no matter
 
06:41:55.190 --> 06:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
how the the quality of the Timber that
 
06:41:57.670 --> 06:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
has grown and has increased in New
 
06:42:01.750 --> 06:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire still about 60 to 70% of the
 
06:42:03.788 --> 06:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
Timber harvested is of low
 
06:42:07.948 --> 06:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
grade two 2/3 of which is biomass and
 
06:42:12.230 --> 06:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
1/3 is which is either pulpwood or
 
06:42:17.948 --> 06:42:17.958 align:start position:0%
firewood so the biomass Market is really
 
06:42:20.430 --> 06:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
the most important significant element
 
06:42:22.628 --> 06:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
we have for proper management of our
 
06:42:25.030 --> 06:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
forest by
 
06:42:28.830 --> 06:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
none uh another benefit although not
 
06:42:31.548 --> 06:42:31.558 align:start position:0%
really spoken about today is the
 
06:42:34.230 --> 06:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
reduction in fire hazards and I think
 
06:42:37.910 --> 06:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
all of us have seen the vast con uh
 
06:42:39.990 --> 06:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
destructive forest fires that have
 
06:42:43.548 --> 06:42:43.558 align:start position:0%
occurred in California and in the west
 
06:42:46.750 --> 06:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
however New Hampshire has experienced
 
06:42:48.270 --> 06:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
some significant
 
06:42:51.590 --> 06:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
fires one being in 1911 and more
 
06:42:55.990 --> 06:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
recently in 1946 now the 1946 fire that
 
06:42:58.788 --> 06:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
people refer to as the Rochester Fire
 
06:43:01.548 --> 06:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
consumes thousands of Acres it was the
 
06:43:04.830 --> 06:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
result of two items one on the hurricane
 
06:43:07.910 --> 06:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
of 1938 which left a lot of residue in
 
06:43:11.190 --> 06:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
the forest and also the harvesting of
 
06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
Timber in in the southern Eastern
 
06:43:17.270 --> 06:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
portion of the of the state and during
 
06:43:19.070 --> 06:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
46 and
 
06:43:22.830 --> 06:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
47 uh rather 45 and 46 we had some very
 
06:43:25.510 --> 06:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
droughty years and there was a buildup
 
06:43:28.910 --> 06:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
of fiber in the forest and the
 
06:43:30.590 --> 06:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
conditions you really need to to have
 
06:43:35.350 --> 06:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
these catastrophic fires is fuel in dry
 
06:43:37.548 --> 06:43:37.558 align:start position:0%
weather in dry conditions and low
 
06:43:41.190 --> 06:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
moisture content in our forest and that
 
06:43:43.388 --> 06:43:43.398 align:start position:0%
is significant of what happened in
 
06:43:46.110 --> 06:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
California and it could happen in the
 
06:43:49.190 --> 06:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
Northeast and mo most recently uh I was
 
06:43:51.510 --> 06:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
in New Jersey when they were having the
 
06:43:53.868 --> 06:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
the forest fires down there and they
 
06:43:55.430 --> 06:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
have a lot of drought and a lot of
 
06:43:58.070 --> 06:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
residue and those fires were very close
 
06:44:01.468 --> 06:44:01.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:07.110 --> 06:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
homes uh final thought please uh yes he
 
06:44:09.430 --> 06:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
said there was a
 
06:44:13.510 --> 06:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
question are you done no I I'm sorry I I
 
06:44:16.270 --> 06:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
just want to point out
 
06:44:18.628 --> 06:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
that although not included in my
 
06:44:20.708 --> 06:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
testimony that New Hampshire is very
 
06:44:22.468 --> 06:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
fortunate we have very clean water you
 
06:44:25.030 --> 06:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
just heard uh an individual talk from
 
06:44:27.270 --> 06:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester about the quality of the
 
06:44:30.110 --> 06:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
water in in New Hampshire also the
 
06:44:33.430 --> 06:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
quality of our forest is is quite good
 
06:44:36.270 --> 06:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
and the significance of a of a really
 
06:44:39.070 --> 06:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
healthy natural resource is represented
 
06:44:40.670 --> 06:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
in a lot of ways in New Hampshire gets a
 
06:44:42.708 --> 06:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
lot of revenue from people who come to
 
06:44:44.590 --> 06:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
look at our forest and enjoy our
 
06:44:47.628 --> 06:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
resources so I just I think that this is
 
06:44:49.708 --> 06:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
important that there a lot of offshoots
 
06:44:51.948 --> 06:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
from the program that is now in
 
06:44:55.270 --> 06:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
existence benefits Society in many ways
 
06:44:56.868 --> 06:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
so thank you very
 
06:44:59.628 --> 06:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
much and I have just about enough time
 
06:45:01.150 --> 06:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
to get home to get to my selectman's
 
06:45:01.160 --> 06:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
to get home to get to my selectman's
meeting

06:45:03.270 --> 06:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
06:45:06.190 --> 06:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that was a good testimony
 
06:45:09.628 --> 06:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
I appreciated U Learning that about the
 
06:45:12.910 --> 06:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
devastating fires in 1911 and
 
06:45:16.070 --> 06:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
1946 because interestingly the most of
 
06:45:18.150 --> 06:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
the towns in New Hampshire recorded
 
06:45:19.628 --> 06:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
their highest
 
06:45:24.990 --> 06:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
temperatures ever in 1911 1944 and 1953
 
06:45:26.510 --> 06:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
those are the three years where most New
 
06:45:28.110 --> 06:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire towns recorded their highest
 
06:45:30.670 --> 06:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
ever temperatures 1911 was a
 
06:45:33.150 --> 06:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
particularly bad year where some some
 
06:45:36.468 --> 06:45:36.478 align:start position:0%
towns recorded temperatures as high as
 
06:45:38.830 --> 06:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
110° and uh we haven't seen anything
 
06:45:41.708 --> 06:45:41.718 align:start position:0%
like that in the last 50 years so that
 
06:45:43.590 --> 06:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
was kind of interesting that fires
 
06:45:45.788 --> 06:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
occurred around the same time okay
 
06:45:47.670 --> 06:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
fascinating stuff so thank you for being
 
06:45:50.990 --> 06:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
here thank you okay seeing no questions
 
06:45:53.788 --> 06:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
we'll next call up Barry Kelly from
 
06:46:01.190 --> 06:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:03.830 --> 06:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
Lumber hello
 
06:46:05.910 --> 06:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
06:46:07.628 --> 06:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your patience with all
 
06:46:10.788 --> 06:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
this um I'm from Berlin New Hampshire
 
06:46:12.948 --> 06:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to go on record as opposing
 
06:46:16.590 --> 06:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 219 and also 257 which I
 
06:46:20.350 --> 06:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
won't be testifying for um we run White
 
06:46:22.910 --> 06:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
Mountain Lumber Company in Berlin um
 
06:46:25.990 --> 06:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's a we and my my family and I and uh
 
06:46:27.788 --> 06:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
we've got the third generation in there
 
06:46:30.788 --> 06:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
now and we're going on to our 80th year
 
06:46:32.628 --> 06:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
we run a sawmill primarily we've grown
 
06:46:35.468 --> 06:46:35.478 align:start position:0%
into retail we couldn't run a sawmill
 
06:46:37.750 --> 06:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
which employs our operation employe over
 
06:46:40.708 --> 06:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
50 people we couldn't do that unless we
 
06:46:43.270 --> 06:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
could have a good market for our wa our
 
06:46:44.590 --> 06:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
I don't want to call it waste I've been
 
06:46:46.910 --> 06:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
criticized for that it's a byproduct
 
06:46:50.070 --> 06:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
bark sawdust wood chips very important
 
06:46:51.548 --> 06:46:51.558 align:start position:0%
we couldn't run we couldn't be
 
06:46:53.990 --> 06:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
profitable without it the biomass plant
 
06:46:56.868 --> 06:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
in Berlin has been a great Boon for us
 
06:46:59.468 --> 06:46:59.478 align:start position:0%
the nice thing about that is we run a su
 
06:47:02.310 --> 06:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
we buy about $2.5 Million worth of logs
 
06:47:05.190 --> 06:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
they come in by truck we process it we
 
06:47:08.388 --> 06:47:08.398 align:start position:0%
ship it outside the area down usually
 
06:47:10.350 --> 06:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
100 miles from here into Massachusetts
 
06:47:12.468 --> 06:47:12.478 align:start position:0%
and rhod Island and we bring that money
 
06:47:14.190 --> 06:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
back into North Country so we're
 
06:47:16.510 --> 06:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
exporting a product that's grown locally
 
06:47:18.270 --> 06:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
and to grow that and to manage it you
 
06:47:20.350 --> 06:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
need to have good forestry good
 
06:47:22.468 --> 06:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
low-grade markets are important to good
 
06:47:25.788 --> 06:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
forestry just as um Bob mentioned it's
 
06:47:28.150 --> 06:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
very important and it's also important
 
06:47:31.990 --> 06:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
in keeping the the uh loggers healthy if
 
06:47:34.788 --> 06:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
they can't cut property and move the
 
06:47:37.510 --> 06:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
biomass they can't get property to cut
 
06:47:39.030 --> 06:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
because people won't let you leave it on
 
06:47:41.670 --> 06:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
the ground anymore in fact some places
 
06:47:42.830 --> 06:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
that are in the southern part of the
 
06:47:46.030 --> 06:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
state are charging land owners to chip
 
06:47:47.910 --> 06:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
their wood because it's so far to haul
 
06:47:50.110 --> 06:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
it so it's important to have these
 
06:47:53.948 --> 06:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
markets around um we also the nice thing
 
06:47:56.468 --> 06:47:56.478 align:start position:0%
about biomass when we argued or or
 
06:47:58.670 --> 06:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
testified to have it in Burl and have
 
06:48:01.510 --> 06:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
the the city approve it was we're we're
 
06:48:04.310 --> 06:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
bringing in wood that's gr locally we're
 
06:48:06.868 --> 06:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
exporting a product all over the country
 
06:48:08.830 --> 06:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
but we don't have to use the roads which
 
06:48:11.430 --> 06:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
are few and fire good roads are fire few
 
06:48:13.510 --> 06:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
and fire between and Berlin we can
 
06:48:16.070 --> 06:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
export all over without using highways
 
06:48:18.388 --> 06:48:18.398 align:start position:0%
so it's a good selling point for
 
06:48:21.990 --> 06:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we we need electricity there's no
 
06:48:23.948 --> 06:48:23.958 align:start position:0%
question look at what's look at the
 
06:48:26.270 --> 06:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
prediction number in addition to
 
06:48:28.430 --> 06:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
electric cars just look at the amount of
 
06:48:30.310 --> 06:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
electricity they're talking about using
 
06:48:33.030 --> 06:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
in AI where's the electricity going to
 
06:48:35.670 --> 06:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
come from I just don't see that it's
 
06:48:38.708 --> 06:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
prudent to close down plants to use a
 
06:48:40.388 --> 06:48:40.398 align:start position:0%
local product that are clean and
 
06:48:43.190 --> 06:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
dependable and making electricity we
 
06:48:46.788 --> 06:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
need self sustain we need we need uh
 
06:48:49.468 --> 06:48:49.478 align:start position:0%
reliability and self-sufficiency and I
 
06:48:52.830 --> 06:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
think biom biomass Plants provide that I
 
06:48:54.830 --> 06:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a boon to the North Country a
 
06:48:57.190 --> 06:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
boon to the whole state and I uh thank
 
06:49:00.510 --> 06:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
you for listening to me any
 
06:49:03.468 --> 06:49:03.478 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you thank you
 
06:49:06.350 --> 06:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
no questions and so next we'll turn
 
06:49:08.350 --> 06:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
to Thomas
 
06:49:11.430 --> 06:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
Christensen of 12
 
06:49:11.440 --> 06:49:14.590 align:start position:0%
Christensen of 12
Western

06:49:14.590 --> 06:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:18.110 --> 06:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
Way CH had to leave but heed me
 
06:49:27.070 --> 06:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:29.708 --> 06:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
okay so then we'll have Nick coff come
 
06:50:00.468 --> 06:50:00.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:01.948 --> 06:50:01.958 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon I'm Nick cof again
 
06:50:03.990 --> 06:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
with the conservation Foundation um
 
06:50:05.230 --> 06:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here today and for
 
06:50:07.430 --> 06:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
being engaged this late in the day I'm
 
06:50:10.030 --> 06:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
here to testify an opposition to HB
 
06:50:12.070 --> 06:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
219 as we've heard today the RPS
 
06:50:14.670 --> 06:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
provides many benefits to the state um
 
06:50:16.590 --> 06:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
Renewables provide significant economic
 
06:50:18.350 --> 06:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
and job benefits to the state U
 
06:50:20.990 --> 06:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
currently there are 3500 people employed
 
06:50:23.910 --> 06:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the renewable sector in New Hampshire
 
06:50:26.670 --> 06:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
um and know today around $800 million
 
06:50:28.948 --> 06:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
has been invested in the state solar
 
06:50:31.310 --> 06:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
industry um without the RPS New
 
06:50:33.468 --> 06:50:33.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stands a lose out on these
 
06:50:36.030 --> 06:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
benefits while our neighbors which all
 
06:50:38.110 --> 06:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
of renewable portfolio standards reap
 
06:50:38.120 --> 06:50:39.070 align:start position:0%
of renewable portfolio standards reap
the

06:50:39.070 --> 06:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:50:41.070 --> 06:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
benefits um one of the purposes of the
 
06:50:42.948 --> 06:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
RPS statute which is right there on the
 
06:50:44.990 --> 06:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
statute written there is to provide fuel
 
06:50:47.628 --> 06:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
diversity um to reduce exposure to
 
06:50:51.708 --> 06:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
volatile fuel prices um you know the
 
06:50:53.590 --> 06:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
Region's over dependence on fossil fuels
 
06:50:55.548 --> 06:50:55.558 align:start position:0%
has contributed to price spikes over the
 
06:50:58.788 --> 06:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
past few years and um however increased
 
06:51:01.070 --> 06:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
investments in Renewables provide energy
 
06:51:03.270 --> 06:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
diversity benefits for the state
 
06:51:04.510 --> 06:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
um which can insulate families and
 
06:51:07.230 --> 06:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
businesses from um those price
 
06:51:10.030 --> 06:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
spikes um and eliminating the RPS would
 
06:51:11.670 --> 06:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
make the state even more vulnerable to
 
06:51:13.670 --> 06:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
those price spikes that we see from time
 
06:51:15.788 --> 06:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
to time um which could result in even
 
06:51:17.510 --> 06:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
higher energy prices for New Hampshire's
 
06:51:19.750 --> 06:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
families and businesses um and then
 
06:51:20.708 --> 06:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
finally I want to talk about something
 
06:51:21.788 --> 06:51:21.798 align:start position:0%
that I don't think anybody else has
 
06:51:24.548 --> 06:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned today um but it's that the RPS
 
06:51:26.708 --> 06:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
provides public health benefits to the
 
06:51:30.150 --> 06:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
state um increase Renewables they reduce
 
06:51:31.990 --> 06:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
pollution resulting from the combustion
 
06:51:34.830 --> 06:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
of fossil fuels um which cont
 
06:51:37.430 --> 06:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
contributes to our exacerbates asthma
 
06:51:39.548 --> 06:51:39.558 align:start position:0%
and other respiratory problems heart
 
06:51:43.430 --> 06:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
disease cancer Etc um fossil fuel
 
06:51:46.628 --> 06:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
combustion is a significant source of
 
06:51:48.430 --> 06:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
particular matter particularly
 
06:51:50.548 --> 06:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
particular matter uh
 
06:51:54.430 --> 06:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
2.5 um and Nationwide PM 2.5 causes
 
06:51:56.948 --> 06:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
53,000 deaths a year in the United
 
06:51:59.788 --> 06:51:59.798 align:start position:0%
States um with you know around $600
 
06:52:02.110 --> 06:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
billion dollar in health costs so
 
06:52:03.868 --> 06:52:03.878 align:start position:0%
getting rid of New Hampshire's RPS it
 
06:52:06.230 --> 06:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
will um you know increase power
 
06:52:08.788 --> 06:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
generation from fossil fuel sources and
 
06:52:10.510 --> 06:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
be detrimental to the health of of our
 
06:52:12.750 --> 06:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
citizens in our state um so for these
 
06:52:14.910 --> 06:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge you to vote against or to
 
06:52:20.270 --> 06:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:20.280 --> 06:52:22.150 align:start position:0%
 
questions

06:52:22.150 --> 06:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:52:26.270 --> 06:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative Thomas thank you um
 
06:52:29.310 --> 06:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned and and this seems obvious
 
06:52:32.788 --> 06:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
but but I didn't hear it so clear C ly
 
06:52:35.868 --> 06:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
spoken that if we remove the Rex if we
 
06:52:38.948 --> 06:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
remove RPS and the surrounding states
 
06:52:41.830 --> 06:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
don't that's going to impact us greatly
 
06:52:44.708 --> 06:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
economically correct yes I mean um you
 
06:52:46.990 --> 06:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
know the the the RPS does attract
 
06:52:48.468 --> 06:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
investments in the renewable industry in
 
06:52:50.270 --> 06:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
the state so all those other states
 
06:52:52.430 --> 06:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
still have RPS so it'll just mean those
 
06:52:55.468 --> 06:52:55.478 align:start position:0%
Investments happen in other states yes
 
06:52:58.150 --> 06:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you okay seeing no further
 
06:53:00.990 --> 06:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
questions we'll um move next to Meredith
 
06:53:01.000 --> 06:53:02.548 align:start position:0%
questions we'll um move next to Meredith
Hatfield

06:53:02.548 --> 06:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
Hatfield
 
06:53:17.110 --> 06:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:19.830 --> 06:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
Conservancy thank you um Mr chairman
 
06:53:21.030 --> 06:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Meredith
 
06:53:24.190 --> 06:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
Hatfield for The Nature Conservancy um I
 
06:53:26.150 --> 06:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
do have a brief testimony letter going
 
06:53:29.628 --> 06:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
around uh we do oppose House Bill 219
 
06:53:32.190 --> 06:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
and also House Bill 567 which I may not
 
06:53:34.510 --> 06:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
be here for when you hear it so I
 
06:53:36.788 --> 06:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
thought I would mention that now uh we
 
06:53:38.190 --> 06:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
agree with a lot of the points that have
 
06:53:40.150 --> 06:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
been raised um and we wanted to point
 
06:53:43.430 --> 06:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
out that um the RPS helps us meet the
 
06:53:45.510 --> 06:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
state's energy needs through Innovation
 
06:53:47.910 --> 06:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
and competition while promoting local
 
06:53:49.990 --> 06:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
energy sources and protecting our health
 
06:53:52.468 --> 06:53:52.478 align:start position:0%
and environment locally produced energy
 
06:53:54.190 --> 06:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
reduces our need for electricity from
 
06:53:56.468 --> 06:53:56.478 align:start position:0%
the regional grid which faces
 
06:53:58.230 --> 06:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
significant price volatility at
 
06:54:00.788 --> 06:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
different times of the year tools such
 
06:54:03.910 --> 06:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
as the RPS and the renewable energy fund
 
06:54:05.590 --> 06:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
that is Created from alternative
 
06:54:08.150 --> 06:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
compliance payments helps municipalities
 
06:54:10.190 --> 06:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
businesses and residents reduce their
 
06:54:12.910 --> 06:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
Reliance on imported fuels and increase
 
06:54:12.920 --> 06:54:14.230 align:start position:0%
Reliance on imported fuels and increase
their

06:54:14.230 --> 06:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:54:17.468 --> 06:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
resilience I also wanted to mention that
 
06:54:20.910 --> 06:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
um you probably are aware that within
 
06:54:24.590 --> 06:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
the RPS law RSA 362
 
06:54:29.948 --> 06:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
F5 there's a requirement um that Doe uh
 
06:54:33.110 --> 06:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
conduct regular reviews of the RPS yes
 
06:54:35.150 --> 06:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
and the next review that's required by
 
06:54:37.670 --> 06:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
Statute is due on November 1st of this
 
06:54:40.708 --> 06:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
year so we would respectfully request
 
06:54:43.230 --> 06:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
that you find both bills in expedient to
 
06:54:45.830 --> 06:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
legislate uh or in the alternative if
 
06:54:48.590 --> 06:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
you feel as though um further review is
 
06:54:50.708 --> 06:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
needed of the RPS law that you wait
 
06:54:53.670 --> 06:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
until that report is issued on November
 
06:54:56.110 --> 06:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
1st um by retaining the bill and then
 
06:54:58.430 --> 06:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
you could consider uh changes that might
 
06:55:01.948 --> 06:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
be uh prudent at that time I also wanted
 
06:55:05.310 --> 06:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
to to um amplify something that someone
 
06:55:07.150 --> 06:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
else raised earlier which is that there
 
06:55:09.190 --> 06:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
is an escape valve currently I believe
 
06:55:12.110 --> 06:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's just for classes three and four um
 
06:55:13.708 --> 06:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
so that is something that you could
 
06:55:17.230 --> 06:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
consider once you had that that full um
 
06:55:19.468 --> 06:55:19.478 align:start position:0%
review in hand from the New Hampshire
 
06:55:21.510 --> 06:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
Department of energy thank
 
06:55:25.388 --> 06:55:25.398 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you seeing no questions
 
06:55:27.190 --> 06:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
we'll move next to Matt Ley of the
 
06:55:36.548 --> 06:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:38.548 --> 06:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chairman uh
 
06:55:40.388 --> 06:55:40.398 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Matt Ley I'm the
 
06:55:42.548 --> 06:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
public policy director for the society
 
06:55:43.948 --> 06:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
for the protection of New Hampshire
 
06:55:47.030 --> 06:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
Forest we are a land trust so we protect
 
06:55:50.430 --> 06:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
land we're also a forestry organization
 
06:55:51.948 --> 06:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
so we actually
 
06:55:54.590 --> 06:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
manage uh the forest lands that we do
 
06:55:57.310 --> 06:55:57.320 align:start position:0%
own um so we do have an interest in in
 
06:55:59.310 --> 06:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
this discussion but I would just wanted
 
06:56:02.310 --> 06:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
to make one point and it's uh several
 
06:56:04.548 --> 06:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
the prior speakers made this but really
 
06:56:08.070 --> 06:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
the we think one of the key points about
 
06:56:10.868 --> 06:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
the RPS is that it does encourage
 
06:56:14.388 --> 06:56:14.398 align:start position:0%
incentivize local renewable energy
 
06:56:16.708 --> 06:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
sources and that that's an important
 
06:56:20.070 --> 06:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
Point um you know for society is
 
06:56:23.230 --> 06:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
probably most interested in markets for
 
06:56:28.150 --> 06:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
lowgrade wood U bi the biomass um energy
 
06:56:30.350 --> 06:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
facilities are certainly one of those so
 
06:56:33.788 --> 06:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
we would um be very concerned um if
 
06:56:35.510 --> 06:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
those markets which have been under
 
06:56:38.990 --> 06:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
stress are further weakened so again we
 
06:56:40.830 --> 06:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill we also oppose the next
 
06:56:42.830 --> 06:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
bill you'll be hearing but I'll be happy
 
06:56:44.590 --> 06:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
06:56:44.600 --> 06:56:46.270 align:start position:0%
to take any
questions

06:56:46.270 --> 06:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:56:48.830 --> 06:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no questions want to thank
 
06:56:51.030 --> 06:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
you and turn next
 
06:56:51.040 --> 06:56:53.270 align:start position:0%
you and turn next
to

06:56:53.270 --> 06:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:56:59.110 --> 06:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:04.190 --> 06:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:06.670 --> 06:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
sis thank you chairperson it's glad to
 
06:57:08.350 --> 06:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
be back here again and members of the
 
06:57:10.468 --> 06:57:10.478 align:start position:0%
board my name is Jared Muller and I'm
 
06:57:12.510 --> 06:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
submitting testimony on behalf of misus
 
06:57:15.270 --> 06:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
to express our opposition of House Bill
 
06:57:17.628 --> 06:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
219 the RPS is essential to New
 
06:57:19.670 --> 06:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's renable energy development
 
06:57:21.750 --> 06:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
supporting local sustainable energy
 
06:57:24.548 --> 06:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
resources especially wood which has long
 
06:57:27.590 --> 06:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
been recognized as America's first fuel
 
06:57:30.750 --> 06:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
modern efficient efficient wood Energy
 
06:57:32.788 --> 06:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
Systems provide affordable reliable
 
06:57:35.350 --> 06:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
power while strengthening the Region's
 
06:57:39.110 --> 06:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
energy security eliminating the RPS
 
06:57:40.350 --> 06:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
would harm New Hampshire's Forest
 
06:57:41.830 --> 06:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
economy reducing the demand for
 
06:57:44.430 --> 06:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits that support
 
06:57:46.590 --> 06:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
responsible forestry job creation and
 
06:57:48.190 --> 06:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
the productive use of low-grade wood
 
06:57:50.310 --> 06:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
byproducts without these incentives wood
 
06:57:52.948 --> 06:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
energy producers and related Industries
 
06:57:54.830 --> 06:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
would face economic hardship leading to
 
06:57:57.070 --> 06:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
job losses and increased Reliance on
 
06:57:59.628 --> 06:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels at a time when New England
 
06:58:01.750 --> 06:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
is working towards energy Independence
 
06:58:03.590 --> 06:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
we can in the RPS would put New
 
06:58:06.708 --> 06:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at a competitive disadvantage
 
06:58:08.628 --> 06:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
slowing Clean Energy progress and
 
06:58:11.230 --> 06:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
increasing long-term energy costs we
 
06:58:14.150 --> 06:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to reject HB 219 and
 
06:58:15.868 --> 06:58:15.878 align:start position:0%
appold a strong market-driven renewable
 
06:58:17.468 --> 06:58:17.478 align:start position:0%
energy policy that benefits local
 
06:58:20.070 --> 06:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
economies project protects jobs and

07:00:11.910 --> 07:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
Mr stock you're up okay thank you I just
 
07:00:15.350 --> 07:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure we're good to go um
 
07:00:17.150 --> 07:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jason stock
 
07:00:18.548 --> 07:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the New
 
07:00:20.948 --> 07:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
 
07:00:22.628 --> 07:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
you've heard from several of our members
 
07:00:26.750 --> 07:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
today about the value of biomass and and
 
07:00:31.750 --> 07:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
the rpss role in biomass um the RPS law
 
07:00:34.350 --> 07:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
is is an area where utility policy meets
 
07:00:36.750 --> 07:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
natural resource management whether it's
 
07:00:39.628 --> 07:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
a watershed in Manchester a piece of
 
07:00:43.788 --> 07:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
forest land in in rumney or or a piece
 
07:00:47.190 --> 07:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
of or a sawmill operation up in in
 
07:00:52.468 --> 07:00:52.478 align:start position:0%
Berlin um our you know the coming around
 
07:00:55.990 --> 07:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
is a copy of you'll see this green page
 
07:00:57.270 --> 07:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go through the whole
 
07:01:01.310 --> 07:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
document whoops I'll get it later um it
 
07:01:04.030 --> 07:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
that is the well thank you Jody that is
 
07:01:07.948 --> 07:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
USDA Forest analysis what this does is
 
07:01:11.388 --> 07:01:11.398 align:start position:0%
that's a USDA does a Statewide survey of
 
07:01:14.388 --> 07:01:14.398 align:start position:0%
the state's Forest once every five years
 
07:01:16.948 --> 07:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
they do it to all the forested states
 
07:01:19.670 --> 07:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
what this shows is that New Hampshire
 
07:01:23.670 --> 07:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
has a robust forest and as a consequence
 
07:01:25.948 --> 07:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
we have a robust Forest economy we
 
07:01:28.468 --> 07:01:28.478 align:start position:0%
continue to grow more wood than we
 
07:01:31.548 --> 07:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
Harvest um the unfortunate thing is that
 
07:01:33.548 --> 07:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
in as you heard earlier about two-thirds
 
07:01:36.430 --> 07:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
of that wood is considered low grade so
 
07:01:38.628 --> 07:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
like your garden when you're growing a
 
07:01:41.990 --> 07:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
garden you you want to grow nice quality
 
07:01:43.910 --> 07:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
carrots you have to go out and do some
 
07:01:46.468 --> 07:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
weeding and thinning at some point in
 
07:01:48.548 --> 07:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
the season to ensure that those carrots
 
07:01:50.430 --> 07:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
that remain are the high quality carrots
 
07:01:52.270 --> 07:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
that you want to take into the kitchen
 
07:01:57.750 --> 07:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
and eat so biomass is a tool that's used
 
07:01:59.548 --> 07:01:59.558 align:start position:0%
it's a low-grade market and it's a tool
 
07:02:01.150 --> 07:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
that's used for that weeding and
 
07:02:01.160 --> 07:02:02.830 align:start position:0%
that's used for that weeding and
thinning

07:02:02.830 --> 07:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
thinning
 
07:02:05.868 --> 07:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
um it's it occurs across the state I
 
07:02:09.070 --> 07:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
took a little dive deep dive into the
 
07:02:11.350 --> 07:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
the uh intent to cut there's a Timber
 
07:02:14.430 --> 07:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
tax in New Hampshire every town reports
 
07:02:16.590 --> 07:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
Timber taxes when there's a commercial
 
07:02:18.030 --> 07:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
Timber sale in the state of New
 
07:02:21.868 --> 07:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they record the volumes and in
 
07:02:24.708 --> 07:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
2023 there were
 
07:02:24.718 --> 07:02:26.270 align:start position:0%
2023 there were
5833

07:02:26.270 --> 07:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
5833
 
07:02:32.230 --> 07:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
196 tons of biomass harvested across 174
 
07:02:35.750 --> 07:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
towns some of these were large large
 
07:02:38.948 --> 07:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
commercial Timber sales on the side of a
 
07:02:41.070 --> 07:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
mountain in Orford but some of them were
 
07:02:44.310 --> 07:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
small clearings for for residential
 
07:02:47.190 --> 07:02:47.200 align:start position:0%

07:02:50.030 --> 07:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:02:50.040 --> 07:02:51.788 align:start position:0%
the
state

07:02:51.788 --> 07:02:51.798 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:02:54.910 --> 07:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
NHA hired Plymouth State it's about it's
 
07:02:57.948 --> 07:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
been 10 years to do an analysis looking
 
07:03:00.708 --> 07:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
at the economics that come from Timber
 
07:03:00.718 --> 07:03:02.270 align:start position:0%
at the economics that come from Timber
harvesting

07:03:02.270 --> 07:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
harvesting
 
07:03:05.708 --> 07:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
and we did this in 2012 every truckload
 
07:03:09.548 --> 07:03:09.558 align:start position:0%
of logs in 2012 granted things have gone
 
07:03:12.150 --> 07:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
up every truckload of logs or wood chips
 
07:03:15.310 --> 07:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
you see going down the road there's
 
07:03:18.388 --> 07:03:18.398 align:start position:0%
$1,684 of economic activity that go into
 
07:03:21.750 --> 07:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
that log that that to get that truck on
 
07:03:23.830 --> 07:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
the road and get it to the
 
07:03:27.990 --> 07:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
mill to put things in perspective
 
07:03:32.310 --> 07:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
583 th000 tons equals almost 20 ,000
 
07:03:35.590 --> 07:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
truck loads that that put this in
 
07:03:37.270 --> 07:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
perspective we're talking about $32
 
07:03:40.110 --> 07:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
million of economic activity that occur
 
07:03:45.070 --> 07:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
across the state in 174 towns um so
 
07:03:48.150 --> 07:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
there's this biomass thing is really
 
07:03:50.590 --> 07:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
important for the state the state's
 
07:03:54.110 --> 07:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
Forest economy and Timberland owners you
 
07:03:56.830 --> 07:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
heard about the Land Management options
 
07:03:59.430 --> 07:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's used as we it's used for Forest
 
07:04:01.310 --> 07:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
Health it's used for Aesthetics it's
 
07:04:03.910 --> 07:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
used for for recreation it's also an
 
07:04:06.670 --> 07:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
important piece of of the logging
 
07:04:08.468 --> 07:04:08.478 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the
 
07:04:11.868 --> 07:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
markets um that are associated with it
 
07:04:14.110 --> 07:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
and then of course the the the for the
 
07:04:17.750 --> 07:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
Sawmills the byproducts don't call it
 
07:04:19.628 --> 07:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
wood waste the byproducts that come from
 
07:04:22.230 --> 07:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
the Sawmills it's an important it's an
 
07:04:26.310 --> 07:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's a critical market for them and also
 
07:04:29.708 --> 07:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
as you also heard when you see a
 
07:04:33.110 --> 07:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
contraction in Timber in markets there's
 
07:04:36.230 --> 07:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
a contraction in logging capacity we saw
 
07:04:39.070 --> 07:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
this when the biomass plants we Lo a
 
07:04:41.350 --> 07:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
number of biomas plants shut down about
 
07:04:43.350 --> 07:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago we saw an
 
07:04:45.670 --> 07:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
immediate contraction in logging
 
07:04:49.388 --> 07:04:49.398 align:start position:0%
capacity and what also happened was a
 
07:04:52.468 --> 07:04:52.478 align:start position:0%
subsequent contraction in log in in saw
 
07:04:54.910 --> 07:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
log delivery so many of these Sawmills
 
07:04:57.868 --> 07:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
that you also see are suffering or
 
07:05:00.230 --> 07:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
struggling to get saw logs because that
 
07:05:01.910 --> 07:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
company that used to have two two or
 
07:05:04.350 --> 07:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
three crews out working on the landscape
 
07:05:06.430 --> 07:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
producing biomass and at the same time
 
07:05:09.310 --> 07:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
producing logs may have only one crew
 
07:05:11.750 --> 07:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
because they can only Market one Crews
 
07:05:12.788 --> 07:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
worth of
 
07:05:15.868 --> 07:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
biomass and as a result that one crew
 
07:05:18.190 --> 07:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
there's two two Crews worth of Saw logs
 
07:05:20.990 --> 07:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
that aren't getting cut as well um final
 
07:05:24.388 --> 07:05:24.398 align:start position:0%
point please my final point is that
 
07:05:26.030 --> 07:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Doug
 
07:05:28.750 --> 07:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
Thomas representative Doug Thomas
 
07:05:31.310 --> 07:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose had the foresight to
 
07:05:31.320 --> 07:05:32.788 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose had the foresight to
commiss

07:05:32.788 --> 07:05:32.798 align:start position:0%
commiss
 
07:05:35.030 --> 07:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
that low-grade Timber and wood supply
 
07:05:38.110 --> 07:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
document that Jo jod grimas had passed
 
07:05:41.230 --> 07:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
out earlier and if you look at page four
 
07:05:44.350 --> 07:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
and it's highlighted page four one of
 
07:05:46.948 --> 07:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
the key findings is and this is when we
 
07:05:48.708 --> 07:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
talk about Market
 
07:05:51.510 --> 07:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
retention um one of the key points is is
 
07:05:53.510 --> 07:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
that you keep you try to keep what you
 
07:05:56.750 --> 07:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
can and in that report it could not be
 
07:05:59.468 --> 07:05:59.478 align:start position:0%
any clear about the important role that
 
07:06:03.030 --> 07:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
the RPS and policies like that play in
 
07:06:04.788 --> 07:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
this intersection with the state's
 
07:06:06.990 --> 07:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
natural resource management natural
 
07:06:09.150 --> 07:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
resource community and just Land
 
07:06:12.030 --> 07:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
Management in general so that I'll leave
 
07:06:15.230 --> 07:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
that report with you the the the other
 
07:06:18.190 --> 07:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
the last the very last point I'll make
 
07:06:22.070 --> 07:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
is um since the biomass those closures
 
07:06:24.230 --> 07:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of biomass plants
 
07:06:26.788 --> 07:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
start to come back online trying to make
 
07:06:30.388 --> 07:06:30.398 align:start position:0%
it trying to make a go of it um there
 
07:06:32.388 --> 07:06:32.398 align:start position:0%
there are four there there are now three
 
07:06:35.070 --> 07:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
that are kind of running the RPS as you
 
07:06:38.750 --> 07:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
heard from Mr O is is one of three
 
07:06:42.190 --> 07:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
revenue streams that are critical you
 
07:06:45.468 --> 07:06:45.478 align:start position:0%
pull that RPS out the economics
 
07:06:48.590 --> 07:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
completely the completely C in and it
 
07:06:51.830 --> 07:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
they don't work and so keep we have a
 
07:06:53.628 --> 07:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
level of we finally feel like we have a
 
07:06:56.788 --> 07:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
level of stability in this biomass World
 
07:06:59.910 --> 07:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
we're no longer freef falling passage of
 
07:07:02.230 --> 07:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
two 219
 
07:07:04.670 --> 07:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
will keep that will just push us over
 
07:07:06.910 --> 07:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
the edge and keep that freef fall going
 
07:07:09.230 --> 07:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
we've got to maintain the maintain that
 
07:07:13.590 --> 07:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
level of of stability and so with that
 
07:07:16.708 --> 07:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
um the other item Tom Thompson who who
 
07:07:19.708 --> 07:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
had a medical uh situation today
 
07:07:21.948 --> 07:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it but Tom Thompson a tree
 
07:07:24.468 --> 07:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
farmer from Orford he did give me his
 
07:07:26.788 --> 07:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
letter of testimony which I is also
 
07:07:29.750 --> 07:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
circulated around um he too
 
07:07:34.750 --> 07:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
opposes uh house Bill 219 and House Bill
 
07:07:37.110 --> 07:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
567 happy to try and answer any
 
07:07:41.150 --> 07:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:44.270 --> 07:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
Indulgence representative Thomas thank
 
07:07:48.708 --> 07:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um just trying to clarify
 
07:07:50.310 --> 07:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
something you said um you said that when
 
07:07:53.110 --> 07:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
you do a harvest 2third is low grade
 
07:07:55.468 --> 07:07:55.478 align:start position:0%
Timber um if I heard that correctly I'm
 
07:07:58.708 --> 07:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
getting a little tired um why isn't
 
07:08:00.788 --> 07:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
2third high-grade Timber are we doing
 
07:08:02.830 --> 07:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
something wrong or is that just the way
 
07:08:05.110 --> 07:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
the cookie crumbles you know I blame a
 
07:08:06.830 --> 07:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
lot of these Foresters behind me for
 
07:08:09.788 --> 07:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
that what have they been doing no it's
 
07:08:12.510 --> 07:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's it it's 2third and it's two-thirds
 
07:08:14.510 --> 07:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
if you're lucky you know two-thirds is
 
07:08:17.270 --> 07:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
growing out there um it's a nature of
 
07:08:21.190 --> 07:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
our forest okay um it's the the types of
 
07:08:24.190 --> 07:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
trees that we have you know in in the
 
07:08:26.030 --> 07:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
types of trees that we're growing it's
 
07:08:28.788 --> 07:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
also a function of past Land Management
 
07:08:31.628 --> 07:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
practices um if you if you think of a
 
07:08:34.150 --> 07:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know think of a let's let's pick a
 
07:08:37.388 --> 07:08:37.398 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite species a sugar maple
 
07:08:41.590 --> 07:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
if you harvest that sugar maple that
 
07:08:45.708 --> 07:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
top eight if you're lucky 16 to 20 feet
 
07:08:48.548 --> 07:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
is your saw log that's the quality but
 
07:08:50.750 --> 07:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
you have branches you have Twigs you
 
07:08:53.190 --> 07:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
have you know branches large branches
 
07:08:56.070 --> 07:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
coming up that's all low grade oh okay
 
07:08:58.510 --> 07:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
so so it's that but it's also that
 
07:09:01.030 --> 07:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
Little Thicket of red Maples that are
 
07:09:03.310 --> 07:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
growing next to that sugar maple that
 
07:09:05.868 --> 07:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
are just waiting to try to take over
 
07:09:09.070 --> 07:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
that wood lot and red maple beautiful
 
07:09:11.868 --> 07:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
species I love it but it's an aggressive
 
07:09:14.310 --> 07:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
species and if at the end of the day if
 
07:09:15.910 --> 07:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
you're a land owner and you're looking
 
07:09:17.948 --> 07:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
at growing quality and you're also
 
07:09:20.270 --> 07:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
looking at return on investment you want
 
07:09:22.190 --> 07:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
to be growing those sugar Maples you
 
07:09:24.590 --> 07:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
want to be growing those white pines and
 
07:09:26.868 --> 07:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
so when you're out there doing your
 
07:09:29.590 --> 07:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
management you need to have markets for
 
07:09:32.548 --> 07:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
that scraggly Thicket of red Maple
 
07:09:34.388 --> 07:09:34.398 align:start position:0%
because if you don't the red maple will
 
07:09:37.350 --> 07:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
be left to its own devices and over time
 
07:09:41.230 --> 07:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
you'll have a a lower quality wood lot
 
07:09:45.110 --> 07:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
and consequently lower quality Timber
 
07:09:47.510 --> 07:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
and you'll have a sawmill saying Hey
 
07:09:49.230 --> 07:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
where's that quality of logs you used to
 
07:09:51.750 --> 07:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
send me all you have is this you know
 
07:09:53.788 --> 07:09:53.798 align:start position:0%
scraggly red maple I used to like those
 
07:09:55.190 --> 07:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
white pine
 
07:09:57.750 --> 07:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
logs this is what happens granted it's
 
07:10:00.750 --> 07:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
overtime but that's kind of the Dynamics
 
07:10:02.190 --> 07:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
that are at place play here if you don't
 
07:10:04.868 --> 07:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
have markets for this low grade again
 
07:10:07.030 --> 07:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
fascinating thank
 
07:10:09.670 --> 07:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
you all right seeing no more questions I
 
07:10:11.910 --> 07:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for your thank you
 
07:10:14.670 --> 07:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
very timely uh testimony and great
 
07:10:17.990 --> 07:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
information next up is Lynn sweet of uh
 
07:10:21.110 --> 07:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
sweet logging
 
07:10:25.670 --> 07:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
and land clearing something yeah land
 
07:10:28.948 --> 07:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
clearing okay thank you chairman and the
 
07:10:30.670 --> 07:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee members for the opportunity to
 
07:10:33.030 --> 07:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
testify to today I think I hopefully
 
07:10:34.548 --> 07:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
will be the one that shows you about the
 
07:10:37.948 --> 07:10:37.958 align:start position:0%
little muscle that is behind all the
 
07:10:40.708 --> 07:10:40.718 align:start position:0%
biomass that gets to these Mills my name
 
07:10:42.948 --> 07:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
is Lynn sweet I'm a co-owner of sweets
 
07:10:44.628 --> 07:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
logging and land clearing a company
 
07:10:46.830 --> 07:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
based out of straford New Hampshire my
 
07:10:48.628 --> 07:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
husband and I have been operating over
 
07:10:51.510 --> 07:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
30 years we have five employees who live
 
07:10:53.948 --> 07:10:53.958 align:start position:0%
in straford Northwood Barnstead
 
07:10:55.948 --> 07:10:55.958 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield and one that travels down
 
07:10:55.958 --> 07:10:56.868 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield and one that travels down
from

07:10:56.868 --> 07:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:10:59.230 --> 07:10:59.240 align:start position:0%
Grafton uh my husband and I personally
 
07:11:01.590 --> 07:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
own 200 acres in the town of straford
 
07:11:04.110 --> 07:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
and at this time our land is open to
 
07:11:05.910 --> 07:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
Winter Recreation with a snowmobile
 
07:11:08.070 --> 07:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
trail that connects important corridors
 
07:11:10.190 --> 07:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
leading to Rockingham and bellnap
 
07:11:13.150 --> 07:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
counties a little nervous
 
07:11:15.628 --> 07:11:15.638 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm also the chairman of the
 
07:11:17.910 --> 07:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
select board in the town of straford and
 
07:11:20.830 --> 07:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
have served my town for 16 plus years
 
07:11:23.270 --> 07:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
our town has at least 12 families that I
 
07:11:25.070 --> 07:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
personally know that are in the logging
 
07:11:28.070 --> 07:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
industry include both harvesting and
 
07:11:30.670 --> 07:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
trucking just a little snapshot of our
 
07:11:33.750 --> 07:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
company our payroll average is about
 
07:11:37.270 --> 07:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
272 um, a year our average operating
 
07:11:40.430 --> 07:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
cost is about 1.5 million a year we paid
 
07:11:43.030 --> 07:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
a total of 210,000 in stumpage payments
 
07:11:47.110 --> 07:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
to land owners in 23 that if not more in
 
07:11:49.830 --> 07:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
2024 this also translates to an average
 
07:11:52.430 --> 07:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
of 21,000 each year going back into the
 
07:11:54.548 --> 07:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities for payments for Timber
 
07:11:57.388 --> 07:11:57.398 align:start position:0%
tax this does not include any monies
 
07:11:59.468 --> 07:11:59.478 align:start position:0%
also gained from the current use penalty
 
07:12:02.270 --> 07:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
for conversion of land when developing
 
07:12:04.190 --> 07:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
which could be an additional $5,000 to
 
07:12:07.270 --> 07:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
$20,000 per lot this is a good amount of
 
07:12:09.070 --> 07:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
money going back into our local towns
 
07:12:11.670 --> 07:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
and Community communities generated from
 
07:12:13.948 --> 07:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
our small Logging
 
07:12:16.788 --> 07:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
Company why am I opposing these bills
 
07:12:19.670 --> 07:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
which I should say I'm opposing Bill 219
 
07:12:21.910 --> 07:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 567 but I know we're
 
07:12:25.430 --> 07:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
talking about 219 by removing amending
 
07:12:27.190 --> 07:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy classes one and
 
07:12:28.708 --> 07:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
three and phasing out the electric
 
07:12:31.350 --> 07:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standards this could
 
07:12:33.948 --> 07:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
 our industry overnight and
 
07:12:35.708 --> 07:12:35.718 align:start position:0%
affect many other Industries such as
 
07:12:38.350 --> 07:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
Trucking Mills equipment mechanics land
 
07:12:41.628 --> 07:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
owners Foresters and Beyond this bill
 
07:12:43.788 --> 07:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
would force our industry to reinvent the
 
07:12:45.910 --> 07:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
wheel even though this proverbial wheel
 
07:12:47.948 --> 07:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
has a few flat spots worn into it
 
07:12:50.948 --> 07:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
already but it works instead you should
 
07:12:53.150 --> 07:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
be sporting our industry that is one of
 
07:12:54.990 --> 07:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
the founding Industries in New Hampshire
 
07:12:57.388 --> 07:12:57.398 align:start position:0%
and still a very much needed industry
 
07:12:59.670 --> 07:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
that provides a natural resource that is
 
07:13:01.868 --> 07:13:01.878 align:start position:0%
already here and can assist our power
 
07:13:04.430 --> 07:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
grid we Harvest timber for both state
 
07:13:06.548 --> 07:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
lands and in the private sector which
 
07:13:08.030 --> 07:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
include land owners who manage their
 
07:13:10.628 --> 07:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
Timber lands and contractors developing
 
07:13:12.868 --> 07:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
land we operate all over the state of
 
07:13:15.548 --> 07:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire biomass and lowgrade wood
 
07:13:18.150 --> 07:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
is a byproduct that cannot be avoided
 
07:13:20.070 --> 07:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
harvesting low grade is very important
 
07:13:21.868 --> 07:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
to the health growth and management of
 
07:13:24.350 --> 07:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
our Timber and our Timberlands with the
 
07:13:26.510 --> 07:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
everchanging markets across the board it
 
07:13:28.868 --> 07:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
is already challenging with the limited
 
07:13:30.788 --> 07:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
options we have lost so many mills over
 
07:13:33.510 --> 07:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
the Last 5 Years it's important to keep
 
07:13:35.510 --> 07:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
this biomass plants that we have now
 
07:13:38.030 --> 07:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
operating the economic impact is
 
07:13:38.040 --> 07:13:39.030 align:start position:0%
operating the economic impact is
far-reaching

07:13:39.030 --> 07:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
far-reaching
 
07:13:41.468 --> 07:13:41.478 align:start position:0%
biomass and other low-grade wood is a
 
07:13:44.468 --> 07:13:44.478 align:start position:0%
valuable and reliable energy resource
 
07:13:46.230 --> 07:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
that goes further than you could ever
 
07:13:49.468 --> 07:13:49.478 align:start position:0%
imagine in closing to just save few
 
07:13:51.388 --> 07:13:51.398 align:start position:0%
Pennies on a utility bill it would
 
07:13:53.110 --> 07:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
instead be losing Millions for the New
 
07:13:53.120 --> 07:13:54.110 align:start position:0%
instead be losing Millions for the New

07:13:58.990 --> 07:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 219 and the future bill of
 
07:13:59.000 --> 07:14:01.468 align:start position:0%
House Bill 219 and the future bill of
567

07:14:01.468 --> 07:14:01.478 align:start position:0%
567
 
07:14:04.910 --> 07:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much seeing no
 
07:14:08.030 --> 07:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
questions I would like to call next on
 
07:14:09.590 --> 07:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
Chris Elms of the New Hampshire
 
07:14:12.510 --> 07:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
Department of energy Mr Helms Mr Elms
 
07:14:15.190 --> 07:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
said that he would not testify on this
 
07:14:17.150 --> 07:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
bill but would make himself available
 
07:14:17.160 --> 07:14:18.270 align:start position:0%
bill but would make himself available
for

07:14:18.270 --> 07:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:14:20.788 --> 07:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
questions and I do have a question for
 
07:14:22.868 --> 07:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
you sure uh yeah for the record Deputy
 
07:14:24.830 --> 07:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Chris Elms of the New
 
07:14:26.948 --> 07:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy so thank
 
07:14:31.548 --> 07:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
you so we've been here now for gosh two
 
07:14:34.230 --> 07:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
two and a half hours uh And We Have
 
07:14:38.070 --> 07:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
Heard lots of testimony from the wood
 
07:14:40.750 --> 07:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
industry and lots of testimony from the
 
07:14:40.760 --> 07:14:41.990 align:start position:0%
industry and lots of testimony from the
hydro

07:14:41.990 --> 07:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
hydro
 
07:14:45.150 --> 07:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
industry so my question for you is is
 
07:14:48.510 --> 07:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
there any way for you the department to
 
07:14:50.910 --> 07:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
estimate since we're looking for ways to
 
07:14:53.510 --> 07:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
save to reduce costs for New Hampshire
 
07:14:56.788 --> 07:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
rate payers is there any way for you to
 
07:14:59.150 --> 07:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
estimate what the effect would be to
 
07:15:02.590 --> 07:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
remove class two from the
 
07:15:05.468 --> 07:15:05.478 align:start position:0%
RPS remove class
 
07:15:09.310 --> 07:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
one thermal and put it in class three
 
07:15:12.830 --> 07:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
and then remove class one from the RPS
 
07:15:15.350 --> 07:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
so that the RPS would now be class three
 
07:15:18.468 --> 07:15:18.478 align:start position:0%
and class 4 Wood and hydro is there any
 
07:15:21.310 --> 07:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
way you could either estimate the impact
 
07:15:24.948 --> 07:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
of that or get back to
 
07:15:27.948 --> 07:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
us I will take the latter option I think
 
07:15:30.708 --> 07:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh it it would be difficult to do that
 
07:15:32.990 --> 07:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
as we might be able to provide some
 
07:15:36.150 --> 07:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
analysis on a variety of aspects uh of
 
07:15:36.160 --> 07:15:37.190 align:start position:0%
analysis on a variety of aspects uh of
that

07:15:37.190 --> 07:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:15:39.270 --> 07:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
question excellent thank you does
 
07:15:42.868 --> 07:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:46.070 --> 07:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
Department okay did you have one
 
07:15:49.468 --> 07:15:49.478 align:start position:0%
representative rolds I guess well I
 
07:15:52.628 --> 07:15:52.638 align:start position:0%
guess I'll try to make it a question
 
07:15:54.948 --> 07:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
will it be possible while you're doing
 
07:15:56.948 --> 07:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
that analysis that the chairman just
 
07:15:58.708 --> 07:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
asked for you
 
07:16:02.830 --> 07:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
to uh include the
 
07:16:08.990 --> 07:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:12.310 --> 07:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
um businesses
 
07:16:14.708 --> 07:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities school
 
07:16:18.948 --> 07:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
districts across the state who
 
07:16:18.958 --> 07:16:20.788 align:start position:0%
districts across the state who
have

07:16:20.788 --> 07:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:16:23.590 --> 07:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
installed either solar or we don't have
 
07:16:24.948 --> 07:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
much in the way
 
07:16:28.030 --> 07:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
of we don't have any really building so
 
07:16:30.430 --> 07:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
I guess it would be solar projects you
 
07:16:32.708 --> 07:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
know at businesses at their schools
 
07:16:36.510 --> 07:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
whatever so are relying on you know that
 
07:16:40.110 --> 07:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
are relying on income from the their
 
07:16:41.590 --> 07:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
sale of their renewable energy
 
07:16:43.030 --> 07:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
certificates I feel like it would be
 
07:16:44.670 --> 07:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
important for this committee to
 
07:16:47.590 --> 07:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
understand that potential impact sure
 
07:16:49.830 --> 07:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
and I would say on that uh you know both
 
07:16:52.190 --> 07:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
the questions of cost and benefit are
 
07:16:54.468 --> 07:16:54.478 align:start position:0%
are you know difficult analyses to do
 
07:16:56.230 --> 07:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
especially in the specific context of
 
07:16:58.270 --> 07:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire renewable portfolio
 
07:17:01.670 --> 07:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
standard uh you know when you look at
 
07:17:05.830 --> 07:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
what uh there has been uh to incent the
 
07:17:07.628 --> 07:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
change in the resource mix that we've
 
07:17:10.190 --> 07:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
seen really just since the Advent of the
 
07:17:11.948 --> 07:17:11.958 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard obviously
 
07:17:14.510 --> 07:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a major shift from uh you
 
07:17:16.868 --> 07:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
know oil and coal to Natural Gas doing
 
07:17:18.910 --> 07:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
large part to the economics of natural
 
07:17:22.388 --> 07:17:22.398 align:start position:0%
gas uh we've seen a tremendous amount of
 
07:17:24.628 --> 07:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
incentive and subsidy at the federal
 
07:17:27.670 --> 07:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
state Regional level uh through uh both
 
07:17:30.628 --> 07:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
tax credits and other programming um
 
07:17:32.270 --> 07:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
those those benefits that we talked
 
07:17:34.548 --> 07:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
about right there are potential uh
 
07:17:36.670 --> 07:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
energy benefits reliability benefits and
 
07:17:38.868 --> 07:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
then obviously we heard a lot about non
 
07:17:40.628 --> 07:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
energy benefits that the New Hampshire
 
07:17:42.350 --> 07:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
RPS specifically you know proponents
 
07:17:43.708 --> 07:17:43.718 align:start position:0%
have talked about today whether it's
 
07:17:46.030 --> 07:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
Timber or agriculture I'm I've made a
 
07:17:48.310 --> 07:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
whole list dams water quality Public
 
07:17:49.788 --> 07:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
Health whatever it is that's not
 
07:17:50.830 --> 07:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
something I'm going to be able to
 
07:17:53.788 --> 07:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
include in whatever analysis we have and
 
07:17:55.788 --> 07:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
that's not something we would uh you
 
07:17:58.030 --> 07:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
know look to assess uh and then even on
 
07:17:59.910 --> 07:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
the cost side you know to the extent
 
07:18:01.388 --> 07:18:01.398 align:start position:0%
that you know we talked about in our
 
07:18:02.990 --> 07:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
presentation and I'll keep this quick
 
07:18:06.590 --> 07:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chairman um you know uh the
 
07:18:09.388 --> 07:18:09.398 align:start position:0%
some of the the market effects of out of
 
07:18:10.590 --> 07:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
Market spending and the price
 
07:18:13.708 --> 07:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
suppression effects that lead to uh
 
07:18:17.468 --> 07:18:17.478 align:start position:0%
maybe perhaps undue retirements from uh
 
07:18:20.230 --> 07:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
non uh subsidized resources or resources
 
07:18:22.830 --> 07:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
that don't receive out of Market um you
 
07:18:25.830 --> 07:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
know how do you parse out how much cost
 
07:18:27.708 --> 07:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
should be responsible for the renewable
 
07:18:29.430 --> 07:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard for the costs of say
 
07:18:30.830 --> 07:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
the keeping the Mystic generating
 
07:18:34.388 --> 07:18:34.398 align:start position:0%
station online and the $450 $460 million
 
07:18:36.830 --> 07:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
we spent uh just to keep that online
 
07:18:40.190 --> 07:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
right so uh I can go back and look for
 
07:18:42.510 --> 07:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
both the cost and the benefit uh
 
07:18:44.070 --> 07:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
analysis I'm not promising you I'm going
 
07:18:45.430 --> 07:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
to give you something that's going to
 
07:18:47.670 --> 07:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
give you a whole lot of
 
07:18:47.680 --> 07:18:49.388 align:start position:0%
give you a whole lot of
specifics

07:18:49.388 --> 07:18:49.398 align:start position:0%
specifics
 
07:18:51.590 --> 07:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
followup yeah that was a long answer to
 
07:18:54.548 --> 07:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
my uh question which was uh I didn't ask
 
07:18:56.468 --> 07:18:56.478 align:start position:0%
you to do a cost benefit analysis I
 
07:18:58.190 --> 07:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
asked you to if you could do an
 
07:19:03.150 --> 07:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:06.670 --> 07:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue that school districts
 
07:19:09.510 --> 07:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal other and businesses private
 
07:19:12.548 --> 07:19:12.558 align:start position:0%
businesses in this state uh would be
 
07:19:17.510 --> 07:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
losing uh if we eliminate uh the RPS so
 
07:19:19.868 --> 07:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
they have been getting selling their
 
07:19:22.030 --> 07:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
wrecks into the wreck market and if we
 
07:19:23.510 --> 07:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate it there'll be a loss of
 
07:19:24.670 --> 07:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue so I just want to make sure
 
07:19:24.680 --> 07:19:25.510 align:start position:0%
Revenue so I just want to make sure
we're

07:19:25.510 --> 07:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're
 
07:19:28.190 --> 07:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
accounting for that because loss of
 
07:19:29.708 --> 07:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream to school districts
 
07:19:29.718 --> 07:19:31.150 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream to school districts
municipalities

07:19:31.150 --> 07:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
07:19:34.948 --> 07:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
counties would be uh loss of Revenue to
 
07:19:36.150 --> 07:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
them which would have to be made up
 
07:19:37.910 --> 07:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
through property taxes so I just want to
 
07:19:39.990 --> 07:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
make sure we understand what that is
 
07:19:41.788 --> 07:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
yeah and apologies and sorry for the
 
07:19:43.230 --> 07:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
long answer because I think it was
 
07:19:44.750 --> 07:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
getting to a point that maybe I didn't
 
07:19:47.270 --> 07:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
make clear there but when you look at
 
07:19:50.430 --> 07:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
what goes to incent say a private
 
07:19:52.310 --> 07:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
business a municipality uh from
 
07:19:53.990 --> 07:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
participating in distribute generation
 
07:19:56.788 --> 07:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
in renewable energy whatever it is uh
 
07:19:58.708 --> 07:19:58.718 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of factors so how much
 
07:20:01.270 --> 07:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
of a a project that might receive tax
 
07:20:02.708 --> 07:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
credits that might receive other state
 
07:20:04.510 --> 07:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
subsidies that might receive a grant
 
07:20:06.070 --> 07:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
that also then gets some gets to
 
07:20:07.910 --> 07:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
participate in the wreck market and to
 
07:20:09.350 --> 07:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
the extent that the New Hampshire wreck
 
07:20:11.670 --> 07:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
Market impacts you know New England as a
 
07:20:14.468 --> 07:20:14.478 align:start position:0%
whole you know I we heard testimony that
 
07:20:17.190 --> 07:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
the RPS in New Hampshire is modest it is
 
07:20:19.150 --> 07:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
modest compared to the spending that
 
07:20:21.830 --> 07:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
you'd see in other states in New England
 
07:20:24.190 --> 07:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know in Massachusetts the last
 
07:20:27.510 --> 07:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
time I the last numbers I saw from their
 
07:20:29.590 --> 07:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
variety of clean energy standards their
 
07:20:31.310 --> 07:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
their estimate this was 20 22 was
 
07:20:33.468 --> 07:20:33.478 align:start position:0%
between a billion And1 a. half billion
 
07:20:36.270 --> 07:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
dollar a year and so when you look at
 
07:20:38.868 --> 07:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
our total costs approaching 600 million
 
07:20:40.788 --> 07:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
dollars it sounds like a lot but you
 
07:20:42.590 --> 07:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
look at what Massachusetts is spending
 
07:20:45.590 --> 07:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot there so there is a
 
07:20:48.110 --> 07:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
degree to which some uh folks are going
 
07:20:50.270 --> 07:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
to see major changes to the market and
 
07:20:51.948 --> 07:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
and and uh if New Hampshire is one of
 
07:20:53.788 --> 07:20:53.798 align:start position:0%
the only states that they can sell their
 
07:20:56.670 --> 07:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
Rex in uh other resources are not going
 
07:20:58.270 --> 07:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
to see major change because we just
 
07:20:59.868 --> 07:20:59.878 align:start position:0%
simply aren't as big of a part of the
 
07:21:02.990 --> 07:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:05.350 --> 07:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay thanks for that question uh
 
07:21:07.708 --> 07:21:07.718 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has one thank you
 
07:21:09.628 --> 07:21:09.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Elms for
 
07:21:12.110 --> 07:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my question is now
 
07:21:14.830 --> 07:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
we're sort of picking again which pieces
 
07:21:17.628 --> 07:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
of the RPS we may be able to get rid of
 
07:21:20.990 --> 07:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
and we said class two which is solar so
 
07:21:24.510 --> 07:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
my question is are we accounting
 
07:21:24.520 --> 07:21:26.670 align:start position:0%
my question is are we accounting
for

07:21:26.670 --> 07:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:21:29.830 --> 07:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh are we accounting for any goals in
 
07:21:32.750 --> 07:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
terms of man side right the like the
 
07:21:36.270 --> 07:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
value of having people generating energy
 
07:21:38.788 --> 07:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
where they are rather than importing it
 
07:21:42.030 --> 07:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
um for quite a while the the office of
 
07:21:45.190 --> 07:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
energy planning had uh 10year strategy
 
07:21:48.788 --> 07:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
plans that listed uh demand side efforts
 
07:21:52.948 --> 07:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency um and uh you know
 
07:21:54.670 --> 07:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
generating more energy than you need so
 
07:21:56.030 --> 07:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
that it gets used by the person right
 
07:21:58.548 --> 07:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
next door to you do you have any
 
07:22:00.070 --> 07:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
Assessments in the department of energy
 
07:22:01.708 --> 07:22:01.718 align:start position:0%
about the value of that because I think
 
07:22:03.750 --> 07:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
what we heard here today from folks in
 
07:22:06.548 --> 07:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
other classes is the down Downstream
 
07:22:10.590 --> 07:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
benefits for New Hampshire um of the
 
07:22:13.070 --> 07:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
other aspects of resources in New
 
07:22:14.830 --> 07:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that they take care of as a
 
07:22:16.708 --> 07:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
byproduct of the work that they're doing
 
07:22:19.468 --> 07:22:19.478 align:start position:0%
either with Hydro or with with biomass
 
07:22:22.230 --> 07:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
so is there any such information around
 
07:22:22.240 --> 07:22:23.750 align:start position:0%
so is there any such information around
solar

07:22:23.750 --> 07:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
solar
 
07:22:26.750 --> 07:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
adoption so uh there thank you for the
 
07:22:28.430 --> 07:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
question it was a good question always
 
07:22:31.788 --> 07:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
long no uh and and I'll just to the to
 
07:22:34.948 --> 07:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
the second part first um you know there
 
07:22:37.670 --> 07:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
are a variety of analyses that we do and
 
07:22:38.910 --> 07:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
have you know our tene state energy
 
07:22:40.830 --> 07:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
strategy does talk you mentioned demand
 
07:22:43.670 --> 07:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
side resources does discuss sort of uh
 
07:22:45.708 --> 07:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
you know those resources and where they
 
07:22:48.190 --> 07:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
fit into our mix and obviously you know
 
07:22:50.030 --> 07:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
in a variety of proceedings at the Pu
 
07:22:51.430 --> 07:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
we've talked about you know the value of
 
07:22:53.788 --> 07:22:53.798 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources and uh
 
07:22:56.030 --> 07:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
among other things uh I'm just going to
 
07:22:57.590 --> 07:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know point out and I apologize for
 
07:22:59.670 --> 07:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
not giving you the upfront uh a little
 
07:23:01.510 --> 07:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
Preamble here this you know we're
 
07:23:03.788 --> 07:23:03.798 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill um the goals
 
07:23:06.468 --> 07:23:06.478 align:start position:0%
associated with the RPS are are those
 
07:23:09.110 --> 07:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that are listed in 362 F right uh in
 
07:23:11.030 --> 07:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
section one there and and you heard from
 
07:23:13.230 --> 07:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
folks on those uh the Department's role
 
07:23:15.590 --> 07:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
here is to implement what essentially
 
07:23:18.510 --> 07:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature has been pretty clear uh
 
07:23:20.350 --> 07:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
are the are the goals and requirements
 
07:23:23.270 --> 07:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that those goals change
 
07:23:25.430 --> 07:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
and if that's that's our reading of what
 
07:23:28.708 --> 07:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
this this bill uh is is indicating right
 
07:23:30.190 --> 07:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
we will implement it to the best of our
 
07:23:30.200 --> 07:23:33.270 align:start position:0%
we will implement it to the best of our
ability

07:23:33.270 --> 07:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:36.230 --> 07:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so the I guess the
 
07:23:38.070 --> 07:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
heart of the question is that we're
 
07:23:40.868 --> 07:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
talking on this committee solely about
 
07:23:42.468 --> 07:23:42.478 align:start position:0%
cost to the rate payer and trying to
 
07:23:45.750 --> 07:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
find savings for the rate payer so does
 
07:23:47.430 --> 07:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
the department of energy have any
 
07:23:50.510 --> 07:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
information that can give us a sense of
 
07:23:53.948 --> 07:23:53.958 align:start position:0%
whether or not the adoption of solar in
 
07:23:55.670 --> 07:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is actually a
 
07:23:58.948 --> 07:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:01.350 --> 07:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
payers in the the context of the
 
07:24:04.110 --> 07:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard or or just
 
07:24:06.868 --> 07:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
in general in the in the context that we
 
07:24:10.030 --> 07:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
have today which is with the with the
 
07:24:10.040 --> 07:24:11.708 align:start position:0%
have today which is with the with the
RPS

07:24:11.708 --> 07:24:11.718 align:start position:0%
RPS
 
07:24:14.070 --> 07:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
included what we would be looking at is
 
07:24:17.750 --> 07:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
is an economic uh net benefit to people
 
07:24:20.030 --> 07:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
adopting uh solar in the state of New
 
07:24:22.590 --> 07:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that you know means we don't
 
07:24:24.030 --> 07:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
have to
 
07:24:27.868 --> 07:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
import so if you look at um if you look
 
07:24:30.510 --> 07:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
at the net metering proceeding that uh
 
07:24:32.030 --> 07:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
went forward at the at the Public
 
07:24:34.270 --> 07:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and is ongoing the
 
07:24:36.070 --> 07:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
department uh you know we had a position
 
07:24:38.948 --> 07:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
in that docket uh and and we argued for
 
07:24:41.270 --> 07:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
a status quo uh on the compensation
 
07:24:43.190 --> 07:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
levels for distributed energy resources
 
07:24:46.708 --> 07:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
there um to the extent that you know uh
 
07:24:50.190 --> 07:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits are a value you
 
07:24:53.270 --> 07:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
know I think I think as you've heard a
 
07:24:55.270 --> 07:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
lot of the concern that folks have
 
07:24:58.548 --> 07:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
expressed are those non-energy benefits
 
07:25:01.350 --> 07:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
that go beyond obviously this the the N
 
07:25:02.830 --> 07:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
metering being designed as Fair
 
07:25:05.628 --> 07:25:05.638 align:start position:0%
compensation rather than a subsidy um
 
07:25:07.830 --> 07:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
what what you're seeing here are a lot
 
07:25:10.230 --> 07:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
of uh folks talking about benefits that
 
07:25:13.830 --> 07:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
might exist beyond beyond those uh sort
 
07:25:17.468 --> 07:25:17.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:20.430 --> 07:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
benefits representative Swanson has a
 
07:25:22.990 --> 07:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
07:25:26.830 --> 07:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
Elms uh probably to uh see if I can
 
07:25:28.150 --> 07:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
break this down in Fairly
 
07:25:29.708 --> 07:25:29.718 align:start position:0%
straightforward terms there was a
 
07:25:31.430 --> 07:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
mention earlier about like
 
07:25:34.308 --> 07:25:34.318 align:start position:0%
$1.98 a month it costs the average rate
 
07:25:37.590 --> 07:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
payer let's round that to $2 a month and
 
07:25:39.708 --> 07:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
there it's probably in here oh I'll
 
07:25:41.190 --> 07:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
sorry I'll let you finish your question
 
07:25:44.110 --> 07:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
I I do want to just sort of note on that
 
07:25:46.670 --> 07:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think what we see here
 
07:25:49.628 --> 07:25:49.638 align:start position:0%
in the RAF report is a sort of a per
 
07:25:52.430 --> 07:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour average and I think that's
 
07:25:54.190 --> 07:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
I I'd have to go back and check with uh
 
07:25:55.468 --> 07:25:55.478 align:start position:0%
with the smart folks but I think that's
 
07:25:58.270 --> 07:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
done by essentially taking the you know
 
07:26:01.388 --> 07:26:01.398 align:start position:0%
uh total total like cost and kilowatt
 
07:26:03.388 --> 07:26:03.398 align:start position:0%
hour sales uh but when you break it down
 
07:26:05.548 --> 07:26:05.558 align:start position:0%
by customer class I think if you look at
 
07:26:07.708 --> 07:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
the the recent default Service uh
 
07:26:11.628 --> 07:26:11.638 align:start position:0%
filings in uni till it's about 8 cents
 
07:26:13.708 --> 07:26:13.718 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me 8/10 of a cent uh per
 
07:26:17.030 --> 07:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour uh 0.9 uh for Liberty and
 
07:26:19.750 --> 07:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
eversource that gets you to about $70 a
 
07:26:22.788 --> 07:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
year uh $5 a month $60 to
 
07:26:25.990 --> 07:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
$70 for average residential repair okay
 
07:26:28.510 --> 07:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
so say it's $10 a
 
07:26:32.510 --> 07:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
month okay just if you can you break
 
07:26:34.590 --> 07:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
down and it may be somewhere here but I
 
07:26:37.030 --> 07:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't recall off the top of my head so
 
07:26:39.548 --> 07:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
there are class one two three and four
 
07:26:39.558 --> 07:26:40.628 align:start position:0%
there are class one two three and four
recks

07:26:40.628 --> 07:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
recks
 
07:26:45.308 --> 07:26:45.318 align:start position:0%
right okay so of say it was $10 a month
 
07:26:47.750 --> 07:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
how many dollars to class one how many
 
07:26:49.948 --> 07:26:49.958 align:start position:0%
to class two how many to class three and
 
07:26:52.948 --> 07:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
how many class four would come back to
 
07:26:54.948 --> 07:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
the rate
 
07:26:58.430 --> 07:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
payer it's a good question uh so uh in
 
07:27:00.910 --> 07:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
the uh RF annual report that we file
 
07:27:02.910 --> 07:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
with this committee uh we filed it in
 
07:27:06.430 --> 07:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
November of 2024 we do break down the
 
07:27:08.868 --> 07:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
ACP revenues the alternative compliance
 
07:27:12.388 --> 07:27:12.398 align:start position:0%
payment revenues uh by class and those
 
07:27:13.590 --> 07:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
say essentially what we're taking in
 
07:27:18.030 --> 07:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
from acps uh we don't break them down by
 
07:27:22.548 --> 07:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
um by the uh total RPS costs uh in the
 
07:27:24.830 --> 07:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
RF report I will check in with folks to
 
07:27:27.230 --> 07:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
see to what extent we can do that or
 
07:27:28.750 --> 07:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
would share that you know obviously the
 
07:27:30.750 --> 07:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
RPS markets are
 
07:27:33.628 --> 07:27:33.638 align:start position:0%
um you know Market sensitive and and so
 
07:27:35.750 --> 07:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
there that might play into it but uh I
 
07:27:37.230 --> 07:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
can try to get that information for you
 
07:27:39.150 --> 07:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr El thank you Mr
 
07:27:42.190 --> 07:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
chair okay thank you and seeing no more
 
07:27:46.150 --> 07:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
questions we'll give the uh baton to
 
07:27:49.230 --> 07:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
John Gage for the last word on House
 
07:28:00.270 --> 07:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:02.510 --> 07:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman and committee
 
07:28:06.430 --> 07:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
um J Gage and I oppose this bill uh I
 
07:28:09.628 --> 07:28:09.638 align:start position:0%
think energy diversity is key uh to
 
07:28:12.468 --> 07:28:12.478 align:start position:0%
energy Independence and markets don't
 
07:28:14.670 --> 07:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
operate 100% efficiently all by
 
07:28:17.788 --> 07:28:17.798 align:start position:0%
themselves they need some help um New
 
07:28:19.270 --> 07:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is kind of known as the dnut
 
07:28:21.190 --> 07:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
hole of Energy Efficiency and clean
 
07:28:24.230 --> 07:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
energy in the Northeast um I was just
 
07:28:28.070 --> 07:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
looking up the RPS percentages of other
 
07:28:31.788 --> 07:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
surrounding states main is 80% by 2030
 
07:28:36.308 --> 07:28:36.318 align:start position:0%
Vermont 63% in 2025 Massachusetts 40% in
 
07:28:39.830 --> 07:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
2030 Connecticut 48% in 2030 Rhode
 
07:28:43.388 --> 07:28:43.398 align:start position:0%
Island 100% in 33 and New Hampshire is
 
07:28:46.990 --> 07:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
still 25% possibly zero in
 
07:28:47.000 --> 07:28:48.990 align:start position:0%
still 25% possibly zero in
2025

07:28:48.990 --> 07:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
2025
 
07:28:49.000 --> 07:28:50.670 align:start position:0%
2025
um

07:28:50.670 --> 07:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:54.388 --> 07:28:54.398 align:start position:0%
we the energy Market does require
 
07:28:58.628 --> 07:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:02.990 --> 07:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
um other states are increasing their
 
07:29:06.788 --> 07:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
rpss and we may lose one the problem
 
07:29:09.030 --> 07:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
here is the this we're sending a signal
 
07:29:11.510 --> 07:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
to the market that New Hampshire is
 
07:29:14.468 --> 07:29:14.478 align:start position:0%
unstable and we heard a lot of concern
 
07:29:18.750 --> 07:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
from um from wood and and water power
 
07:29:20.948 --> 07:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
suppliers about the impacts this would
 
07:29:22.670 --> 07:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
cause on their businesses this is not a
 
07:29:25.388 --> 07:29:25.398 align:start position:0%
good signal to send to businesses in New
 
07:29:28.388 --> 07:29:28.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um representative Harrington
 
07:29:30.150 --> 07:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
noted that if people want Renewables
 
07:29:31.868 --> 07:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
energy they can choose it uh we don't
 
07:29:35.150 --> 07:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
need to subsidize it um rap pairs are
 
07:29:35.160 --> 07:29:35.910 align:start position:0%
need to subsidize it um rap pairs are
not

07:29:35.910 --> 07:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:29:38.788 --> 07:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
stupid um rate pairs are participants in
 
07:29:42.430 --> 07:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
a market that currently is experiencing
 
07:29:44.350 --> 07:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
the largest market failure in the
 
07:29:47.150 --> 07:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
history of humankind the US government
 
07:29:49.190 --> 07:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
released a report last year that
 
07:29:51.070 --> 07:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
estimated the cost of pollution from
 
07:29:54.948 --> 07:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels to the US is $600 billion a
 
07:29:57.548 --> 07:29:57.558 align:start position:0%
year um this is a subsidy we're giving
 
07:30:00.990 --> 07:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
to the fossil fuel industry um
 
07:30:03.868 --> 07:30:03.878 align:start position:0%
and I mentioned before the the heavy
 
07:30:07.468 --> 07:30:07.478 align:start position:0%
thumb of Alec but it's also other front
 
07:30:09.230 --> 07:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
group organizations that the coch
 
07:30:12.628 --> 07:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
network billionaires pay uh to influence
 
07:30:14.910 --> 07:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
policies because they know policies
 
07:30:20.030 --> 07:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:23.070 --> 07:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
choices someone said I sacrificed the
 
07:30:25.468 --> 07:30:25.478 align:start position:0%
DAT to come here and testify uh because
 
07:30:26.350 --> 07:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
I'm so
 
07:30:28.510 --> 07:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
concerned well I started reading climate
 
07:30:30.350 --> 07:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
science 10 years ago and I left my
 
07:30:33.110 --> 07:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
full-time job at Oracle 6 years ago and
 
07:30:35.350 --> 07:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
I've sacrificed six years of a full-time
 
07:30:38.308 --> 07:30:38.318 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits because I'm alarmed
 
07:30:40.788 --> 07:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
at our government's in action to address
 
07:30:43.910 --> 07:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
climate pollution from fossil fuels RPS
 
07:30:45.830 --> 07:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
is not all we need to do we need a
 
07:30:48.468 --> 07:30:48.478 align:start position:0%
fredal price on pollution a carbon price
 
07:30:51.510 --> 07:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
on fossil fuels but the RPS is a good
 
07:30:53.948 --> 07:30:53.958 align:start position:0%
thing for New Hampshire for a diverse
 
07:30:57.510 --> 07:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
energy source on local jobs so I oppose
 
07:31:02.150 --> 07:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:04.990 --> 07:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you having no other pink
 
07:31:07.388 --> 07:31:07.398 align:start position:0%
cards I think we're done so I'm going to
 
07:31:09.308 --> 07:31:09.318 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
07:31:12.868 --> 07:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
219 FN and open the public hearing on
 
07:31:16.548 --> 07:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
House Bill 567 FN and since
 
07:31:19.590 --> 07:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has left due
 
07:31:22.468 --> 07:31:22.478 align:start position:0%
to a prior con uh commitment
 
07:31:25.030 --> 07:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative JD bernardy will
 
07:31:30.190 --> 07:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 567 to the committee so
 
07:31:30.200 --> 07:31:52.910 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 567 to the committee so
representative

07:31:52.910 --> 07:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:55.190 --> 07:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chairman JD
 
07:31:58.350 --> 07:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
Bernardi for the record Rockingham 36 I
 
07:32:00.990 --> 07:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
am not a co-sponsor of this bill but I
 
07:32:03.030 --> 07:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
am introducing it for representative
 
07:32:05.830 --> 07:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington because he is not here I will
 
07:32:08.590 --> 07:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
point out as I understand the bill it
 
07:32:12.430 --> 07:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
does essentially one major thing which
 
07:32:16.110 --> 07:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
is to remove thermal wrecks from all the
 
07:32:21.510 --> 07:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
RPS system such that the only thing that
 
07:32:26.430 --> 07:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
RPS uh reck will be available for are
 
07:32:30.430 --> 07:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
production of electricity if if it if
 
07:32:33.150 --> 07:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
the wreck is being used to produce uh
 
07:32:37.070 --> 07:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
thermal energy that's not electric
 
07:32:42.030 --> 07:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
generating then it's uh the the wreck is
 
07:32:45.628 --> 07:32:45.638 align:start position:0%
to be removed uh it also looks at the
 
07:32:50.190 --> 07:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
the uh the table that defines what the
 
07:32:52.750 --> 07:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
wreck values for the various classes are
 
07:32:55.868 --> 07:32:55.878 align:start position:0%
going to be in
 
07:33:00.308 --> 07:33:00.318 align:start position:0%
2025 and Beyond and it it
 
07:33:00.318 --> 07:33:01.468 align:start position:0%
2025 and Beyond and it it
uh

07:33:01.468 --> 07:33:01.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:33:04.708 --> 07:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
puts uh changed final numbers there
 
07:33:08.270 --> 07:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
class one being 6% class two being
 
07:33:10.910 --> 07:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
0.003% class three
 
07:33:19.070 --> 07:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:21.628 --> 07:33:21.638 align:start position:0%
1.5% and that's my understanding of the
 
07:33:23.670 --> 07:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
bill okay and you're not taking any
 
07:33:25.868 --> 07:33:25.878 align:start position:0%
question you're not involved with it
 
07:33:28.670 --> 07:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
right okay I get it so next up is
 
07:33:38.548 --> 07:33:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:43.708 --> 07:33:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:46.350 --> 07:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
07:33:48.190 --> 07:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for all hanging in there all
 
07:33:51.110 --> 07:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
day um my name is Lori coren I do
 
07:33:54.190 --> 07:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
represent Coos County 7 which includes
 
07:33:56.590 --> 07:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
Berlin Whitefield Jefferson Kil Kenny
 
07:33:59.830 --> 07:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
and Twin Mountain um there's nothing I
 
07:34:01.270 --> 07:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you that you haven't already
 
07:34:04.990 --> 07:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
heard in the last 3 hours um but this
 
07:34:08.150 --> 07:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
would impact our local economy jobs
 
07:34:09.350 --> 07:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
would be
 
07:34:12.110 --> 07:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
lost um and tax
 
07:34:15.670 --> 07:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
revenue that we desperately need
 
07:34:21.270 --> 07:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
would disappear um I humbly ask that you
 
07:34:25.510 --> 07:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
itl HB 567 thank
 
07:34:28.110 --> 07:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you thank you for hanging
 
07:34:30.670 --> 07:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
in there and have a safe right home
 
07:34:36.388 --> 07:34:36.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:39.190 --> 07:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
lenos thank you Mr chairman members of
 
07:34:41.750 --> 07:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
the committee um I think there's been a
 
07:34:44.150 --> 07:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
bit of a loss of perspective here and I
 
07:34:45.990 --> 07:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give you some numbers I
 
07:34:47.388 --> 07:34:47.398 align:start position:0%
know no one wants to hear numbers late
 
07:34:50.030 --> 07:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
in the day but I think it's important
 
07:34:53.788 --> 07:34:53.798 align:start position:0%
the RPS right now today the full RPS is
 
07:34:58.388 --> 07:34:58.398 align:start position:0%
25% and it plateaus at 25% if you're if
 
07:35:00.548 --> 07:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
current load current consumption in the
 
07:35:03.628 --> 07:35:03.638 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is 10.4 million
 
07:35:08.990 --> 07:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours a year 25% of that is 2.6
 
07:35:11.628 --> 07:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
million megawatt hours that's what we
 
07:35:14.430 --> 07:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
need to meet across all classes class
 
07:35:16.110 --> 07:35:16.120 align:start position:0%
one is the largest at
 
07:35:19.230 --> 07:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
15% and then the others are
 
07:35:23.190 --> 07:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
smaller the when we talk about um the
 
07:35:25.948 --> 07:35:25.958 align:start position:0%
qualified facilities Department of
 
07:35:28.308 --> 07:35:28.318 align:start position:0%
energy maintains a list of the qualified
 
07:35:30.110 --> 07:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that are class one Class 2
 
07:35:31.910 --> 07:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
class three class 4 and Class one
 
07:35:35.070 --> 07:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
thermal and there are almost 8,000
 
07:35:37.830 --> 07:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
facilities the vast majority of them are
 
07:35:40.628 --> 07:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
small kilowatt scale solar okay so then
 
07:35:42.788 --> 07:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
they're a handful of others many of
 
07:35:44.388 --> 07:35:44.398 align:start position:0%
those are not existing in the state of
 
07:35:46.830 --> 07:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire many of the projects that
 
07:35:48.708 --> 07:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
are built the wind projects were not
 
07:35:50.708 --> 07:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
built because of New Hampshire's RPS
 
07:35:52.868 --> 07:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
they were built because of rpss in other
 
07:35:54.750 --> 07:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
states that's where the energy is being
 
07:35:57.910 --> 07:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
sold that's where their wrecks are being
 
07:35:59.830 --> 07:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
potentially settled as opposed to being
 
07:36:01.830 --> 07:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
settled here it's a very very important
 
07:36:04.270 --> 07:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
point because I'm going to get to class
 
07:36:06.510 --> 07:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
one thermal now um but I wanted to make
 
07:36:09.750 --> 07:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
the point that a lot of claims that
 
07:36:11.510 --> 07:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose all sorts of money
 
07:36:13.350 --> 07:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire's going to collapse
 
07:36:14.670 --> 07:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to have diversity of
 
07:36:17.468 --> 07:36:17.478 align:start position:0%
fuel it's not because so much because of
 
07:36:20.548 --> 07:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's RPS now talk about class
 
07:36:23.670 --> 07:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
one thermal for years now since class
 
07:36:26.990 --> 07:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
one thermal was put into effect in 2013
 
07:36:28.910 --> 07:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
we have been told that it was going to
 
07:36:30.670 --> 07:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
grow in were going to be all sorts of
 
07:36:33.110 --> 07:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity every year since
 
07:36:37.430 --> 07:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
2013 that that resource has never even
 
07:36:40.510 --> 07:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
come close to meeting its mandate right
 
07:36:43.430 --> 07:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
now its mandate is
 
07:36:46.948 --> 07:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
2.2% as part of the two 10.4 million
 
07:36:49.910 --> 07:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour load is coming in at less
 
07:36:53.388 --> 07:36:53.398 align:start position:0%
than 1% every year it's come in at less
 
07:36:53.398 --> 07:36:54.190 align:start position:0%
than 1% every year it's come in at less
than

07:36:54.190 --> 07:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
than
 
07:36:57.110 --> 07:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
1% and it doesn't even appear I'm
 
07:36:59.150 --> 07:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
looking out wreck numbers a number of
 
07:37:01.548 --> 07:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
wck that have been settled as class one
 
07:37:03.468 --> 07:37:03.478 align:start position:0%
thermal which can only settle in New
 
07:37:06.110 --> 07:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire is the only RPS
 
07:37:08.548 --> 07:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
that supports class 1 thermal when you
 
07:37:11.510 --> 07:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
look at the Rex it doesn't appear that
 
07:37:14.670 --> 07:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
there's been new class one thermal
 
07:37:18.350 --> 07:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
generation or qualification since 2018
 
07:37:20.708 --> 07:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
2019 so it's not exactly
 
07:37:24.388 --> 07:37:24.398 align:start position:0%
growing so we've been promised by Mr
 
07:37:26.350 --> 07:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
nebling and others that class one
 
07:37:27.910 --> 07:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
thermal is very important it's going to
 
07:37:29.150 --> 07:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
make all sorts of money and it keeps
 
07:37:32.070 --> 07:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
business is going and all in all that
 
07:37:34.910 --> 07:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
but as a resource it's not really
 
07:37:37.590 --> 07:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
delivering at all okay so I that's
 
07:37:40.030 --> 07:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
really important so if it disappeared
 
07:37:42.750 --> 07:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
today it might have an effect on in
 
07:37:44.910 --> 07:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
small community of people a small
 
07:37:47.510 --> 07:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
population of people and we could talk
 
07:37:50.030 --> 07:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
about how we can maintain that but um I
 
07:37:51.990 --> 07:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make that now now let's
 
07:37:53.230 --> 07:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
07:37:56.350 --> 07:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
biomass biomass falls into two
 
07:37:58.468 --> 07:37:58.478 align:start position:0%
categories there's class one biomass and
 
07:38:01.350 --> 07:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's class three biomass okay class 3
 
07:38:03.430 --> 07:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
biomass are all facilities that were
 
07:38:06.308 --> 07:38:06.318 align:start position:0%
built prior to 2006 and they are less
 
07:38:09.110 --> 07:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
than 25 megawatts in size those
 
07:38:11.030 --> 07:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
facilities were and most of the if not
 
07:38:12.990 --> 07:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
all the facilities were built decades
 
07:38:15.270 --> 07:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
ago sorry Mr chairman I'll just finish
 
07:38:15.280 --> 07:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
ago sorry Mr chairman I'll just finish
this

07:38:16.070 --> 07:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:38:18.548 --> 07:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
comment they were built decades ago
 
07:38:19.868 --> 07:38:19.878 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
07:38:23.110 --> 07:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining old technology most of which
 
07:38:25.510 --> 07:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
is not even meeting our needs it's
 
07:38:28.308 --> 07:38:28.318 align:start position:0%
barely develop delivering at this point
 
07:38:29.548 --> 07:38:29.558 align:start position:0%
and most of it was going to to
 
07:38:32.110 --> 07:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
Connecticut which was built which was um
 
07:38:35.788 --> 07:38:35.798 align:start position:0%
accepting class 3 um as class one in
 
07:38:38.830 --> 07:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut so it's hard to justify that
 
07:38:38.840 --> 07:38:40.190 align:start position:0%
Connecticut so it's hard to justify that
know

07:38:40.190 --> 07:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:38:43.270 --> 07:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
it just have one more comment comment
 
07:38:45.190 --> 07:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll let it go you had asked the
 
07:38:46.948 --> 07:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
question about whether what can we do
 
07:38:49.510 --> 07:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
can we get rid of class one I have I
 
07:38:51.110 --> 07:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
would like to respond to that I'll
 
07:38:53.590 --> 07:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
respond to that in in writing but the
 
07:38:56.030 --> 07:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
biggest impact would be on Berlin power
 
07:38:59.430 --> 07:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
and possibly shillin Schiller the biomas
 
07:39:01.548 --> 07:39:01.558 align:start position:0%
facility that's class one that will be
 
07:39:03.670 --> 07:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
affected all of the other resources will
 
07:39:06.510 --> 07:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
go someplace else into other parts of
 
07:39:08.388 --> 07:39:08.398 align:start position:0%
the of the region and we'll benefit from
 
07:39:10.430 --> 07:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
that because they exist but we won't pay
 
07:39:14.350 --> 07:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
for it thank you okay thank
 
07:39:17.070 --> 07:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
you so I'm going to call next on Robert
 
07:39:20.830 --> 07:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
con the mayor of Berlin New Hampshire
 
07:39:23.190 --> 07:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
and uh Mr con I know you traveled along
 
07:39:25.190 --> 07:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
long way so I want to hear what you have
 
07:39:27.110 --> 07:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
to say before we shut this down for the
 
07:39:29.548 --> 07:39:29.558 align:start position:0%
day I appreciate it thank you uh
 
07:39:31.308 --> 07:39:31.318 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh committee
 
07:39:34.308 --> 07:39:34.318 align:start position:0%
members for allowing me the time to
 
07:39:36.430 --> 07:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
speak um as you clearly stated my name
 
07:39:38.468 --> 07:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
is Robert Conan I'm the mayor of the
 
07:39:40.070 --> 07:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
city of Berlin New
 
07:39:42.548 --> 07:39:42.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today to oppose House
 
07:39:42.558 --> 07:39:44.708 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today to oppose House
Bill

07:39:44.708 --> 07:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
07:39:49.030 --> 07:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
567 and the proposed House Bill 2025 in
 
07:39:50.388 --> 07:39:50.398 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house
 
07:39:53.708 --> 07:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
bill 567 is aiming to eliminate useful
 
07:39:56.070 --> 07:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
thermal energy from renewable energy
 
07:39:59.070 --> 07:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
classes this could signicantly impact
 
07:40:01.110 --> 07:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
both General economy and specifically
 
07:40:03.708 --> 07:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
low-grade Timber industry in Coos County
 
07:40:05.430 --> 07:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
and especially in the city of Berlin
 
07:40:07.070 --> 07:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
where we're in a very delicate situation
 
07:40:08.548 --> 07:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
with the Burgess
 
07:40:11.230 --> 07:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
biopower Berlin has a notable biomass
 
07:40:13.150 --> 07:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
industry which has been mentioned few
 
07:40:15.030 --> 07:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
times tonight with facilities like the
 
07:40:17.948 --> 07:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
bures biopower Burgess biopower relies
 
07:40:19.990 --> 07:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
on thermal energy conversion for
 
07:40:22.670 --> 07:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
electricity removing thermal energy from
 
07:40:24.670 --> 07:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
renewable energy classes could reduce
 
07:40:26.750 --> 07:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
the economic incentives for maintaining
 
07:40:29.270 --> 07:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
and expanding these facilities leading
 
07:40:31.430 --> 07:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
to less investment and potentially
 
07:40:31.440 --> 07:40:32.910 align:start position:0%
to less investment and potentially
downsizing

07:40:32.910 --> 07:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
downsizing
 
07:40:35.350 --> 07:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
operations which can lead to job losses
 
07:40:38.388 --> 07:40:38.398 align:start position:0%
and creating a downward economic spiral
 
07:40:39.788 --> 07:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
which would come crashing down on the
 
07:40:42.590 --> 07:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
local economy spending local businesses
 
07:40:43.948 --> 07:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
and services
 
07:40:48.110 --> 07:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
provided House Bill 567 would deter new
 
07:40:50.430 --> 07:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects and expanding
 
07:40:52.628 --> 07:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
current projects this bill completely
 
07:40:54.590 --> 07:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
removes class one and class three plants
 
07:40:56.868 --> 07:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
from receiving renewable energy credits
 
07:40:59.468 --> 07:40:59.478 align:start position:0%
from thermal energy it would have a dam
 
07:41:02.150 --> 07:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
ing effect on Burg's biopower Burg's
 
07:41:04.110 --> 07:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
biopower as we all know is anticipated
 
07:41:06.110 --> 07:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
to be coming out of bankruptcy real soon
 
07:41:08.030 --> 07:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
we've been doing a lot of work with them
 
07:41:10.708 --> 07:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
if House Bill 567 is passed it could
 
07:41:12.468 --> 07:41:12.478 align:start position:0%
force them into a liquidation where
 
07:41:13.910 --> 07:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
they're coming out of
 
07:41:16.190 --> 07:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy the city of Berlin cannot
 
07:41:18.150 --> 07:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
afford another closure we have endured
 
07:41:20.110 --> 07:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
two paper mills that had closed and
 
07:41:23.270 --> 07:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
Isaacson structural steel what do that
 
07:41:25.510 --> 07:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
stake for the city if Burgess biopower
 
07:41:27.948 --> 07:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
is forced to close it's insurmountable
 
07:41:30.030 --> 07:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
to think of what that would be for the
 
07:41:31.350 --> 07:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
city and its
 
07:41:33.990 --> 07:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers roughly 20% of Berlin's
 
07:41:36.308 --> 07:41:36.318 align:start position:0%

biomass
 
07:41:40.788 --> 07:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
45% is with the Berlin Waterworks and
 
07:41:44.150 --> 07:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
about 25% from the sewer department is
 
07:41:46.750 --> 07:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
dependent on the Burgess biopower if
 
07:41:49.948 --> 07:41:49.958 align:start position:0%
they fail because of removing them from
 
07:41:52.270 --> 07:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
the class one it directly falls on the
 
07:41:55.308 --> 07:41:55.318 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the in Berlin not only will
 
07:41:57.308 --> 07:41:57.318 align:start position:0%
affect the taxpayers but it will also
 
07:42:00.270 --> 07:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
have an impact on local Energy prices
 
07:42:01.830 --> 07:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
this bill will deal a significant blow
 
07:42:03.628 --> 07:42:03.638 align:start position:0%
to the low-grade Timber industry which
 
07:42:05.628 --> 07:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
we've heard from tonight not only will
 
07:42:06.948 --> 07:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
it hurt the logging industry in the
 
07:42:09.070 --> 07:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
North Country which is a major part of
 
07:42:10.910 --> 07:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
our history in everyday life it will
 
07:42:12.750 --> 07:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
also have a negative effect on forestman
 
07:42:15.190 --> 07:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
management which we've also heard this
 
07:42:18.910 --> 07:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
evening overall House Bill 567 could
 
07:42:20.590 --> 07:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
lean to a damaging impact for the city
 
07:42:23.308 --> 07:42:23.318 align:start position:0%
of Berlin threatening both economic
 
07:42:25.670 --> 07:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
benefits derived from renewable energy
 
07:42:27.830 --> 07:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
and specific market for low-grade Timber
 
07:42:30.670 --> 07:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
which plays a Cru crucial role in local
 
07:42:32.868 --> 07:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
forestry economics job creation and
 
07:42:40.468 --> 07:42:40.478 align:start position:0%

you thank you mayor sorry to keep you
 
07:42:48.830 --> 07:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
waiting so long appreciate you driving
 
07:42:50.708 --> 07:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
all the way down here to talk to us
 
07:42:53.070 --> 07:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely so can you give us
 
07:42:57.270 --> 07:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
a a quick update on how things are with
 
07:43:00.948 --> 07:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
Berlin and Burgess the these days so
 
07:43:02.670 --> 07:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
Berlin we're moving along we haven't
 
07:43:04.430 --> 07:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
quite set the tax rate yet because we
 
07:43:07.788 --> 07:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
had to redo the payment in Lua taxes uh
 
07:43:10.350 --> 07:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
with them which um I believe has been
 
07:43:13.948 --> 07:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
approved by the bankruptcy court which
 
07:43:16.070 --> 07:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to be sting that down to get
 
07:43:19.190 --> 07:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
established um nobody kind of won in
 
07:43:22.430 --> 07:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
that short-term pilot um but that's okay
 
07:43:24.308 --> 07:43:24.318 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll make it up on the long
 
07:43:26.510 --> 07:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
run but things are well we have we're
 
07:43:30.468 --> 07:43:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:34.270 --> 07:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
so as far as you know the plant uh has a
 
07:43:37.628 --> 07:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
a chance to emerge from bankruptcy uh
 
07:43:40.868 --> 07:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
intact yes sir uh they do have a chance
 
07:43:42.708 --> 07:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
to come out out of bankruptcy and it
 
07:43:44.628 --> 07:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
07:43:47.510 --> 07:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
um they're going to do well I mean
 
07:43:49.350 --> 07:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the city has been good
 
07:43:50.948 --> 07:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
they've been in member good standing
 
07:43:52.388 --> 07:43:52.398 align:start position:0%
with the Waterworks paying along the
 
07:43:55.230 --> 07:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
whole way and in the sewer
 
07:43:58.190 --> 07:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
department um but it's a very viable
 
07:44:00.150 --> 07:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
option and think one last thing that
 
07:44:02.788 --> 07:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
might be is they're looking at maybe who
 
07:44:05.150 --> 07:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
might be operating it
 
07:44:07.590 --> 07:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
but they're they've been operating this
 
07:44:10.628 --> 07:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
whole time going through it so and what
 
07:44:12.750 --> 07:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
is the status of the grant that Berlin
 
07:44:14.788 --> 07:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
got from the
 
07:44:18.230 --> 07:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
USDA oh the raise Grant sir yeah the um
 
07:44:20.190 --> 07:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
melt snow on the streets yes yeah the
 
07:44:23.270 --> 07:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
snow melt system uh as of now we're um
 
07:44:25.788 --> 07:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
going through the Engineering Process uh
 
07:44:27.308 --> 07:44:27.318 align:start position:0%
for it and hopefully we're going to
 
07:44:31.430 --> 07:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:34.468 --> 07:44:34.478 align:start position:0%
26 excellent yes anybody else have a
 
07:44:37.388 --> 07:44:37.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:40.110 --> 07:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
mayor seeing none I guess
 
07:44:42.868 --> 07:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
we're representative McGee has one yeah
 
07:44:44.468 --> 07:44:44.478 align:start position:0%
I thank you for taking my question I
 
07:44:47.190 --> 07:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
just like to emphasize or ask you to
 
07:44:49.990 --> 07:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
emphasize it sounds like the economics
 
07:44:51.830 --> 07:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
you've been working really hard on this
 
07:44:53.788 --> 07:44:53.798 align:start position:0%
your local economics and you said you
 
07:44:56.070 --> 07:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
did say it would be devastating and that
 
07:44:58.270 --> 07:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
you can't afford another plant closure
 
07:45:00.270 --> 07:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned couple of other uh
 
07:45:02.430 --> 07:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
large plants that probably were major
 
07:45:04.270 --> 07:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers right for Berlin correct that
 
07:45:08.030 --> 07:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
have closed so um so I guess can you
 
07:45:10.788 --> 07:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
just punctuate that for us in terms of
 
07:45:13.190 --> 07:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
what it would mean if these bills pass
 
07:45:15.468 --> 07:45:15.478 align:start position:0%
and the uh so more or less what it would
 
07:45:17.948 --> 07:45:17.958 align:start position:0%
be I mean I use the word insurmountable
 
07:45:20.510 --> 07:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh yeah in my testimony and that's
 
07:45:22.750 --> 07:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
really what it would be it's about 20%
 
07:45:25.750 --> 07:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the taxes that the Berlin biomass
 
07:45:29.670 --> 07:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
covers um I believe it was that I didn't
 
07:45:33.190 --> 07:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
want to be misquoted about 45% of the
 
07:45:34.628 --> 07:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
budget for the Brin Waterworks
 
07:45:37.910 --> 07:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
department and about 25% for the sewer I
 
07:45:40.110 --> 07:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
mean so you got to
 
07:45:42.350 --> 07:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
think that's a lot of money coming back
 
07:45:44.788 --> 07:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
on the taxpayers if if they're not there
 
07:45:46.788 --> 07:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
you mean water rates will go the tax
 
07:45:49.150 --> 07:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
rate will increase the sewer will
 
07:45:51.510 --> 07:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
increase Berlin is in a very delicate
 
07:45:53.030 --> 07:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
spot right now our back's not against
 
07:45:54.788 --> 07:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
the wall but it will be pretty quick
 
07:45:58.708 --> 07:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
again if uh this fails thank you thank
 
07:45:58.718 --> 07:46:00.190 align:start position:0%
again if uh this fails thank you thank
you

07:46:00.190 --> 07:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:46:02.030 --> 07:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I have to shut it down at
 
07:46:03.510 --> 07:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
this point because we got to be out of
 
07:46:06.628 --> 07:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
the building in six minutes so I am
 
07:46:10.030 --> 07:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
going to recess the hearing public
 
07:46:14.670 --> 07:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 567 FN keep your
 
07:46:17.788 --> 07:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
eye on the house calendar for the date
 
07:46:21.270 --> 07:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
at which the uh public hearing will
 
07:46:24.350 --> 07:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
resume it obviously won't be this week
 
07:46:29.110 --> 07:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
maybe next week or the week after uh and
 
07:46:30.788 --> 07:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
we'll see you everybody get out as
 
07:46:32.468 --> 07:46:32.478 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible so the folks who
