agencies with uh keeping uh all your
 
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
discussions your figures that you talk
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
about um in a one sheet a worksheet we
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
do an agency worksheet that will show
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
you the the various estimates throughout
 
00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
the process so you can keep track um
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
we'll also help with Gen 4 who's who's

great who's been here uh for a while um
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
so Chris will assist you when you put
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
those worksheets together to come up
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
with your estimates where you will then
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
present an a house resolution to the
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
full house uh timing of that is always
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
depending upon dependent upon
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
discussions with leadership uh Etc but
 
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
we are pretty early in the process right
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
now as you know uh the governor governor
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
aot is working on presenting her budget
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
the deadline the statutory deadline is
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
February 15th so the agencies are
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
working on both the revenue and the
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
budget side uh with the governor right
 
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
now um typically when the governor is uh
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
developing their budget agencies are
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
hesitant to really get on record yet uh
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
to the house ways Means Committee on
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
where they think re news will be they'll
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
share all the relevant information but
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
they're still working with the governor
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
right now to kind of fine-tune those
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
estimates and then you can really start
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
to dig into where they are uh
 
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:41.959 align:start position:0%
commissioner stepp is coming in after us
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
so she can explain to you kind of what
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
she's doing with the governor right now
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
um not in detail but just the general
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
time that it takes those agencies and
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
committee so to move on to there's a one
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
pager in your
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
handout and it's called the fiscal year
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
25 uh budget status it is
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
um a point in time document what we see
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh 25 based on the information we
 
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.230 align:start position:0%
uh 25 based on the information we
currently

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
know one thing to know is this has
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
already changed from the time this was
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
printed uh it's going to continue to
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
change as you have your meetings um the
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
the Acer the annual comprehensive
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
financial report for 24 which
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
um provides the balances coming forward
 
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
into 25 for the general education trust
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
fund has been delayed until the end of
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
January it's my understanding there'll
 
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
be another extension our request at the
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
Fisco committee at the January 30th
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
meeting uh I'm not sure how long that
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
extension will be for so until 24 is
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
finalized uh the balance going into 25
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
isn't really known it should change
 
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
between right now um what the Auditors
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
are seeing it could change anywhere
 
00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:05.079 align:start position:0%
between 10 to 15 million between the
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund so
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
these numbers are very fluid um to kind
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
of go over the budget real quickly and I
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
I I will make sure I leave enough time
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
for commissioner step because she's
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
going to give a great presentation uh
 
00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:20.759 align:start position:0%
for the budget it was assumed that 25
 
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
for the general fund would begin with a
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
$42 million beginning balance from 24
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
and the education trust fund would have
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
a balance of 183 .9 million uh based on
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
the preliminary cfer figures general
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
fund was actually 79.7 million so almost
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
37 million over where the budget writers
 
00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
had assumed back in June of
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
23 education trust fund instead of 183.0
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
came down to about
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
158.3 uh million so a lower balance uh
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
two components to that the reason for
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
the lower education trust fund balance
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
is um spending the actual adequacy
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
numbers were higher than budgeted um
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
based on uh the new law that the
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislature had passed and and the
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
update on the student counts that were
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
finalized but also the revenue the um
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner stepp will talk about this
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
as well but the business taxes have not
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
been performing um as they were
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
anticipated it's taking a larger hit on
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund based on those
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
splits than it is on the general fund so
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's even continuing into 25 when we
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
look that was true for 24 it's went into
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
25 where even though the state was down
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
about 40 something million of uh through
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
December on revenues the general fund
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
was up 11 overall because they do have
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
other Revenue sources such as other
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
funds um in in a couple of other uh
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
sources to bail them out whereas the
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
education trust fund was down almost $50
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
million in Revenue so although the state
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
was down the general fund was doing okay
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
so and you can see that on the estimated
 
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.710 align:start position:0%
so and you can see that on the estimated
Revenue

00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
when you look at the estimated revenues
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
on line six carries forward for both the
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
the budget assumptions and uh the
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
current status the year-to-date variance
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
is what's going to change uh throughout
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
the year uh a general fund up 12.6
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
million for revenues uh and the
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
education trust fund down 53.8 million
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
one of the largest
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
um kind of buffers for lack of a better
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
term that the general fund has is the
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
interest it's earning on funds and
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
Treasurer mespelli will uh share that
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
with the committee but the state has
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
significant interest Revenue because of
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
the availability of arpa funds almost
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
two billion of arital funds you have 292
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
M plus million doll in the rainy day
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
fund you have positive balances in your
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
general education trust fund so the the
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
other interest revenue is significant um
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
moving forward into 26 and 27 as those
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
dollars for arer being spent down those
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
numbers will come down and that's
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
something on as a Means Committee you're
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at um going
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
forward net budget Appropriations uh
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
again line 11 the budget writers
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
including laps had assumed about 1.9
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
million in general funds 1.2 million
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
education trust funds um there are
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
unbudgeted Appropriations that aren't
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
anticipated to the general fund about
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
$26.4 million in the education trust
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
fund about 24.8 million um these are um
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
statutory Appropriations things like
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
settlements uh true up to the adequacy
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
calculations um that the state is
 
00:17:36.909 --> 00:17:36.919 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay by Statute so between
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
those two on on line 12 is almost $50
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
million over $50 million of off-budget
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that are going to hit 25
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
that weren't
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
anticipated and then legislative
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
specials legislative specials are bills
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
that the legislature actually passes
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
with Appropriations uh there were um
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
Appropriations passed in 24 due to the
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
revenue higher than anticip ipated but
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
also um in 25 there were some
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations pushed uh off to 25 $
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
45.1 million uh in the general fund and
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
$3.7 million in the education trust fund
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
so if we were to end uh on Friday
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
because I know it has changed the
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
general fund estimated balance at the
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
end of 25 knowing what we know today was
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
about 8 uh million and that's for 25 for
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund um it was $15
 
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.350 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund um it was $15
million

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
positive balance when compared to the
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
budget figures of June of 2023 that's a
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
budget variance in the general fund of a
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
negative 21.2 million and the education
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
trust fund of over 100 million about
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
107.3 million um that education trust
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
fund balance of 125 most likely will
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
come down by another 10 due to uh court
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
ordered placements and some other um
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
auditing activities that are happening
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
now to properly charge it to the the
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
fund so you're probably looking closer
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
to the 115 range at the education trust
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
fund um and then if you look at your
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
general fund we know that the judicial
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
council is going to come into the fiscal
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
committee to ask for additional General
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
funds of about $3 million so that 18
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
will be close to 21 by the end of the
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
month um and there's a few agencies that
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
can come in to ask fiscal committee for
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
additional general fund Appropriations
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
um Justice had already come in uh for
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
several million dollars for litigation
 
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh judicial council is the next one and
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
then Corrections will keep an eye on um
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
and then your Revenue performance you'll
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
be monitoring as a way Means Committee
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be monitoring your Revenue
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
performance for January and February and
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
March you a portion of March as they
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
come in and so that's going to change
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
the lapse amount agencies miss their
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
laps amount that's their unexpended
 
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that are assumed by the
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
um the finance committees they missed it
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
by about $20 million in 24 uh that was
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
the first time the agency laps has
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
estimate has been missed in several
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
years um it is the first year of a bium
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
25 is assuming another
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
117.5 million of laps funds um from the
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
general fund we know that the
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative Services
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
has to put a report together and is
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
working with current governor right now
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
to see how 25 will end the preliminary
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
report shows a lap shortfall of $80
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
million um those are and I'll just
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
caution everyone that's very very early
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of non-aps and funds
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
into the second year of the banum uh HHS
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
has significant non-aps funds into 25
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
that will lapse at the end of the bium
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
so I'd be very surprised to see an $80
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
million lap shortfall that the budget
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
writers will have to take care of uh but
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
it is something to watch so there's a
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
lot of numbers uh that are moving um and
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we stand now we'll
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
be working with with the ways Means
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
Committee but also with the finance
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee um as we finalize this and I
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
can update this sheet once we have the
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
final numbers for your January and your
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
February just so the committee knows um
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
we also use a warrant report from
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
administrative services to see what the
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
off-budget Appropriations are um so I
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
hope this is helpful right now it is
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
kind of showing a trend down so we know
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
going into the 26 and 27 uh budget
 
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:26.919 align:start position:0%
session your revenues most likely aren't
 
00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:30.919 align:start position:0%
going to be as um robust as they were
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
the last few years where the state has
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
really benefited from higher than
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
anticipated revenues I think on a
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
budgeting side the governor sununu in
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
his agency budget request had already
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
requested reductions in agency budgets
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
of close to 4% and I know the governor
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
is currently working with the agencies
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
for further reductions just to be ready
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
for uh when they finalize their revenue
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
estimates so it'll be a little different
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
budget process than it has been in the
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
last few years
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
um so that's something that we can we'll
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
update you as we go through so I can
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
stop there and answer any questions from
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
the thank you um so this sheet you've
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
given us is as of uh January 7th yes
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
Elberta thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um can you please
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
describe exactly what unbudgeted
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
sure so for unbudgeted
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
Appropriations um attorney general
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
litigation for the general fund attorney
 
00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
general litigation expense of about $6.7
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
million um you do have a legislative
 
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
historical fund it's about
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
25,000 uh legal settlements so the AG
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General can enter into
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
legal settlements um so about almost $12
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
million in legal settlements so far in
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
25 and then if we look at a couple of
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
the other big ones abandoned property
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
claims so if the state has abandoned
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
property uh they do need to pay that
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
back when the uh the owners do come to
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
reclaim that so that is a hit on the
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
general fund you'll also be seeing the
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
ised uh abandoned property uh Revenue in
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
other funds when your committee starts
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
to go through estimating revenues but
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
the actual cost uh comes against the
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
general fund um another $100,000 for
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
Border claims death benefits um and then
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh there was a a reallocation of
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
certified Corrections Officers which was
 
00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
a um a house bill to or trailer Bill
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
provision put in so that's the about the
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
$26 million um on the education trust
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
fund side that's the 24 million about 20
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
million of
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
that 20 million of that is estimated
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy payments over what the budget
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
had assumed to years ago based on actual
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
student counts based on actual property
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
tax per pupil and and the various other
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
components so that was over budget
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
another $34 million in education Freedom
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
accounts based on actual usage uh so
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
those are immediate draws off the
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
fund okay
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
thanks any other questions yes thank you
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
quick answer is the Liquor Commission
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
and question sure sure the question was
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
why is the the current eer uh delayed so
 
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
significantly and the biggest reason is
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission made a change to
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
their point of service system um from
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
one system to another system before the
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
end of close of the fiscal year
 
00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:03.559 align:start position:0%
uh hundreds of millions of dollars going
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
back and forth between two systems you
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
really have to reconcile the two systems
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
down to the dollar it was uh what I
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
understand seamless from the consumer
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
but in the back room for the accountants
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it was quite the work so
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
there was a several week delay um in
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
them getting the them being liquor
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
getting the information back to uh our
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
Auditors so we could begin auditing uh I
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
can tell you that lior did have some
 
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
staffing issues with two uh significant
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
Employees leaving uh that that only
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
added to the the the heavy T the big
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
task that they had um but they've also
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
done a good job in hiring additional
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
assistance from Barry dun mcneel uh to
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
help to close that so um that is the
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
biggest that's that's a large issue that
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
has to be resolved prior to the state
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
finalizing um the act for for 24 sure
 
00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:17.450 align:start position:0%
finalizing um the act for for 24 sure
follow

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
I uh so the governor does have the
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come to the fiscal
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
committee to request budget reductions
 
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
and and and um
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
I right now in January I do not
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
anticipate that happening I anticipate
 
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
any of those reductions or lapsing of
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
funds to happen in the budget process um
 
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
I could you could see things and i'
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the governor things like
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
freezes hiring freezers or equipment
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
freezers uh the the typical but no
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
direct cuts to agencies for 25 yet um I
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
know Governor A's probably talking with
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
individual agencies to see to get their
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
lapse number exactly right just to see
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
where we can end up because that is $18
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
million or 20 million on the general
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
fund um that could be made up from a
 
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
lapse as you know um so I do not anticip
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong it could be happening
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
as we speak but I don't anticipate it
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
this far in the year because it takes a
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
little bit for those cuts to happen um
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
even within a hiring freeze you're not
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
going to see any cuts for several months
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
and in a reductions for several months
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
thanks represent
 
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
Alman thank you
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
on does the Liquor Commission
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
problems um mean that the numbers we've
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
changeable I mean there's always a
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
possibility representative that the
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission um what's going on in
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
the audit right now to determine uh the
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
final net profit of the Liquor
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
Commission could have an impact uh we
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything from the
 
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
executive side that that's an issue
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully this is a look back issue from
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
the audit perspective just to make sure
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
24 um is closed out properly and has the
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
proper net profit but going forward I
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
would they've had a they began the
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year with the new point of
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
service so I don't anticipate seeing any
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
um big issues with what they're
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
reporting right now uh what you're going
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
to see in liquor most of the variants is
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
going to be what does um as you know
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
additional funds necessary for the um
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion for the granite
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
care does come if there's additional
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
need that comes from the liquor fund so
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
you're going to see liquor missing their
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
revenue if you look in the revenue Focus
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
part of that and they'll they'll explain
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
to you during ways means part of that a
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
lot of that has to do with the cost of
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid um expansion what has to be
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
drawn down from the liquor fund which is
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
out of control of out of the control of
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
you that was perfect timing now we'll
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%

have in front of them a presentation
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
okay so flipping to page two just to
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
give you an overview of the Department
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration we administer
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
14 taxes for the state and that
 
00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:22.350 align:start position:0%
14 taxes for the state and that
represents

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
represents
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
76.7% or a little over $2.5 billion
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
dollar of Revenue collected for the
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
general and education trust funds in
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
2024 we have important insights into the
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
performance of the state's most
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
significant rever new sources which I'll
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
talk about a bit today but we do lack
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
the capacity to perform more complex
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
economic predi predictions but you have
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
two full days of speakers or a day and a
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
half of speakers behind us who are very
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
well versed in their areas so you'll get
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
plenty of
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
information um the presentation outlined
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
today will talk about what revenues look
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
like year-to date we'll talk about
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
factors that affect the revenues and
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
then we'll look at how revenues are
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
trending compared to
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
plan my goal today is to give you kind
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
of a basic understanding of how the tax
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
types work so that you have a frame of
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
reference for the information that
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear over the next day
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
and a half I believe we'll be coming
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
back to the Committees to do a bit of a
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
deeper dive into exactly how the
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
revenues work and provide you with some
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
more information I didn't want to
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
overwhelm you too too much of today but
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
again wanted to make sure you have a
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
general understanding of the taxes so
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
that you can process the information
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
that you're going to hear for example
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
when you hear from um commissioner
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
Caswell um later on today and you talk
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
about travel and tourism you'll be able
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
to understand or think about how those
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism Trends or things
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
happening in the market could affect the
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax so that's kind of
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
my goal for this morning um I am going
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
to go tax by tax and Mr chair if it's
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay with you I'll pause at after each
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
tax for questions yes I think that's a
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
good idea okay represent Aly did you
 
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
have yes I just want to take issue with
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
lacks the capacity to perform more
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
complex economic problems what you can
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
do today is is c a century past what we
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
had in uh 10 years ago sure yeah we do
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
have a lot of data and we do um a fair
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
amount of work to analyze um based on
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
the DAT that we have but most of the
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
data that comes in comes in on tax forms
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
and so um there is other parts to the
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
bigger picture related to taxes more
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
than just what comes in on the form but
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
we do do our best to analyze the data
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's presented to
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
us okay moving on to page three we'll
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
start talking about the meals and
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
rentals tax so the meals and rentals tax
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
is levied on consumers on the purchase
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
of tax ible meals accommodation rentals
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
and motor vehicle rentals uh the tax
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
rate was historically at 9% through
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
September 30th of 2021 and was reduced
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
to 85% on October 1st of 2021 the taxes
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
collected by the operator and remitted
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
to the Dr monthly so you go out to
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
dinner the tax is collected by the
 
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
restaurant um at the time that you pay
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
your bill and then at the end of each
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
month that operator takes all the taxes
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
that they've collected and remits it to
 
00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:28.870 align:start position:0%
that they've collected and remits it to
the

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
State there are two um transfers that
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
come out of the meals and rentals tax
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
the first is the school building Aid
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
Debt Service um that has been in place
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
for a number of years um and it started
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
at $ 14.6 million in fiscal year 2012
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
and has been gradually decreasing to 6.8
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year 24 and is
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
currently at 6.6 million for this year
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
there is also a municipal Revenue fund
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
transfer where treasury distributes 30%
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
of net meals and rooms income from the
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
most recently completed fiscal year
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's distributed to cities and towns
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
um and then that Revenue comes out of
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
the monthly um collections each month in
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 we'll be sending $1
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
136.6 million to cities and towns
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
through the municipal Revenue fund
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
transfer looking at how M&amp;R has
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
performed over the past few years
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
um we saw a
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
21.7% increase from 21 to 22 an 8.4
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
increase from 22 to 23 and a 3.9%
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
increase from 23 to
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
24 for fiscal year 25 to date we've seen
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
a 3.8% increase over the prior year so
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the growth in M&amp;R has
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
slowed a bit um I believe a good portion
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
of that growth in 21 to 22 that was
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
coming off of the co 19 pandemic um I
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
think a lot of us realized how much we
 
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
liked traveling and liked going out to
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
eat um and so there was some pent up
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
demand that occurred so we saw some
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
pretty significant growth coming out of
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
the pandemic the tax is still growing
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
but the growth has
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
slowed um factors that we look to um and
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
that you'll hear about over the next day
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
and a half um that can impact M&amp;R uh low
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates right when you're
 
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:26.599 align:start position:0%
when we have good solid um employment
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
that does allow consumer to go out to
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
dinner to travel so those low
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates are good for for M&amp;R
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue um the impact of inflation on
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
fuel prices and food costs so talk about
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
fuel prices for a second that could put
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a damper on minr if
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's causing folks to not travel by
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
car as much um but on the other hand
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
with increase in food C costs if that
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
then increases prices at restaurants
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
then that increased price could increase
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals tax because the
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
tax is a function of what you pay at the
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
restaurant so inflation can kind of go
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
both ways um in terms of impact on
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R similar to the unemployment rate
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
strong wages when wages are good and
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's more disposable income um
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
consumers are more likely to spend and
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
that's positive for the meals and
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
rentals tax um and then the weather uh
 
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
being in a state that has four beautiful
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
seasons and many of us um and many
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
others like to travel here to enjoy them
 
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
when the weather is good and that
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
includes Sunny Summers and cold snowy
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
Winters um and everything in between um
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
that tends to increase tourism and
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
increase um the meals and rentals
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
tax on the next slide on page four
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see um historic performance of
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
tax from 2015 to
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
2024 um you will see from
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
21 to 22 there was a bit of a decline
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
that is when the municipal Revenue
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
transfer has started to come out of the
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax so there is
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
underlying growth there but the revenue
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
to the general fund and the education
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund did dip there due to that
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue being siphoned off into the
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
municipal Revenue fund um but generally
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
you know leading into the pandemic
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
pretty um consistent year-over-year
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
growth in the tax we did see a decrease
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
in the tax um with the impact of the
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions related to the p pmic um
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
but as I mentioned on the previous slide
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
we have recovered um quite nicely from
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
that on page
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
five you'll see a breakdown of the
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
portion of the revenue that is
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
attributable to meals that is
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
attributable to rentals so those would
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
be hotel accommodations short-term
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
rentals that sort of thing and then
 
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
rentals so looking at fiscal year
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
2024 just under 80% of meals and rentals
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
tax revenue came in from
 
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.349 align:start position:0%
tax revenue came in from
meals

00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
meals
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
18.8% from um hotel accommodations and
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
other rentals of sleeping accommodations
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
and then just about 2% in motor vehicle
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
rentals this is pretty consistent um
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
year-over gear although starting in
 
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 we've kind of seen um a
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
shift to uh rentals um and a a little
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
bit more away from meals um but again
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
just strong good performance um from the
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax that's the last
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
slide I have on that so I'll pause for
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.829 align:start position:0%
 
Senator

00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
comp sure so the question was any sense
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
of the compliance on Airbnb for M&amp;R um I
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
can't talk about individual taxpayers
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
but I can talk about that sort of of um
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
online tourism industry where you rent
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
accommodations and there's Airbnb and
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
there's a number of other ones um those
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
entities are are licensed um as a single
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
license so if you do operate on one of
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
those online travel platforms um that
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
platform will collect and remit the tax
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
on your behalf so if you um say have a
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
ski condo um up in Lincoln and you rent
 
00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
that through Airbnb you don't need a
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
separate meals and rentals license they
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
will handle as long as you only rent
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
through one of the platforms they will
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
handle that compliance for you um if you
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
happen to also rent off of the platforms
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
you would need to have a second license
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
but I do believe um it makes it a lot
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
easier for folks that are utilizing um
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals um or renting out
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
property on a short-term basis
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
compliance is a lot easier given the
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
online platforms so so I do think
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's been increased compliance as a
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
result of
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
that represent El
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
me yes could you say something briefly
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
about uh there are a large um number of
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
people who are renting their back room
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
to somebody to raise money and uh it
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
seems to be a surprise for them to
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
discover that when you discover them how
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
do you go about looking looking for that
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
market so um depending on how they're
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
renting so if they're not renting on one
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
of the platforms um it can be harder to
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
sort of find those rentals and if
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
they're renting them on a short-term
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
basis so essentially less than six
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
months um that would qualify as a rental
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
under the meals and rentals tax um under
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
statute they're technically supposed to
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
obviously have a meals and rentals
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
license and be posting that license
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
number when they are putting their
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
accommodation out for rent um and so if
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
we do come across postings where we're
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
not seeing a meals and rentals license
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
we would follow up with that individual
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
um also this is the type of situation
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
where other people that are renting and
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
paying the tax um tend to keep an eye on
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
their friends and neighbors who are not
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
and so we will um receive referrals
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes um we have an option on our
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
website to send us an anonymous um um
 
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation of a location that we
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
should look into and so that's sometimes
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
how we get information as
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
that uh solves the mystery I had of an
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
extremely irritated constituent who was
 
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
only putting things up on the billboard
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
in Dartmouth
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock representative ORS thank you
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
question so what what do you believe the
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
impact on the uh tax revenue for fuel
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
and inflation is right now I mean is it
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
significant the
 
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.670 align:start position:0%
significant the
material

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
material
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
so I think what we've talked about
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
previously is um obviously if fuel
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
prices you know the gas pump prices get
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
too high that will cause people to maybe
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
slow their travel right they might not
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
um take those day trips or those long
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
weekend trips that you know um we see a
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
number of cars I drive up 93 every day
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
um and Friday afternoons leaving
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
conquered going north there's a lot of
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
traffic um so if fuel prices get to a
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
point that people decide not to take
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
those weekend trips I think that would
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on M&amp;R I don't
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
think we're seeing that at this point I
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
think fuel prices are relatively stable
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
at the moment um in terms of whether um
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
inflation causes you know input costs
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
food cost to
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
increase it would and then prices
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
essentially increase and so the base
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
that the tax rate is applied to
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
increases that would increase Revenue to
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
the point where the prices get so high
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
that consumers start to demand less
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
right um and so there is that Tipping
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
Point where the prices get too high and
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
you know you're used to going out every
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
Thursday night to your local restaurant
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
for a burger and that burger suddenly
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
gets above $15 you might be like well
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll go every other Thursday and
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's the point where we would see
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
those prices impact um the M&amp;R tax
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
negatively because the demand would be
 
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
less so it's kind of a balancing act
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so from what I'm
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
seeing uh some call it the Trump effect
 
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
but gas prices where I purchase my gas
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
have steadily been coming down and uh so
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
I anticipate that's going to continue
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
and uh just for future reference and for
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
everybody that's listening there is no
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
bad weather in New Hampshire it's poor
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
choices of clothing there you go thank
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
you yes represent opal uh commissioner
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um as a
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
first termer and I apologize to veterans
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
in the room um the school building Aid
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
Debt Service reduction is that a
 
00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
function of demand or legislation
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
strictly a function of legislation as
 
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
the um bonds are paid off the principle
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
and interest decreases so the amount
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
that we need to transfer each month is
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
question yes uh
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
Senator me fers the number of filers
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
changed significantly in the last years
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um I would say
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
we have seen a slight increase in the
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
number of filers um but not really
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
substantially because for every
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
restaurant that might close and new one
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
might open um I think absent the online
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
travel platforms if all of those folks
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
needed to be licensed and couldn't
 
00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:06.559 align:start position:0%
operate under the license of the online
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
travel platform we would see a
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
significant increase um so I think
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
there's definitely more um tax that's
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
being collected but I might not
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily see it in the number of
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
operators follow up so we talk about the
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
Vero have a lot more units
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
exactly okay anything else seeing none
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to real estate transfer
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
tax real estate transfer tax also known
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
as the Rett so the r is a tax on the
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
transfer sale or granting of real
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
property the rate is um
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
a150 but that's going to be split 75
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
cents is the obligation of the purchaser
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
and 75 cents is the obligation of the
 
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.069 align:start position:0%
and 75 cents is the obligation of the
seller

00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
seller
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
so R Revenue in recent years um peaked
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2022 so from fiscal year
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
2021 to 2022 we saw a 10.9% increase in
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue um and then revenues have been
 
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
decreasing so from 22 to 23 we saw an
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
11.6% decrease from 23 to 24 we saw a
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
10.6% decrease um although we might be
 
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
seeing a little bit of a bright light
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
starting with real estate transfer tax
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2025 for the first 6
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
months we are 6.8% below plan but we're
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
6.1% ahead of last year the important
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
thing to know about the real estate
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
transfer tax is you again it's a bit of
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
a balancing act you need the
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
transactions to
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
occur and you also need the price for
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
the tax to come in so we can see and as
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
we have been seeing lower transactions
 
00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:58.559 align:start position:0%
but at higher prices can still generate
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
significant Revenue uh alternatively
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
more transactions at lower prices can
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
still generate good Revenue um for the
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
most part over the past couple years and
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about this on the next slide
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
too um prices of the transactions are
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
high right home prices are at all-time
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
Highs but the inventory and the
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
transaction volume is very low um so I
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
think what we're seeing in these first
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
six months of fiscal year 25 compared to
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
last year is we are seeing some pickup
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
in the number of
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
transactions so factors that affect the
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
r Revenue interest rates obviously when
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
interest rates are high there's a
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
decreased demand people can't afford to
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily um move or purchase a home
 
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
um inflation affecting household budgets
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
right so it's all we're all working off
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
of a pot of Revenue and inflation cause
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
causes other prices to increase that
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
might put a strain on some household
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
budgets the available inventory like I
 
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
said I think that is some of what we're
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
seeing in that we are seeing a little
 
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
bit more inventory out there so more
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
transactions are able to occur and then
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
property values which would in um
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
increase the prices so we saw in New
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a total equalized value for
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
all property in New Hampshire in 2022 of
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
300 almost 312 billion and that went up
 
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:21.630 align:start position:0%
300 almost 312 billion and that went up
to

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
3375 billion in fiscal year 23 so
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
ing on page
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
seven we'll just talk a little bit about
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
how November of this year compared to
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
November of last year we did see a
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
slight decline in the listings um
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
November December can be a bit of a slow
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
time um for Real Estate um but we did
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
see pending sales increase um by 15.4%
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
over the prior year and the median sale
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
price increased by
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
11.1% so there again you have the
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
transactions increasing and the prices
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
increasing and so that's um largely
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
driving the increase that we've seen
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
compared to the prior
 
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
year um for November
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
2024 um a single family home had an
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
affordability index of 73 which is an
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
increase of 9% over the prior year so
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
what's an affordability index
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
um it basically measures whether a
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
typical family earns income to qualify
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
for a mortgage loan on a typical home so
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
take average family average home what
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
would it take to get a mortgage and then
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
how does the essentially the income
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
compare to what they would need and so
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
as an example if you had an index of 120
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
that would mean that the median
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
household income was
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
120% so more than enough to qualify for
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
what you would need for an average home
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at a affordability
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
index of
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
73% the median income is is not enough
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's only 73% of what would be needed to
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
purchase a
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
home this um this affordability index
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
was at 100 right around December of
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
2021 but since the prices have increased
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
and since recently interest rates have
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
gone up that amount has dropped so
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of an index that we
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
watch to just see how easy and likely it
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
would be for folks to be able to um
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
purchase their first home um and enter
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
the real estate
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
market um and then lastly for November
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
of 2024 single family home sales
 
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
increase 3 and a half% compared to last
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
year so again we're seeing those
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
transactions start to pick up um and
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to drive the real estate
 
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.990 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to drive the real estate
transfer

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:50:57.789 --> 00:50:57.799 align:start position:0%
tax going to page eight this is the
 
00:50:57.799 --> 00:51:00.150 align:start position:0%
tax going to page eight this is the
10-year

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
Trend you'll see um 2015 to 2020 pretty
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
steady year-over-year
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
growth 2021 2022 right the demand
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed and prices started to
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
increase and then now in from fiscal
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
22 through fiscal year 24 we started to
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
see that decline as you know again that
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
the inventory isn't really there
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
transactions are not happening and the
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
prices are really high and might be um
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
you know pricing some people out of the
 
00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
market I will say though if you kind of
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
took your pen and you know ignored what
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
happened in 21 and 22 and you look to
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
where we are in 24 we're kind of on that
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
General trajectory that we've been
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
seeing so if you kind of take out the
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
anomalies of what we saw in that postco
 
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
time the real estate transfer tax is
 
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
performing well um and we are increasing
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
again from fiscal year 24 to 25
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
so we just had a bit of a anomalous bump
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
there for a little
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
bit okay great uh represent El me yes we
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
have another problem though that's in
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
your department which is property
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
assessment and and we've got laws
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
binding that which make it difficult to
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
change but um a lot of municipalities
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
are realizing that their way
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
undervalued because of this because we
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
we use recent sales and the recent sales
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
astronomical and that leaves all of the
 
00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:38.950 align:start position:0%
astronomical and that leaves all of the
$250

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
$250
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
$150,000 house
 
00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:43.870 align:start position:0%
$150,000 house
owners

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
owners
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
uh in in much more trouble when we
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
reassess and I've been hearing a lot uh
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
from different individuals around my
 
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
area uh with great fear about the
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
reassessments and I don't know what we
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
can it I don't think there's any way
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
that we can uh smooth the
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
process so um under state law
 
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities are required to reassess
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
property every five years um that is the
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
the minimum interval some municipalities
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
wait and do it every five years um in
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
which case when you take a pre um covid
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
assessment and then you look to doing an
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
assessment in the last year or two there
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
will be significant increases in the
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
value of the property um because of what
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
the real estate market has done in the
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
past couple of years some municipalities
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
are more proactive and they do those
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
reassessments before the fiveyear mark
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
in order to do exactly what you said
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative to smooth out the
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
increase um the increase in an
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
individual properties assess investment
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
again isn't necessarily a bad thing um
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
that is certainly the value of your
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
property increasing is a good thing when
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
it comes time to potentially sell it's a
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
good thing when you want to refinance or
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
take out a home equity loan um it's a
 
00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
good asset to have um where it can be a
 
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
bit of a surprise for folks is when that
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
increase happens on their tax bill um
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
and the increase in their property is
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
more than the average increase in the
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
town so if your property value increased
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
20% in a reassessment year and everyone
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
else's property the average increase was
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
20% and the spend in your town was
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
consistent from one year to the next
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
there will be no change in your tax
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill where you see the changes in the
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
tax bill is if your property increases
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
disproportionately to the other um
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
properties in your community and or if
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
there a significant change to the
 
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
spending in your municipality but just
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
because you see an increased assessment
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily mean you're going
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
to see an increase in your tax bill and
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
many municipalities when they go through
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
a full reassessment they actually see
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
their tax rate drop their per thousand
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
tax rate drop and that's exactly because
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
the increase in the assessment does not
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean a higher tax bill that
 
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
higher tax bill is going to come when
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
the increase is disproportionate and or
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
the municipality decides to spend more
 
00:55:28.799 --> 00:55:30.230 align:start position:0%
the municipality decides to spend more
money

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
followup yes but the problem is that
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
it's extremely difficult to explain that
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
to most of the citizens I
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
understand um the the Dr we do have we
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
put out um some education a couple years
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
ago relative to this exact how the
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
assessments and tax bills kind of
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
function um I recently spoke with a
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
repor at the union leader who is looking
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
into it and again trying to provide
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
education and certainly if you ever have
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
constituents that come to you with
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
concerns you can come to me and um we
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
can also talk to our um Municipal and
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
property division at the Department of
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue to help folks understand we get
 
00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
questions all the time um it is it is uh
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
a difficult thing for sure to
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
understand representative Spar followed
 
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.589 align:start position:0%
understand representative Spar followed
by

00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you uh is the uh
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's collected 100% of it goes
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
to the general and to the education
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
funds Does anything go back to the
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities so with the real estate
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
transfer tax um there is nothing that
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
goes back to the municipalities um the
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
the tax where the money goes back to the
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities is going to be from the
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax follow up follow
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
up uh do the municipalities have any
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
Authority uh legal authority to charge a
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
transfer tax or is that invested with
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
the state they have to go to the state
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
for a permission that's at the state
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
level okay but they can get permission
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
or they can get a um I don't believe
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's any way for uh the
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities to charge a a transfer
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
tax that happens at the state level okay
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative shamberg
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking maybe a two-part
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
question does the
 
00:57:21.309 --> 00:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
Dr have a process of checking the
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
assessments that the towns are supposed
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
to do is it on
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
a and what happens if a town does not do
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
it within the five years great question
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
yes we not only monitor that the
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities are doing the
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
reevaluations reassessments every five
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
years but we also then monitor how they
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
were done and that they were done
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
according to the standards that the
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
state has set so it's kind of two-part
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
we make sure you do it and we make sure
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
you do it properly if a municipality
 
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
does not perform the assessment uh
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
reassessment at the scheduled time frame
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
um we um have a way of going to the
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
board in tax and land appeals and having
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
that reassessment ordered so that would
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
happen if it was not done on time and or
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
if it was not if a reassessment was not
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
done to the standards that the state has
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
set we would petition the board attacks
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
and land appeals and that would go
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
through the process um with the
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
reassessment uh representative
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
M yeah thank you Mr chairman uh my
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
question is is on commercial property
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
rela to residential property could you
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
comment on what you see happening on
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
valuations of commercial versus
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
residential and do you see any disparity
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
in the tax rates between those two sure
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
so um to answer the second question
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
first the tax rate that's going to be
 
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
set by the municipality is going to be
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
the tax rate for all property so there's
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
not going to be a separate commercial or
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
residential rate um but I will say at a
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
high level I think what we've seen um
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
again in the recent years is that the
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
the value of residential property has
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
increased more than the value of
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
commercial property um part of that is
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
due to you know if you take a
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
municipality that has a fair amount of
 
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
office space commercial office space a
 
00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839 align:start position:0%
lot of companies aren't using their
 
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
office space anymore right employers are
 
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
working remote employees are working
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
remotely they don't need that office
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
space it's gone vacant and so higher
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates in commercial property is
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
going to lower um the value so I would
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
say we've kind of seen a shift where
 
00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
maybe commercial property has decreased
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
a bit and the increas is in residential
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
property and even at the residential
 
00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
level you're seeing um we're seeing a
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
greater increase in um the values of um
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
like mobile homes and smaller starter
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
homes um that's where I think we're
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
seeing the biggest increase in the
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
residential Market um because you know
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
the as the prices increase and we talked
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
about that affordability Index right
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
where we're not it's not affordable for
 
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of families so that you know
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
single family home that you were
 
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
planning on
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
purchasing say 10 years ago might not be
 
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
the single family home that you can
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
afford today and so that first home
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
buyer might be now may be looking
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
towards a mobile home where you know a
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
few years ago they were looking at a
 
01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:21.799 align:start position:0%
small ranch for instance so I think
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
those are some of the shifts that we're
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
seeing thank you Mr chairman um could
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
you characterize the uh relative
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
disparities between the increases in
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
commercial property versus residentials
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
one uh Senator
 
01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:53.589 align:start position:0%
one uh Senator
Rosenwald

01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
follow represent
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
equ excuse me for a second we had a
 
01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:11.039 align:start position:0%
little power blip and your your light
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
went out so thank you um that's a great
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
question so the total equalized value on
 
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:19.720 align:start position:0%
page six is all property commercial
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
residential all of it um and so yes that
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
takes into account everything and so
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
when we talk about um equalized value to
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
it that's a bit of a Nuance term that
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
maybe not everyone is familiar with the
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
the goal of producing that total
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
equalized value is to bring all property
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
in the state to Market rates to address
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
if they haven't if a municipality hasn't
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
done a reassessment in five years and
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
their property and their municipality is
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
very undervalued we take that and bring
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
it up so the total equalized value
 
01:01:59.309 --> 01:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
is meant to be the current value of all
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
property in the state regardless of when
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
a municipality has done a
 
01:02:03.559 --> 01:02:13.710 align:start position:0%
a municipality has done a
reassessment

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
follow sure we can definitely look at
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
and bring to the Committees when we do
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
our deeper dive um the value how the
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
value of residential versus commercial
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
has changed in the past few years okay
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
construction that's not necessarily
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
something that we get on our tax forms
 
01:02:57.309 --> 01:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
so um we would necessarily know if a
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
transfer was a new construction or an
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
existing home sale but you may hear more
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
about that from one of the speakers
 
01:03:08.269 --> 01:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
behind me um and if not we can certainly
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
try to find some information on that
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
again wouldn't be data that we would
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily have but that's probably out
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
there somewhere and we can look into
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
said btla can order a reval if Town
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
hasn't done it what if there are no
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
assessors that are coming to the North
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
Country to do that understood um that it
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
the the assessing
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
um world or uh profession is um facing
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
some challenges um that we are very well
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
aware of um I sit on the assessing
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
certification board um
 
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
and that is something that when these
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
predicaments face the individual
 
01:03:59.549 --> 01:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities we are trying to be
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
proactive and have conversations with
 
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
them long before we get to a point of um
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
needing to to order a reassessment and
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
also figuring out ways that we can be of
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
assistance so the Dr has assisted some
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities in some work that's
 
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
needed to be done um but this is this is
 
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
something that that the state is going
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
to have to to tackle um because you're
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
right there is a lack of of assessors in
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
the North Country
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
followup yes followup okay are you aware
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
that there is one town right now in the
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
North country that's under a court order
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
to have a uh reval done this year since
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
they had an extension from 23 to 24 and
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
from 24 to
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
aware um is let me just okay let me just
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
just asked do we have a link on the
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
website that describe on the gr website
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
done so the assessing so short answer is
 
01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:14.119 align:start position:0%
yes um assessing the Dr monitors that
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
the assess the reassessments are done
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
and how they're performed the standards
 
01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:18.870 align:start position:0%
and how they're performed the standards
for

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.589 align:start position:0%
for
setting

01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
setting
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
um the of how the assessments should be
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
performed are done through the assess
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
Standards Board and that is a board
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's administratively attached to the
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue um and so those
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
are the folks that kind of set the
 
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
standards and then we monitor that
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
they're being followed so the short
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
answer is yes you can get there on our
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
website and we can certainly provide um
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
a link for folks to to get to where they
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
need to go right it may be a plus if
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
constituents are asking sure so yes
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
Senator G um I sit on the assessing
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
Standards Board the assessing Standards
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
Board in their last meeting being left
 
01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.630 align:start position:0%
Board in their last meeting being left
Friday

01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
Friday that established a committee to
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
do just exactly what your is trying to
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
find a way to solve the the problem
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
certainly bety Pat Patton was elected
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
the chair of that and if anyone is
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
interested in joining that committee I
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
that Senator
 
01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.109 align:start position:0%
that Senator
Aly

01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
Aly
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
yes I've been having a conversation with
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
my assessor who was an assessor also for
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
some places in the east of the state as
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
well as Lebanon and
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
and he from what I understood at any
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
rate he was saying that well they have
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
for looking at retail and Commercial
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
properties which includes a huge number
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
of residential towers that have gone up
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon in the last few years um
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.829 align:start position:0%
they have been
on

01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
the he is saying that it is no longer
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
economical to build
 
01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.309 align:start position:0%
economical to build
condominium

01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
condominium
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
properties because all of the costs of
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
doing that are in the
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
price whereas and you can can sell it
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
and get the money
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
immediately uh but it doesn't any longer
 
01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
make up for that that and and the the
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
apartment towers that are rental only um
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
are considerably cheaper to build and
 
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to looking at
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
things like the real estate transfer tax
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
or looking at the property taxes going
 
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
forward because there are a number of
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
the elements in the process of building
 
01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
one of those that do not not
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
get considered in the value of the
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
sales yes represent BL um so I want to
 
01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:22.349 align:start position:0%
sales yes represent BL um so I want to
get

01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:24.189 align:start position:0%
 
back

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
correct correct
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
good point yes so the real estate
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
transfer tax is going to be collected um
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
when the deed is filed at the county and
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
then the counties remit that to the
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
state every month and they keep a
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
portion of that Revenue as a commission
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
so you don't we're not receiving um the
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax from any every
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
individual as part of those transactions
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
it's recorded at the county level and
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
passed to the state at that point follow
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that so yeah go back to
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
transaction amounts again I think we
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
kind of have a onew punch going on right
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
now between High inflation enough
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
interest rates housing pric are higher
 
01:09:04.719 --> 01:09:05.749 align:start position:0%
interest rates housing pric are higher
interest

01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:09:05.759 --> 01:09:07.269 align:start position:0%
interest
rates

01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
down right but indications look like
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
again my last looking at the
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
realtor.com U handouts hous prices are
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
starting to drop and we are seeing
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
indication from the F that interest
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
rates are going to start to drop which
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
should hopefully bod well for some
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
upcoming take a little bit to get there
 
01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
but we should see
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
some that be ass you have as well I I
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
would agree um I'm me just flipping here
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
to some data that I have so the real
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax um as I mentioned
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
earlier doesn't come in you know really
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
uniformly across the year right we have
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
good real estate seasons and slower real
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
estate Seasons November December January
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
February that can be a slower time for
 
01:09:54.679 --> 01:09:56.430 align:start position:0%
February that can be a slower time for
transaction

01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
transactions tend to pick up in the
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
spring and summer especially late summer
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
as families are trying to move before
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
the start of the school year so that
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
their kids can start the school year um
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
at their new school and so but if you
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
when I look at how we've been
 
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.149 align:start position:0%
when I look at how we've been
performing

01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
performing
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
um you know fiscal year to date looking
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
only at transactions um from the
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
counties you know July which was for
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
June transaction
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
was up
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
5.4% August was up 2% September was up8
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
October was up 4.4 November was up 1.9
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
so we we're increasing those over the
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
same time period of the prior year um so
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
I think you're right it's it's starting
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
to give a little um and hopefully we
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
continue to see
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
um see no further questions we'll move
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
on okay
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
next tax is tobacco tax so the tobacco
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
tax is going to be
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
collected really in in
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
three almost four but three different
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
ways the first is um when you buy a pack
 
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes so that tax rate is .78
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
per pack of 20 cigarettes and
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
$223 per pack of 25 cigarettes and
 
01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's done by a fixing a stamp to the
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
bottom of the pack the to tax is also
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
levied on other tobacco products which
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
are not ecigarettes so that would be
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
like your loose tobacco um pipe tobacco
 
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and that rate is 65.0
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
3% of the wholesale sales price the
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
Third Way the tobacco tax is collected
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of collected in two different
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
ways under the third way but that's for
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes and that tax rate went into
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
effect on January 1st of
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
2020 and so that is levied on both
 
01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
closed systems and open systems so a
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
closed system is when um it's almost
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
like a pen like the ecigarettes that are
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
that are a pen um they're closed you
 
01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
can't open them they are when they're
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
done you throw it out that is taxed at
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
$30 per milliliter on the volume of
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
liquid or other substance containing n n
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
nicotine sorry 30 cents that might have
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
been a Freudian slip we'll talk about
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
that in a second um
 
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh 30 cents per milliliter um an open
 
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
system is where you purchase the liquid
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
maybe in a little bottle and put it in a
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
device that heats it and um you replace
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
just the the liquid um in the bottle and
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
that is 8% of the wholesale sales
 
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
price so
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
um when you look at what's been going on
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
with tobacco tax revenue from 21 to 22
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
we saw an 88.2% decrease from 22 to 23
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
we saw a 6.1% decrease and from 23 to 24
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
we saw a 12.8%
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
decrease fiscal year 25 we're seeing
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
just about a 4% decrease over the prior
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
year so the the decreases that we've
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
been seeing in the past few years might
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
be slowing a
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
bit um what's been changing with the the
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax is the makeup
 
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
between tobacco tax on the packs of
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
cigarettes versus other tobacco products
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
so um for the first six months of the
 
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
year other tobacco products is just
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
under 20% so that's going to be your
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
loose tobacco and your ecigarettes
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
that's just under 20% of the revenue
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
that we've been receiving but if you go
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
back to 2013 it was just under 4% so
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
we're really seeing this shift in
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue away from traditional packs of
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and towards other tobacco
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
products including ecigarettes
 
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
um things that factors um that
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
contribute to the tobacco tax revenue
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
crossborder elasticity we have a very
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
low tobacco tax rate compared to
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
surrounding states so we see um a fair
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
amount of um tobacco products sold in
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
our states to consumers in other states
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
they'll come buy it here bring it home
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
because our rates are lower um just
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
public sentiment regards to um tobacco
 
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
consumption and the way it's consumed
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
again there's that shift away from maybe
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
more traditional packs of cigarettes and
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
towards this ecigarette Market um and
 
01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
then availability of Menthol and
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
flavored tobacco products that are
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
banned in other states Massachusetts
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
it's a good example few years ago they
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
banned Menthol um and flavored tobacco
 
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
products and we saw a pretty significant
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
increase in demand in our state for
 
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.390 align:start position:0%
increase in demand in our state for
those

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
products looking at at the 10-year trend
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
10 you will see from 2016 to 2019 or so
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
we saw you know a pretty consistent
 
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
year-over-year decline in
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue 2019 to 2021 we saw an increase
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
I think that's due to a couple of things
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
one the stress of the pandemic did not
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
help for people to consume uh tobacco
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
products less and also that was the time
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
period perod when the um ban on certain
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
products in other states occurred and so
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
we saw increased demand come to New
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from 2021 forward we are
 
01:15:38.629 --> 01:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
seeing those revenues um
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
decline on page 11 this will show you
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
just tobacco tax stamp Revenue so just
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
the revenue due to people buying packs
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes you will see that jump
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
from 20 to
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
21 and then the decline the kind of more
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
normal levels um of what we see for
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
cigarette sales on page
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
12 you will see other tobacco
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
products so traditional other tobacco
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
products is in blue and then the yellow
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
or orangish color is the amount of
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue that were're receiving from
 
01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.189 align:start position:0%
Revenue that were're receiving from
ecigarettes

01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
so you will see that the blue has
 
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
increased a bit in recent years but
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
really A lot of the growth in other
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco products is due to um
 
01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.430 align:start position:0%
tobacco products is due to um
ecigarettes

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
is is some of the decline based on the
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
fact that the tax on cigarettes is
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
higher than and I'm not sure how you
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
would compare it but it's basically
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
higher than the other tobacco products
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
and ecigarettes
 
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
so I think part of the decline in the
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
traditional tobacco tax revenue
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
um you don't have the same new users of
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
cigarettes that you may have had in the
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
past and those new users of tobacco
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
products are opting towards ecigarettes
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
or other tobacco products at this point
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
they're to say it maybe more bluntly
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
kids aren't smoking cigarettes anymore
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
um and so but they are using nicotine
 
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
products that kind of fall in the other
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax area so I think that is why
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
you're seeing that decline in the
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
traditional pack of cig and those taxes
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
are relatively low correct the tax on so
 
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
the reason why the tax on other tobacco
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
products is 65.0 3% I know it's a bit of
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
an odd number um but when the tobacco
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
tax was put into place there was the tax
 
01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
on the packs of cigarettes and there was
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
the tax on other tobacco
 
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
products as the tax on cigarettes
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
changed we we the state made the same
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
percentage change to the other tobacco
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
product rate so they've changed
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
proportionately um in that if the
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax stamp rate went up by 5%
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
then the other tobacco product rate went
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
up by 5% so that's why we're at that
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
weird 65.0
 
01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
3% if you consider though for
 
01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:21.550 align:start position:0%
3% if you consider though for
ecigarettes

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
the if you try to equate the
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
um amount
 
01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes how many cigarettes you
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
would have to smoke to to consume the
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
same amount of nicotine that's in an um
 
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.430 align:start position:0%
same amount of nicotine that's in an um
an

01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
ecigarette those rates are not the same
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
so ecigarettes are taxed at a lower a
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
lower rate essentially and so what's
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
happening is those folks that are
 
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
starting to use tobacco products if
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
they're using an ecigarette they are
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
paying less for that same amount of of
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
nicotine if you will and so that's
 
01:18:59.629 --> 01:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
definitely contributing to the decline
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
in Revenue thank you repres Aly yes
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
specific Demand by the Senate uh that we
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
lower the price of ecigarettes
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
considerably below what the house had
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
worked out as an
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate tax on that given that it
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
would get you off of the bad part of of
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
regular cigarettes but that it also
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
would addict a lot of young people to
 
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
nicotine and um it is a decision that
 
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
could be changed if people wanted
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
to right did you have a question R the
 
01:19:51.149 --> 01:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
question is isn't that why ecigarettes
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
are comp are out competing a great deal
 
01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.750 align:start position:0%
are comp are out competing a great deal
regular

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
regular
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
cigarettes I don't know
 
01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.170 align:start position:0%
cigarettes I don't know
necessarily

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.310 align:start position:0%
necessarily
[Music]

01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
um why I I there's you know probably
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
some anecdotal evidence that people do
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
view ecigarettes to be a healthier
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
alternative to cigarettes um but I will
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
say the the rates that are in place are
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
the original rates they have not changed
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
since the ecigarette uh tax went into
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
effect on January 1st of
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
tax one of the concerns we had we end up
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
up legislation for this coming turn was
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that wholesalers and retailers
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
are enforced and licensed by two
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
different agencies and so the question
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
whether a retailer product that they
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
have is and the wholesal pays correct so
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
the question was whether the retail
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
product was we bought from the wholesale
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
we actually paid the tax the state time
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
so we're actually have a bill
 
01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
consolidate over to liquor um who who
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
currently does retail enforcement and
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
investigations and leave auditing with
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
Dr but would allow I think'll see that
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
that passes we consolidate betters
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
around these cigarettes and what's
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
whether not elicit products coming into
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
the state um that not beinged
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
going around it liquor has no way to
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
know on the retail if they don't license
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
uneven so that's a a great Point um the
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax is collected by the
 
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
wholesaler um so the wholesalers are the
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
ones that purchase the stamps from the
 
01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and AFF fix them
 
01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
to the packages of cigarettes and for
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products um the wholesaler
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
charges the tax at the time that they
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
sell the product to the retailer and
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
then we collect the tax from the
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
wholesaler so um that's how the
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
collection works and so as Senator Lang
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
pointed out when you go into a retailer
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
who the tobacco retailers are licensed
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
by The Liquor Commission um there are
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
various ways it's easy when it's a stamp
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of a pack of cigarettes
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know right away whether or not the
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
tax has been paid but when it's other
 
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
tobacco products or ecigarettes we have
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
to start going through invoices and it
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
can make it more difficult to identify
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
um that the tax has been paid but yes
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
the the tax is paid by the wholesaler
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
pre-collected by the
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
wholesaler uh I skipped I skipped
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
represent thank you commissioner
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
as much as I'd
 
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
like um to differentiate between uh
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
speculative analysis and static
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
analysis with the recent tax increases
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts on tobacco products
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
both uh Vapes and uh uh
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
Leaf do you have historical data to show
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
or to correlate between previous tax
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
increases in our bordering states and
 
01:23:26.719 --> 01:23:28.750 align:start position:0%
increases in our bordering states and
our

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
revenues or is it possible to generate
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
that data there is some analysis that's
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
been done I've seen it um by the tax
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
Foundation um has compared rates in
 
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
different states and what what that
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
means the most recent um example is
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
probably when Massachusetts banned
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
Menthol and flavored products um that's
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
when we saw a pretty um New Hampshire
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
saw an increase and Rhode Island also
 
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
saw an increase in their sales um but
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
now I think we're starting to see that
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
kind of taper off so there can be sort
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
of like an initial where am I going to
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
get my product Oh I can drive to New
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can drive to Rhode Island to
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
get it and then over time consumers find
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
other ways to get that product whether
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
they order it online switch to a
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
different product Etc so we tend to see
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
a bump initially but like we've seen in
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
the past couple years it's not
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily sustained um at consumers
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
are um more flexible in how they they
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
consume and so they'll change their
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
behaviors follow up thank you Mr chair
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
uh is there a correlation or has the
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
department done any correlation uh with
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
the anciliary sales uh a product at the
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
same time for example somebody in LOL
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
can't get their menthol cigarettes so
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
they come
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
to aot State Line in Hudson to pick it
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
up but they also say well Mark backs
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
just down the street uh is there any
 
01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
correlation or any ability to even do
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't think we would have the
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
ability to do that the best information
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
we'd had was really just anecdotal from
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
the retailers that were on the border or
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
close to the border at the time that
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts ban went into effect um
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
they did say they started to see a
 
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
significant increase um in the Menthol
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
and flavored products um once that band
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
went into effect so that was really just
 
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
anecdotal through through our
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
conversations with some of the retailers
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
that is hard um so there is an
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
obligation in the statute that if you
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
purchase tobacco products online um that
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
you are the consumer is responsible for
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
remitting the tax and we have forms
 
01:26:12.669 --> 01:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
available on our website to do that it
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
can be hard for us to to track that down
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
and so um we do a variety of of things
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
related to that we participate in um
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax administration groups that
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
exist across the country um and so we're
 
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
aware of larger players in the industry
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
and so we can kind of do specific
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
Outreach um and um auditing relative to
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
those those larger players and so we do
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
just try to keep up with kind of the
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
trends um but I think Senator Lang's
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
legislation will kind of go a long way
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
potentially to just
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
the more retailers that are selling in
 
01:26:59.109 --> 01:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
the state whether they're online or
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar that are licensed or
 
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
monitored or regulated will go quite a
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
long way to making sure all of the tax
 
01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:10.310 align:start position:0%
long way to making sure all of the tax
is

01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
collected uh represent Aly thank you uh
 
01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
collected uh represent Aly thank you uh
our

01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
committee on used to spend a lot of time
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out um how high we
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
could raise the tobacco tax in order to
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
to try to reduce smoking um and and to
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
get more revenue for the state because
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
in those days we wanted more Revenue in
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:27:40.119 --> 01:27:41.629 align:start position:0%
the state
um

01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
and Brian golob came to us and um he's
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
an expert in multivariant
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
analysis he showed us a major link
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
between the price of gas and the amount
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
of Revenue that we were getting from
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
tobacco and what and and what it was was
 
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
a large number of people in neighboring
 
01:28:12.189 --> 01:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
states and even New York and New Jersey
 
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
coming up to us as the lowest price in
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
the country and a nice place to visit
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
and with a van and loading up and going
 
01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.629 align:start position:0%
and with a van and loading up and going
back

01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
inter I think we had something like that
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
going on at one point with
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
Brandy from New York state but um that
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
that I think is pretty much in the past
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
now but that's what we were
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
doing okay um I'm going to take two more
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
questions because we need we're getting
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
we can look into that breakout when we
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
come before the committee with
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
additional detail yep you're welcome
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay one last question representative
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so piggy backing off
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
of what uh representative Amy was
 
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
talking about do we have an idea how
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
much tax revenue the New Hampshire
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
Advantage gives us like we know we get
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
Li extra liquor sales from the
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
surrounding states we talking about
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
cigarettes do we have monetary value
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we can put on that I think the tax
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
Foundation report attempts to do that
 
01:29:33.109 --> 01:29:33.119 align:start position:0%
for cigarettes um so attempts to
 
01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
quantify um and we can bring that um to
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
the committee as well but attempts to
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
quantify essentially how much of our
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
revenue is for cigarettes or tobacco
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
products that are leaving the state so
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
we can bring that
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
information thank you I think we'll move
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a couple of quick taxes
 
01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
here on page 13 and 14 um you know
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
wanting to be thorough and make sure
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
that you have um all of the taxes
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
covered um and then we'll talk about
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
business taxes we saved um the biggest
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
one for last so on page 13 the utility
 
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
property tax is imposed on utility
 
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
property at a rate of
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
$660 per th000 of value and that value
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
is determined by the Department of
 
01:30:23.679 --> 01:30:24.790 align:start position:0%
is determined by the Department of
Revenue

01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
as of April 1st of each
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
year um audited upt Revenue over the
 
01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
past 3 years we saw a 13.4% increase in
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
21 over 22 a slight decrease from 22 to
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
23 a 99.1% increase um from 23 to 24 and
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
then for the first 6 months of this year
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
we are 10.6% above plan um but flat
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
compared to the prior year
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
our tax year 24 assessments were $
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
48.8 million and that's based on a
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
utility property value of 7.3 billion so
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
this tax collects somewhere between $45
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
and $50 million a year um factors that
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
can affect it obviously if we have more
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
um renewable energy facilities come
 
01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
online or any other utility um property
 
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
come online that increases the amount of
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
taxable property the valuation of the
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
utility property because the tax is a
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
direct effect um of the value and then
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
Energy prices supply and demand those
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
things will affect the profits of the
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
utility properties and that will
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
therefore affect their value so
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
relatively small tax but just wanted to
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
thorough yes represent good question Mr
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
chairman commissioner does the Broadband
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
expansion that we're seeing in the state
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
go on you utility property tax or does
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
it go on to the communications tax so
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
the Broadband expansion is going to be
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
internet access um and so we will jump
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
to CST and we'll talk about that there
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
if that works for you
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
Senator um those are going to be yes yes
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
correct yep water sewer that all
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
upt okay um okay sounds good we'll move
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
on communication Services tax so
 
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax is a tax of
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
7% on all way all two-way communication
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
services this tax runs about 30 $
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
million a year um pretty consistent we
 
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
are slightly below plan year-to date but
 
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
we're about
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
4.3% um ahead of Prior year um things
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
that can affect the communication
 
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
Services tax obviously decrease in
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
landlines um for a while you may have
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
had a cell phone and a landline um so
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
both of those are taxable now if you
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a landline and you only have
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
a cell phone now only your cell phone's
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
taxable um modern pricing and purchasing
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
trends for Wireless Communications so
 
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
and this is going to partially answer uh
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg's question
 
01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
um CST we tax two-way communication but
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
we do not tax internet access so that is
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
prohibited under federal law the CST
 
01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
used to tax internet access and we were
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in um federally to be able
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
to do that but we have since um we know
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
no longer tax internet access and so we
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
can't go back to taxing it again um
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
so Broadband expansion is really
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
internet access you know from a CST
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
perspective um so where Modern pricing
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
and purchasing trends for Wireless
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
Communications come in is not all of
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
your cell phone bill is
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
taxable Only The Voice and text portion
 
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
not the data portion because we can't
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
tax internet access
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
and what we've seen in recent years is
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
more and more wireless communication
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
companies are attributing more of your
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
data right more and more of your bill is
 
01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
so that you can surf the web on your
 
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
phone less of your bill is related to
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
actual Voice or
 
01:34:51.629 --> 01:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
text that being said VoIP and video
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
conferencing is two-way communication it
 
01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
happens over the internet but it's still
 
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
two-way communication and so that is
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
taxable so we've just kind of seen a bit
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
of a shift in the communication Services
 
01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.790 align:start position:0%
of a shift in the communication Services
tax

01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
landscape um but historically it it was
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
higher but in the past few years it's
 
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
been pretty consistent right around $30
 
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
million a
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
year sounds good I'm just going to take
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
two questions at most on this one
 
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
because the business taxes I'm sure are
 
01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
going have a lot of questions represent
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
shambar thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner I guess my question was
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
when they put up more poles or add new
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
lines for the
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
Broadband is that part of the assessment
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
value that goes into the utility it
 
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
depends on who owns the poles and who
 
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
owns the wires um typically with the
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
Broadband expansion it depends on the
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
area whether the poles are there already
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
and they're just stringing wires versus
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
new poles so it it depends on the area
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay one more question seeing none we'll
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
go on to business taxes okay this was so
 
01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
that you would stay all the way to the
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
end um business
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
taxes okay so there's two business taxes
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have the business Enterprise tax and
 
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax the bet or the
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax is assessed on
 
01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
the sum of all compensation interest and
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
dividends that are paid by the business
 
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax is assessed on
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
the income
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
from the conduct of business activity
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
within the state so more of a
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
traditional income
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
tax the BPT conforms to the Internal
 
01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue code in effect on December 31st
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
2018 for taxable periods beginning on or
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
after December 1st of 2020 I put that in
 
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
there and we'll talk more about this
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
when we come before the Committees um
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire follows what's called
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
Static Conformity we pick an internal
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
revenue code and that's the Internal
 
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue code that we follow um the
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
legislature we report to you in March of
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
every year on changes that have occurred
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
federally and the legislature can make
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
the decision to update the reference to
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
the code or not other states are um
 
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
what's called rolling Conformity and
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
they pick up all the changes that happen
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
at the federal level New Hampshire has
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
opted to to be fixed Conformity so that
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
we can look at the changes at the
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
Federal level the federal code and
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not we want to adopt
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
those um and we can make the option to
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
adopt some or not all so again we'll
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
talk about that more when we come before
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
the committee but as you're hearing in
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
the Press about potential changes to the
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
internal revenue Co code at a federal
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
level that's not something necessarily
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
that would impact New Hampshire
 
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
immediately we would have to make the
 
01:37:48.669 --> 01:37:48.679 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the Internal Revenue code
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
reference in order to pick up those
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
changes at the federal
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
level uh fact that affect business taxes
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
obviously the economy um federal tax
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
reform and stimulus programs we've seen
 
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
you know a fair amount of of money in
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
the economy over the past few years
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
related to the covid-19 stimulus
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
programs I think that has largely made
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
its way through the economy um and is to
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
the point where it is in a less liquid
 
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
state at this point which is one of the
 
01:38:20.589 --> 01:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
reasons why I think we're seeing a
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
decrease in business taxes which I'll
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
talk about in a little bit
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
um mergers and Acquisitions as companies
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
merge and expand that's generally good
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
for the tax base um any credits or
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
exemptions that exist in the law can
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
obviously impact how that um how our
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
taxes are collected and that would go
 
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
along with statutory changes so as the
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislature makes changes to the
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
business taxes um that will impact our
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
revenue and as bills come before the
 
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
Committees with statutory changes we'll
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
obviously work closely with you to to um
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
identify potential
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
impacts on page 16 just two um
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that have happened
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
recently that I wanted to
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
highlight one is the cap on credit
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
carryovers so businesses make estimated
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
payments to the state and then at the
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
end of the year they file their final
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
return sometimes they've paid in more
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
money than they owe and they have an
 
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
option at that point to either keep that
 
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
money on account and say you hold it
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
I'll use that later or they can ask for
 
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
it as a
 
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
refund for taxable periods ending on or
 
01:39:36.109 --> 01:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
after December 31st of
 
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
2022 the law now says if you want to
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
keep it on account you can't keep more
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
than 500% of your liability so if your
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
liability last year was
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
$100 then your credit carryover cannot
 
01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
be more than
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
500 um and this was partially due to a
 
01:39:56.109 --> 01:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
decision by the legislature because our
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
credit carryover liability was growing
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
there were many companies that were
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
choosing to um leave their money on
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
account and that liability was growing
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
pretty significantly so the cap is
 
01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
currently at
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
500% that will go to
 
01:40:16.109 --> 01:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
250% for tax periods ending onor after
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 20129 and will go down
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
to 100% for taxable periods ending onor
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
after December 31st of
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
2031 so what that means is that the
 
01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
state has less of a potential liability
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
for monies that it would owe back to
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
businesses but once this cap went into
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
effect in this past year we saw pretty
 
01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
significant increase in our refunds
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
because if you have more than 500% on
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
your account we have to refund the
 
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
difference to you um again we can talk
 
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
about this more in detail when we come
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
before committees but that credit
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
carryover cap on one hand reduces the
 
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
state's liability but we have seen that
 
01:41:00.669 --> 01:41:00.679 align:start position:0%
it has reduced the amount of money that
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're needing to send back to businesses
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
and that might be just a bit of a timing
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
issue as businesses get more accustomed
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
to this cap um but at least that's what
 
01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
we saw in fiscal year 24 um the only
 
01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
other thing I would noce we saw a slight
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
reduction in the BPT rate from 7.6% to
 
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
7.5% for taxable periods ending honor
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
after December 31st of 2023
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
and historic rates are are shown in the
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
17 you will see fiscal year
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
2015 through fiscal year 24 business tax
 
01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
revenue and I would call your attention
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
I think to the column in the middle that
 
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
says change in Revenue
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
percent and what you'll see here is that
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
business taxes can be volatile they are
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
our largest source of Revenue and they
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
are also probably our most
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
volatile um so you you see in fiscal
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
year 2016 we had almost a 25% increase
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
in revenue from the prior year and then
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
2017 it fell almost
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
9% um in recent years you will see
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
though that we revenues have been
 
01:42:20.589 --> 01:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
growing so a 41.3% increase in revenue
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
from 20 to 21 22% % from 21 to 22 just
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
under 3% from 23 to 24 and then we saw a
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
slight decrease in revenue from
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
23 to 24 for the first 6 months of the
 
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we are 155% below plan and
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
18 factors that imp
 
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
revenues so looking a bit to the past as
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
I mentioned economic stimulus I think
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
has driven revenues over the past few
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
years there a lot of money that was put
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
into the economy and it made its way
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
through in a variety of
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
ways um also as I mentioned legislative
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
changes that CCO cap needing to increase
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
um or refund more money then we had
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
historically and also we've seen a
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
couple of changes um in how we a portion
 
01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:26.719 align:start position:0%
business tax revenue in New Hampshire so
 
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
what that means is when you are a
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
business that's operating in multiple
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
States apportionment is how we tell you
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
that you need to figure out what portion
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
of your Revenue p is revenue that New
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should um receive tax on uh
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner steep if you don't mind I
 
01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
think we'll take qu on this one
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
questions in between because uh a lot of
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
slides uh
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
represent uh thank you commissioner uh
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
you talking about being 15 below plan
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
which is fine because that up and down
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
and whatever uh often times we've seen
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
that reverse itself dramatically in
 
01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.709 align:start position:0%
that reverse itself dramatically in
April

01:44:05.709 --> 01:44:05.719 align:start position:0%
April
 
01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
which we'll
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
see but you did make a comment regarding
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
the uh availability availability of
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
stimulus funds our recent
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
M2 comment came out saying that there
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
was so much money in the market that
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
the value of each dollar has shrunk so
 
01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
much that you needed more to cover the
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
same cost of something that what has
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
been the effect of the increase of the
 
01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:35.910 align:start position:0%
been the effect of the increase of the
money

01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:44:38.669 --> 01:44:38.679 align:start position:0%
supply the the currency on
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
hand to the New Hampshire
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures as it cost us more money as
 
01:44:50.109 --> 01:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
it cost us less money or real money not
 
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
dollar-wise but more pieces of currency
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
as it
 
01:44:59.310 --> 01:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
were I don't know if I know the answer
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
question so where I'm coming at the
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
stimulus money is is understanding how
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
that money makes its way to taxable
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
profits of businesses where we then
 
01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:23.719 align:start position:0%
receive business profits tax rep Rue or
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise Revenue if if the
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
stimulus Money Paid wages and or
 
01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
dividends and and we receive the money
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
that way what I what I'm feeling like
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
has happened is
 
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
that the money has made its way sort of
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
beyond that taxable profits level and
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
that a lot of that stimulus money is in
 
01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
Investments and so let's say it's it's
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
in Investments and an investment company
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
would potentially that would make it to
 
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
its bottom line for taxable profits but
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
maybe that money when it started got
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
spent at a retail store and that retail
 
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
increased I think what's happened is the
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
stimulus money is not hitting the bottom
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
line taxable profits in as many
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
originally and so that's why not that
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
the money is not there I mean it is
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
still in the in the economy it didn't
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
evaporate but how is it is it still
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
impacting the taxable profits of
 
01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
businesses maybe for a lot of people the
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
stimulus money is now in their home
 
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
right they used that money they did home
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
renovations they saw their their real
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
estate tax assessments increase right
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that's but you know when it's at
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
that point when it's in someone's home
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's not a a taxable business profit
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
day so that that's what I kind of mean
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
of of the money kind of running through
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
it it's almost like past the point of
 
01:47:15.589 --> 01:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
where we would see it come in as
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue if that makes sense yes thank
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
but to get back to the question is when
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
you increase the volume
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
M each
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
less building the reservoir over here
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
sure because there's so much here yep
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
that in order to equal what you were
 
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.430 align:start position:0%
that in order to equal what you were
spending

01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
spending
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
yesterday you have to spend more
 
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
today is that the situation in which we
 
01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.270 align:start position:0%
today is that the situation in which we
find

01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves I think that could be
 
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
contributing to it certainly
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
that right when the the money came into
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
the economy originally we
 
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
hadn't the drops were bigger I guess to
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
use your
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
analogy right when that when the
 
01:48:14.430 --> 01:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
stimulus money first hit the economy we
 
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
hadn't seen inflation increase the the
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
drops were bigger okay now as we've
 
01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
worked our way through the past few
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
years we've seen inflation increase
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
we've seen prices increase those drops
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:35.719 align:start position:0%
smaller thank you maybe repres me thank
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
you uh it doesn't look like you're
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
covering the shift in in when the
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
company's revenues hit the
 
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
Dr uh and could you say something about
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
the two to threee gap between when the
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
company earns money and when you see an
 
01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:02.679 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease in revenues we're
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
going to get to that in a couple slides
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
oh you will we just didn't get there I
 
01:49:08.189 --> 01:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
looked briefly and couldn't find it
 
01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
we'll move uh one last question Senator
 
01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:14.030 align:start position:0%
we'll move uh one last question Senator
Lang

01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
also grants are given the pay right to
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
keep people employed so the state didn't
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:35.470 align:start position:0%
 
at

01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
this correct so we're not see that grow
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
got we see 21 22 because were invested
 
01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
we saw grow
 
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
now correct I think you're you're
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
exactly right and we'll talk about that
 
01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
um also on the next slide um so just to
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
finish off slide 18 you know things that
 
01:49:59.470 --> 01:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
that we look at in terms of future
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
business tax revenue like I said we'll
 
01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
work with you all closely on any future
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
legislation um and any statutory changes
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
that would be implemented relative to
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax or business
 
01:50:12.589 --> 01:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax revenue um things we're
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
just generally watching in the economy
 
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
Supply train chain
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
constraints um you know disruption
 
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
Imports in factories anytime you hear
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
Rumblings of strike
 
01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
um or impact on Goods moving in any way
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
shape or form that's something that that
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
could impact the economy same with any
 
01:50:32.669 --> 01:50:32.679 align:start position:0%
potential tariffs or
 
01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:35.719 align:start position:0%
sanctions um inflation rate seems to
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
maybe be coming down a little bit at
 
01:50:39.629 --> 01:50:39.639 align:start position:0%
least has tempered a bit um but
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
something we'll keep an eye on and then
 
01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
low unemployment rate again is is good
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
um for business profits tax and business
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax we'll keep looking at the
 
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
potential interest rate changes global
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
geopolitical stability
 
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
or instability maybe is a better term to
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
use there um and just general economic
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
uncertainty although it it maybe doesn't
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
feel as uncertain as it has I think
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang is right that we may just
 
01:51:12.069 --> 01:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
be kind of at a new normal um after
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
years of growth and flipping to page 19
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
you can kind of see
 
01:51:20.069 --> 01:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
that if you look at
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
2019 and you look at 202 4 and you
 
01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
ignore 21 22 and
 
01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
23 you kind of just see a nice
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
trajectory there um and that just an
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
underlying growth in the economy and so
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
it is I do think we're just kind of
 
01:51:44.069 --> 01:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
experiencing a little bit of a reset and
 
01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
we're not going to continue to see this
 
01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth that we saw in you
 
01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:49.510 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth that we saw in you
know

01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
2122 um continue and that we're kind of
 
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
at a bit of a new normal
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
here on page 20 this gets a little bit
 
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
towards um representative aly's point in
 
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the timing um and when we
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
typically see
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
revenues so what you'll notice on page
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
20 is
 
01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
that the largest portion of these bar
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
charts the biggest color is red and and
 
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
read our estimates so businesses are
 
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
required um when they meet certain
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
conditions to pay for quarterly
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
estimates to the state that's how we get
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
the majority of our business tax revenue
 
01:52:38.030 --> 01:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
it comes in the form of
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
estimates unfortunately estimates
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
contain the least amount of information
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
it gives me the business name the tax
 
01:52:49.709 --> 01:52:49.719 align:start position:0%
period end date and an amount there's no
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
explanation on the estimates of why
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
they're making that estimated payment um
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
we don't know that information until the
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
business files the return so only once a
 
01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
business files the return do we get all
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
of that supporting detail about what has
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
gone on in that business during the year
 
01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
for a calendar year tax filer um their
 
01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
initial returns are due in either March
 
01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:17.669 align:start position:0%
initial returns are due in either March
or

01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
April however if they have paid in in
 
01:53:23.950 --> 01:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
their estimates the amount of money that
 
01:53:26.589 --> 01:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
they owe they get an automatic
 
01:53:29.550 --> 01:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
seven-month extension to file their
 
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
return so we receive many returns in the
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
fall in the October November time frame
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's almost a year after their tax
 
01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
period ended in almost two years since
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
the tax period
 
01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:49.719 align:start position:0%
started so to representative aly's point
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
you know we're receiving money every
 
01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:52.990 align:start position:0%
you know we're receiving money every
quarter

01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
but we don't always really know why or
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
what's going on with that money
 
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
until at least 10 months after or so as
 
01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
much as 10 months after the tax period
 
01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:08.679 align:start position:0%
ends and so that's where we can see that
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
bit of a delay in terms of really
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
understanding what's going on which is
 
01:54:15.069 --> 01:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
why it's so important for you all to
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
hear from everybody else that's going to
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
talk after me over the next day and a
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
half to understand you know what they're
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
hearing or seeing or what they um not to
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
be about what's going on in the economy
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
because most of what we get is old news
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
it moving on to page
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
21 the important thing really to know
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
here is that the vast majority of
 
01:54:44.109 --> 01:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
business tax revenue comes from
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
corporations um so we do have some
 
01:54:48.589 --> 01:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and proprietorships that
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
that pay business tax revenue but the
 
01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:53.800 align:start position:0%
vast majority comes from uh corporations
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of that
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
Corporation Revenue comes from large
 
01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:01.030 align:start position:0%
Corporation Revenue comes from large
multinational

01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.709 --> 01:55:05.719 align:start position:0%
corporations page 22 is just going
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
to give you um just a graph on how
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
business profits tax versus business
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax has been performing over
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
the past few years and really the the
 
01:55:19.069 --> 01:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
thing I just want to highlight is the
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
significant increase in business profits
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
um over the past few years and that you
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
can see by the increase in the blue line
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
um we most of the the growth in the
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
business taxes as a whole has been
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
relative to the business profits tax as
 
01:55:37.229 --> 01:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
as corporations um have seen significant
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
years um and
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
then on page
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
23 this is just kind of a way to see
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
everything in one place together all of
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
the taxes that we talked about um again
 
01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see the majority of our Revenue
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
comes in the form of business taxes most
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
of our other taxes have been fairly
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
years on page 24 just because again I
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
want to be thorough this includes the
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax that tax has
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
been repealed um as of January 1
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
2025 we will receive indd Revenue um in
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
April as returns for um the 1231 24 year
 
01:56:32.589 --> 01:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
end um are filed so we're not done
 
01:56:34.109 --> 01:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
receiving indd revenue and we will
 
01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
continue to receive it you know in the
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
future um through various compliance
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
efforts and just as folks um not
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
everyone files timely so we'll we'll see
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
indd Revenue Trail off but I did just
 
01:56:48.910 --> 01:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
include it here um for the purposes of
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
everyone understanding because there is
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
indd revenue in fiscal year
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
25

01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
26 this again is just to give you kind
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
of a summary of where we are in fiscal
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
year 25 to date so through the end of
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
December we have collected a total of
 
01:57:18.639 --> 01:57:20.310 align:start position:0%
December we have collected a total of
926

01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
926
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
um. 6 million
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
plan for the first six months was just
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
over a billion so we're about eight and
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
a half 88.8% below
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
plan but in the last column I would just
 
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
note plan still has us collecting more
 
01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
than half of the revenue for the year so
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
again as I said earlier not all of our
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
taxes come in consistently every month
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
or consistently in the first half of the
 
01:57:48.189 --> 01:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
Year versus the second so as
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative erery alluded to with
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
business taxes we are behind but almost
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
60% of the revenue is still due to
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
become to come in in the second half of
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
the year and that's through estimated
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
payments in April returns in March and
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
April and then returns and extensions in
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
March and April and then another round
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
of estimates in June so again we are
 
01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
behind but plan would still have us
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
collecting the majority of the revenue
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
in the second half of the
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
year I mentioned just another one to
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
give as an example I mentioned that R
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't flow in evenly month to month so
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
you can see that the first half of the
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
year is stronger for us for R um and we
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
expect less than half of the ret Revenue
 
01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
to come in in the second half of the
 
01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
year which generally makes sense as
 
01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking January through June um
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
you still have those cold dark winter
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
months um where transaction volumes are
 
01:58:44.589 --> 01:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
low in on the last slide in case you're
 
01:58:47.709 --> 01:58:47.719 align:start position:0%
curious um other taxes that we
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
administer um that don't hit the general
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund in the same way
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
that the ones that we covered the
 
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement tax Nursing
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
Facility quality assessment the railroad
 
01:59:02.669 --> 01:59:02.679 align:start position:0%
tax and private railroad car excavation
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
tax Timber tax and the Statewide
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
education property tax so these are ones
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
you won't need to worry about
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily doing Revenue estimates for
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
but in case you ever wanted to know um
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
the whole picture of Dr this will give
 
01:59:20.910 --> 01:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
it to you excellent um any questions
 
01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you commissioner uh going back
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
to the the business and profits tax uh
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
in response to some recent news articles
 
01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
or editorial articles it seems to me
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
that Dr has some correlation
 
01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.069 align:start position:0%
that Dr has some correlation
someplace

01:59:45.069 --> 01:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of Revenue you said roughly
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
60% is is going to be collected over the
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
next several months fine
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
understood where do we stand now
 
02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
compared to other and this minus5
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't that's year to date but
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
regarding mone's coming in and money and
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh being below plan my recollection is
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
is that annually we're below plan at
 
02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:18.790 align:start position:0%
is that annually we're below plan at
this

02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:00:21.709 --> 02:00:21.719 align:start position:0%
point uh in most instances except for
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
the recent uh uh after we cut the
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes there was a or business
 
02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639 align:start position:0%
taxes there was a huge rebat of money
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
take that little blip out but it seems
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
to me that this time of year is normally
 
02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
a negative time of year or low time of a
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
year as opposed to the next couple of
 
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
months is that an accurate assessment of
 
02:00:46.350 --> 02:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
where we are now we can look into that I
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to I don't want to answer
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
definitively without doing the math cuz
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
I like math um but I will say I will say
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
um this the second year in the biennium
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
is the oldest Revenue estimate if you
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
will right so so the the fiscal year the
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
right and you could jump to essentially
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
the least accurate so these were Revenue
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
estimates you know that were done two
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
years ago at this point and so right
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah two and a half years ago so the
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
second year of the bium that's the
 
02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
hardest year to develop plan for um and
 
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
then when you're you're in it you
 
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
haven't adjusted planned with any of the
 
02:01:38.109 --> 02:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
information that's coming at any time in
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
the in the last two and a half years so
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
we can look at how ta How revenues
 
02:01:45.629 --> 02:01:45.639 align:start position:0%
typically Trend at this time of year
 
02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
compared to how we end the year and that
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
will be helpful as we talk about Revenue
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
estimates because that's part of how we
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
develop them um but I will say just a
 
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
reminder that you know this is this is
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
the these are the oldest estimates when
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
you get into the second year of the bium
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.589 --> 02:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
representative commissioner do you have
 
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
a way to tell how much of the business
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
taxes are collected
 
02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
by buses that
 
02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:20.830 align:start position:0%
by buses that
areed

02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
areed
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
inire so the the way the easiest way for
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
us to answer that question is we have um
 
02:02:30.069 --> 02:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
when you talk about
 
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
corporations we have um a form called
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
the 1120 which mirrors the federal 1120
 
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
for corporations and then we have an
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
1120 Wei and we stands for Water's Edge
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
and those that 1120 we form is a
 
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
different form and those are the
 
02:02:49.629 --> 02:02:49.639 align:start position:0%
multinational businesses and so that's
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
the easiest breakdown that we have and
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
we do break down that information in our
 
02:02:56.069 --> 02:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
annual report and we can certainly bring
 
02:02:58.510 --> 02:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
that information um to the
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee follow up do you
 
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
mucher I will say the majority of the
 
02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
revenue that we receive for business
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
taxes comes from wat's Edge corporations
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
so the way the Medicaid enhancement Tax
 
02:03:52.589 --> 02:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
Works is kind of two-part we collect the
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
tax from the hospitals um based on the
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
the tax base and the rate that's in
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
statute and then we essentially turn
 
02:04:04.589 --> 02:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
that money over to
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
HHS um for their use relative to
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share and provider
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
payments and the whole statutory scheme
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
there so we're really only on the front
 
02:04:18.549 --> 02:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
end um and so to the extent that there's
 
02:04:21.149 --> 02:04:21.159 align:start position:0%
any conversations about changing um the
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
base to which the Medicaid enhancement
 
02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
tax is applied or the rate at which it's
 
02:04:26.669 --> 02:04:26.679 align:start position:0%
applied that's where we would get
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
involved um and then on the spend side
 
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
that would be with the Department of
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
Services represent El thank you uh in
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
the past
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
until maybe two terms ago uh Ways and
 
02:04:46.990 --> 02:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
Means would do updates of estimates when
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
we saw things
 
02:04:53.109 --> 02:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
changing um we we been a little
 
02:04:53.119 --> 02:04:54.709 align:start position:0%
changing um we we been a little
bit

02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh messed up uh in the last couple of
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
years and uh I think that it would
 
02:05:08.109 --> 02:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
probably be helpful if we started that
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
back up
 
02:05:12.549 --> 02:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
again that's at the call of the chair
 
02:05:15.709 --> 02:05:15.719 align:start position:0%
the chair decides whether things are
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
changing enough that we need to look at
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
them the way we're going to be looking
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
at them now yeah well as I look into my
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
crystal ball we'll we'll see how see how
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
that goes but uh certainly our first
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
step is to come up with our Revenue
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
estimates for the next bium and then
 
02:05:34.549 --> 02:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
we'll keep close a close eye on how
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
things are going and if things are
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
changing um you know in a in a way
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's significant obviously we will and
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.589 --> 02:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
I don't but we're once we receive them
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
um we usually put together a report um
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
of how they've come in um and we will
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
share that um we'll do our
 
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
Lang your presentation online on 19 and
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
20 Pages I'm going start with 20
 
02:06:21.719 --> 02:06:36.790 align:start position:0%
20 Pages I'm going start with 20
look

02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
at it's netted out when it's reported it
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
is netted out when it's reported correct
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
and so I failed to mention that on page
 
02:06:47.470 --> 02:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
20 you'll see that in that larger Orange
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
Box um at the bottom um which is going
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
to net out those are the refunds and so
 
02:06:56.669 --> 02:06:56.679 align:start position:0%
we saw almost a 90% increase in refunds
 
02:06:59.589 --> 02:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2024 and that's largely
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
due to the credit carry over cap follow
 
02:07:04.589 --> 02:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
so given that we're not actually going
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
to be we're changing the credit carry
 
02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
for a few years out now um we should
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
expect that in 26 and 27 that
 
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
orange years so while we may still
 
02:07:21.790 --> 02:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
collect 1.4 here the actual carry
 
02:07:25.149 --> 02:07:25.159 align:start position:0%
refunds are they should be they should
 
02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
be as long as the the hope is that
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
businesses learn I mean there's nothing
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
there nothing stopping them from making
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
the estimated payments that produce that
 
02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
greater than 500% credit carryover um
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
but presumably there would be a change
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
in behavior and so we should see those
 
02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
refunds um decline hopefully their CPAs
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
or whoever is doing their accounting is
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
informing them that you don't have to
 
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
get it down to 250 yet right so and
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
those for those of you who are new this
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh the 250 was going to be I believe
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
starting this year right uh but we
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
pushed it out five years uh knowing that
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
or worrying that uh things were changing
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
too quickly we wanted to change that
 
02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
behavior yes represent ORS thank you Mr
 
02:08:13.149 --> 02:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks again for taking my
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
question so just out of curiosity first
 
02:08:18.030 --> 02:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
of all this money that the state has
 
02:08:21.629 --> 02:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
been able to hold on to that uh is going
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
to eventually start to go down obviously
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
are we going to lose interest money on
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
that I mean are we getting interest on
 
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
those funds we're
 
02:08:34.589 --> 02:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
holding yes um yes the short answer is
 
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
yes it's in it's in the and the
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
treasurer we'll speak to this it's in
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
the the bank account like anything else
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
um and so yes there'd be a reduction in
 
02:08:44.189 --> 02:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
in interest income to the extent that
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's being earned thank you follow-up
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
question followup and so on the business
 
02:08:53.470 --> 02:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:56.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
19 uh we're looking at it looks like on
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
page 16 we see that the tax rates
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
obviously gone down over time we've cut
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
the tax rate from 72% now we're at
 
02:09:15.870 --> 02:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
0.55% but the revenues continue to climb
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
so are we looking at this being
 
02:09:20.549 --> 02:09:20.559 align:start position:0%
sustainable in other words as we've cut
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
the rate we can continue to grow the
 
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
revenue it looks like and what would we
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
attribute that to so um the rates have
 
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know decreased as you're showing on
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
um on page 16 um but I think we've also
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
seen a significant increase over this
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
time period of just the base in the
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
economy um and so it's it can be very
 
02:09:48.549 --> 02:09:48.559 align:start position:0%
hard to separate those two things from
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
each other um so when we
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
if there are any bills this session to
 
02:09:56.669 --> 02:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
change the business tax rates we treat
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
it as a static analysis where we just
 
02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
take the base and apply the new rate and
 
02:10:03.149 --> 02:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
so a reduction in the rate would mean a
 
02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
reduction in Revenue we don't factor in
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
whether the rate reduction would be
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough to change behavior
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
that would result in a larger base um we
 
02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
don't go that way we just treat it as as
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
strictly um a static analysis but I
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
because it is very hard to separate at
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
out what are just underlying changes in
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
the base
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
versus whether or not that change would
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
occur with or without the tax rate
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
change yeah okay because having done
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
taxes in another state i' I learned that
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
as the tax rate dropped more people were
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
willing to step up and pay the tax
 
02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
versus hide it or avoid it so thank
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
youate it I'm going to take one more
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
question from representative Aly and
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
then just realize that we will have Dr
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
back for a deeper dive uh on these taxes
 
02:10:50.639 --> 02:10:51.950 align:start position:0%
back for a deeper dive uh on these taxes
representative

02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I just the page
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
17 really shows you something about this
 
02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
on in 16 we had a major increase in
 
02:11:09.629 --> 02:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
1514 uh in in the companies on that was
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
the year that New
 
02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on grw GRE to the same level
 
02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
from the depth of the recession of the
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
Great Recession uh to the same level as
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country which because it
 
02:11:38.109 --> 02:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
has income taxes and sales taxes gets
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
more immediate uh
 
02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.350 align:start position:0%
more immediate uh
response

02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
response
 
02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:45.069 align:start position:0%
response
um

02:11:45.069 --> 02:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
then the next one was in
 
02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
18 we owe that to the on the tax cuts
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
and jobs act which gave a very large
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
amount of money to the corporations and
 
02:12:03.629 --> 02:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
the rich and richest people in the
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
country and on we were able to tax
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
it I think no other state had a business
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
profits tax the way we do that allowed
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
them to do as much of that and they they
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
also they don't
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
have uh very high corporate
 
02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:24.790 align:start position:0%
have uh very high corporate
taxes

02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:12:29.709 --> 02:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
um then um the next major increase was
 
02:12:32.189 --> 02:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
as we came out of the out of the worst
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.270 align:start position:0%
of the
pandemic

02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
um represent I'm sorry we're behind
 
02:12:40.639 --> 02:12:42.149 align:start position:0%
um represent I'm sorry we're behind
funds

02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
so so I just want to remind people that
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
we do have that that weight between when
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
the increase happens and the increase is
 
02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:57.189 align:start position:0%
the increase happens and the increase is
recorded

02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
here I was say something well we we're
 
02:13:03.629 --> 02:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
um almost 15 minutes behind so I want to
 
02:13:06.109 --> 02:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
move on we will have Dr back as I said
 
02:13:09.069 --> 02:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
we can and we'll also when we're doing

okay uh next we have uh the state
 
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness gracious we're getting
 
02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:10.430 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness gracious we're getting
Hightech

02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%

we can turn off the
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
um can we turn off the the
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:06.430 --> 02:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:11.229 --> 02:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
long as what's up there is here we
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.549 --> 02:16:17.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:20.069 --> 02:16:20.079 align:start position:0%

today I I will provide you with an
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
update of our our state of finances our
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
cash reserves and our ratings and
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
bonding so um as all of you know um the
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
state was um upgraded last year by one
 
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
of the rating agencies and I'm often
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
asked what contributed to to that
 
02:16:54.270 --> 02:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
upgrade so um I would like to um uh
 
02:16:56.429 --> 02:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
provide this presentation today um
 
02:16:59.309 --> 02:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
through that from that perspective um so
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
this this slide um really uh speaks to
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
the reasons uh the state was upgraded um
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
um we've the state um has benefited from
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
healthy economic conditions strong
 
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
financial management strong cash
 
02:17:17.070 --> 02:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
levels um so um the first component is
 
02:17:23.469 --> 02:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
is really how state has been our economy
 
02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
has been um very strong um I don't want
 
02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
to spend too much time on this SL
 
02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
because I know you you have experts
 
02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
coming and talking about uh the economy
 
02:17:34.429 --> 02:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
but um but just to highlight what really
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
takes part of of of the rating process
 
02:17:40.110 --> 02:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh the state really uh benefits from a
 
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
diverse economy diverse sectors um
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
sectors in technology Health Care
 
02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
education um the good news about being
 
02:17:50.190 --> 02:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
diverse is is one the one sector doesn't
 
02:17:52.589 --> 02:17:52.599 align:start position:0%
perform well than the others um uh do
 
02:17:55.309 --> 02:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
fine so that's uh the benefit of being
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
Diversified um so that's seen as a as a
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
positive um our aging population is
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
still a concern um but the state has
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
benefited from a population increase
 
02:18:10.589 --> 02:18:10.599 align:start position:0%
we've had about 2.3% increase since
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
2020 and um really what the um in in
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
that is our pacing compared to our
 
02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
neighbor States um so having a working
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh growing a working age population will
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
continue to boost our economy um and
 
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
again we've enjoyed um a robust economy
 
02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
with low unemployment uh High per capita
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
personal income and all of that is
 
02:18:34.910 --> 02:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
conducive to generate contribute to
 
02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
growth so the state has also um again
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
benefit from um all of us being part of
 
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
um manitary Finance as well um a strong
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
financial management um we've been able
 
02:18:53.790 --> 02:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
to provide balanced budgets uh we have
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
diverse uh Revenue sources we're able to
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
control our expenditures well we've been
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
able to add to our reserves all of that
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
has benefited the state so um what you
 
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
see um in this chart is um how revenues
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
have had a positive trend over the last
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
10 years except during the short period
 
02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
of um during the pandemic um the brief
 
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
um recession that we had um we also know
 
02:19:25.150 --> 02:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
that um if you look at 21 22 and 23 um
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment measures in 21 and a
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
conservative budget in 22 allow for a
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
sign significant Surplus um during the
 
02:19:36.669 --> 02:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
recovery and that um happen at the end
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
of that bium so with with that um
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
addition with those additional revenues
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
we've been able to um add funds to our
 
02:19:47.389 --> 02:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
rain day fund which is a key component
 
02:19:48.510 --> 02:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
of our credit
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
rating um in addition to state has been
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
able to um use in our Co fund Co funds
 
02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
and um the additional revenues um the
 
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
state has made key Investments um in in
 
02:20:02.590 --> 02:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
various sectors and housing uh water
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Broadband um again while
 
02:20:07.630 --> 02:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
being able to add more money to our
 
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
reserves all of that is all of these
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
Investments are key to continue boosting
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
our economy and that's what uh Mr Mike K
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
called the legislative specials in 20 in
 
02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
22 23 and 24 we've had additional
 
02:20:26.429 --> 02:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
Appropriations as you uh as you can see
 
02:20:29.550 --> 02:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
and um again all of those are uh very
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
good Investments for our state
 
02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
um again taking advantage of the
 
02:20:36.429 --> 02:20:36.439 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue that we have um
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
collected over the last few
 
02:20:41.389 --> 02:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
years so uh unfortunately as we just
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
heard our fiscal year 23 25 revenues are
 
02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
coming lower and plan and as you can see
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
that 2024 expenditures um are higher
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
than the previous Trend so um you know
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
um that's uh clearly a challenge for all
 
02:20:59.950 --> 02:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
of us to to try to um you know figured
 
02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
out how we're going to going to manage
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
that uh but uh also the rating agencies
 
02:21:08.590 --> 02:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
will will look at how we uh handle um
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
that in the short term and obviously in
 
02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
the L long term um they'll be watching
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
how we um plan for our YDC claims and
 
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
any additional pressures uh regarding da
 
02:21:23.550 --> 02:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
education funding uh and other uh
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
budgetary pressures for from other um
 
02:21:26.399 --> 02:21:28.190 align:start position:0%
budgetary pressures for from other um
social

02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
social
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
programs they'll also be watching to
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
um you know any plans that the state has
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
to replace um the revenues uh from the
 
02:21:40.510 --> 02:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend STX going forward
 
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
again right now we have uh revenues
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
lower than planned but we also um losing
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
a significant um source of
 
02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's on the general f side on
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund side um the
 
02:21:55.990 --> 02:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
only thing I would like to U mention
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
here is how um um the the education
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund obviously has had a positive
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
trend over the last uh 10 and five years
 
02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
particular um the education trust fund
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
has benefited from the outperformance in
 
02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
revenue and that has um which um we have
 
02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
been able to um have a positive uh fund
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
balance over the last few years if you
 
02:22:23.309 --> 02:22:23.319 align:start position:0%
look at uh 20 20 and 2021 um the green
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
bars Show additional expenditures likely
 
02:22:28.670 --> 02:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
those are Co expenditures and then and
 
02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:29.710 align:start position:0%
those are Co expenditures and then and
fisure

02:22:29.710 --> 02:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
fisure
 
02:22:33.230 --> 02:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
24 um the the funding formula uh changed
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
and and so that added additional funding
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
to um the education trust fund which was
 
02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
an increase of about 13 uh
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
133% again that's just a a a overall
 
02:22:47.349 --> 02:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
picture of our finances and how uh our
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
revenues and our expenditures have
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
performed um over the last 10 years um
 
02:22:56.830 --> 02:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.710 --> 02:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
that also the state has benefited from
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
um strong cash reserves uh clearly um
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
the um the fact that we've received
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
additional F funds and the additional
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue we've collected um changed the
 
02:23:13.710 --> 02:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
picture of our cash position um this is
 
02:23:17.389 --> 02:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
a bus slide um but um what I what I like
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
to highlight is um I like to include
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
year 20 in this and this SL which is the
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
yellow line in this chart and if you can
 
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
see uh if you see the beginning of the
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
FIS year um we were averaging about 8
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
800 million in our cash position and
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
then um with the additional revenue and
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
additional funding that we've received
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
over the last uh five years are or cash
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
position um increased in significantly
 
02:23:50.110 --> 02:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
um we reach um in FIS year 24 we reach
 
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
um the point of 2.8 billion in our
 
02:23:58.030 --> 02:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
funds so um our healthy our healthy cash
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
position uh coupled with higher interest
 
02:24:05.469 --> 02:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
rates uh we've been able to generate
 
02:24:07.790 --> 02:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
generate significant um investment
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
income we created 95 or 100 million to
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
the general fund in FIS year 24 um I
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
think it was about 65 and
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
23 um fiscal year 25 levels are are
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
lower and that's the Gray Line uh right
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
now as this current current information
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
is we have about 1.7 billion in our cash
 
02:24:33.469 --> 02:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
position um we are um about 15% less
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
compared to last year um which is the
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
effect of less revenues and and and
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
steady uh expenditures expenditures
 
02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
being a little bit higher um than again
 
02:24:45.630 --> 02:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
Trend um even with that um you know for
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
FIS year 25 we still anticipate about 80
 
02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
million in investment income but then
 
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
again in FIS year 26 27 the picture will
 
02:24:59.269 --> 02:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
change um you know we may we may have
 
02:25:01.710 --> 02:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
about half of what we're anticipating
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
this year um interest rates um will
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
eventually come down and normalize uh it
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like in this year they're
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to be drastically reduced um at
 
02:25:14.110 --> 02:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
least that's what uh we've been hearing
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
um but again eventually they will come
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
to a normal normal pace and the
 
02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
prediction is is is going to be about 3%
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
run the revenue stabilization account
 
02:25:32.670 --> 02:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
this is definitely a key component of
 
02:25:35.429 --> 02:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
our rating um as you can see we've been
 
02:25:38.349 --> 02:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
able to add um significant amounts over
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
the last few years again the additional
 
02:25:42.830 --> 02:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
revenues have contributed to adding the
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
Surplus to the rainy day fund
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
um the one the one thing I would like to
 
02:25:51.870 --> 02:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
um highlight uh to this SC is um the
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
really the the Rainy Define is really
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
what is called the revenue stabilization
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
account and and I'd like to uh emphasize
 
02:26:01.389 --> 02:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
that because um this is really the tool
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
the state has um in the event we have
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue show Falls or or projected
 
02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
deficit unfortunately it's not this is
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
not another fund or or a fund that we
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
can use for particular initiatives this
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
is a really important component of our
 
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
of our credit profile uh is seen by the
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
rating agenc is seen by our investors
 
02:26:25.269 --> 02:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
how much we're able to um again having
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
an emergency fund in the EV in events of
 
02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
again uh you know fiscal challenges and
 
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
again uh you know fiscal challenges and
economic

02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
economic
 
02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
downturns um so right now the
 
02:26:38.670 --> 02:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
2925 million that we have is about 7% of
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
the current capacity and the law says
 
02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
that we can have about we can have 10%
 
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
of revenues um of the last by Anum that
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
would be about 400 million if we wanted
 
02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
to reach that capacity and a couple of
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
points that I I want to make um you know
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
the the the median according to S&amp;P
 
02:27:00.429 --> 02:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
Global is 15% of Revenue so the states
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh hold that that amount and and another
 
02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
point that um our financial advisor um
 
02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
you know brings it to my my attention is
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
is the fact that moodies um uh when they
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
when they um review the state the state
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
scores really high um apparently we we
 
02:27:24.190 --> 02:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
get a score of a AAA rated um entity but
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
because they don't believe we have
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
enough money and in our reserves they
 
02:27:31.389 --> 02:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
remove a point from us so that's um you
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
know something to keep in mind how we
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
could one day be a triple R triple um
 
02:27:42.389 --> 02:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.910 --> 02:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
state I'm sorry we have one question on
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
that yes representative yeah thank you I
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
just want to understand the uh today's
 
02:27:53.550 --> 02:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
state are we AAA now or going to be AAA
 
02:27:56.030 --> 02:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's in one of the slides um
 
02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
but we are
 
02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
so the three and I'll jump to that
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
quickly uh so those are the ratings that
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
we have so um we are below AAA but we
 
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
are consider um investment grade um our
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
bonds are consider investment grade so
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh double A1 from Moody's uh
 
02:28:17.469 --> 02:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
doublea plus uh from Fitch and uh doua
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
plus um assessed by S&amp;P S&amp;P was the one
 
02:28:25.269 --> 02:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
that um upgraded us uh last year we were
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh doublea but now we're um uh doublea
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
plus with an a stable Lo and I and I'll
 
02:28:34.830 --> 02:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
talk about this um in a few
 
02:28:37.389 --> 02:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
minutes uh we it looks like we have a
 
02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
couple questions if it's all right sure
 
02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
um representa
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
ol when you're talking about the bound
 
02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
rting uh Madam
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
Treasurer it doesn't cost us anything at
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
a at a double a plus rating as opposed
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
to a AAA rating uh and that would it's
 
02:28:59.550 --> 02:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
only a few million dollars that would
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
change that into the reserve fund if I'm
 
02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
not mistaken
 
02:29:09.150 --> 02:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
so does it really make any difference to
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer in New
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes thank you for the question
 
02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
um you know again is the the have being
 
02:29:22.150 --> 02:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
a AAA uh rated entity um will be really
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
um um you know something to to be proud
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
of but but you're right um the current
 
02:29:30.750 --> 02:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
rating that we have allow us to um again
 
02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
still have um low cost borrowing um you
 
02:29:37.309 --> 02:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
know every we again it's it's just the
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
fact that investors um will be were more
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
attractive to them so they'll provide it
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
really is during our bond sales you know
 
02:29:46.429 --> 02:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
our our our bonds become more
 
02:29:48.110 --> 02:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
competitive so the more competitive we
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
are we receive lower cost um our yields
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
will be lower and we'll eventually pay
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
less for our debt service so um it
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
really does benefit again it's just um
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know just trying to have a better
 
02:30:03.790 --> 02:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
Financial uh picture um if we were a
 
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
triaa um rated um State uh we will
 
02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
definitely benefit from that um
 
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
represent Aly thank you um this also
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
benefits all of the municipalities and
 
02:30:20.910 --> 02:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
the counties correct
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
when they go out to bond yes
 
02:30:28.269 --> 02:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
um some of them go out to to um on their
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
own and others go through the municipal
 
02:30:32.590 --> 02:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
Bond Bank um the municipal Bond Bank
 
02:30:35.309 --> 02:30:35.319 align:start position:0%
benefits from our rating uh slightly so
 
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
I will say yes um uh not very directly
 
02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
but indirectly they're um they're
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
attached because of the um um I'm
 
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
forgetting the the the term right now
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
but but they're they're linked to us
 
02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
because we provide that guarantee thank
 
02:30:57.550 --> 02:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
you and what I want wanted to ask was uh
 
02:30:59.469 --> 02:30:59.479 align:start position:0%
what happened in
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
20 22 that cut our rainy day fund in
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
half I don't remember it yes um and so
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
that was uh the one time um reduction um
 
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
that was those funds were sent to or to
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
create the um the YDC settlement fund
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
that was a time when um we had again
 
02:31:27.710 --> 02:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
reserves and and it was a a a decision
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
um that money was um going to be used
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
from that fund and that's one of the
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
reason I mentioning the importance of
 
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund um you know we can
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
certainly um speak to to rating agencies
 
02:31:42.590 --> 02:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
and others um you know the reason why we
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
do you know make a decision like that
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
but um it is just not um recommended I
 
02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
should say again the day fund is there
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
for when we need it economic down terms
 
02:31:56.190 --> 02:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
come they do happen shortall Revenue
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
shortfalls as we can see you know right
 
02:32:00.269 --> 02:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
now revenues are coming below plan they
 
02:32:02.110 --> 02:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
do happen so we need to be prepared for
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
that and that's the tool we have
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
available represent shamberg thank you
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you madam Treasurer uh
 
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
just a quick
 
02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
question revenues that come in taxes
 
02:32:17.469 --> 02:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
that come in what do you invest in uh
 
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
the bond market the mutual funds or and
 
02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
the stabilization fund is it actual cash
 
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
or is it invested
 
02:32:28.110 --> 02:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
also yes thank you for the question we
 
02:32:32.110 --> 02:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
invest everything and um we do have
 
02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
investment policies for um our operating
 
02:32:36.990 --> 02:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
funds so they they behave differently
 
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
than the rainy day fund the rainy day
 
02:32:41.070 --> 02:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
fund is here to stay a little bit longer
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
so we invest in the same type of
 
02:32:45.790 --> 02:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
Investments but the rainy day fund has a
 
02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
a longer duration so we can um invest in
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
a in a in a different way but uh we we
 
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
do have our investment policy is is
 
02:32:57.389 --> 02:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
mainly fixed income us treasuries uh us
 
02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
feral agencies uh corporate bonds um
 
02:33:04.349 --> 02:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
anything that is um um investment grade
 
02:33:06.990 --> 02:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
investment um you know we have to ensure
 
02:33:09.150 --> 02:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
we we meet the objectives of first
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
safety liquidity and um try to um
 
02:33:16.030 --> 02:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
achieve uh a High um rate of
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
return representative om yeah thank you
 
02:33:21.269 --> 02:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
I have followup on the ratings and I
 
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
like wonder if you could give us a
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
comment on how the ratings affect our
 
02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
actual interest rates on long-term bonds
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
say triaa double a single a what kind of
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
a percent impact would that imply again
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
is is is really the the fact that right
 
02:33:39.469 --> 02:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
now we have um significant reserves that
 
02:33:41.269 --> 02:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
that is a is a good thing is is like
 
02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
having a significant cash our balance
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
sheet we that's so that's a positive for
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
the career rating um obviously all of it
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
together and I'll move to to De in a
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
minute but all of the components
 
02:33:55.710 --> 02:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
together allows us to to have a strong
 
02:33:58.269 --> 02:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
rating um if one of those components
 
02:34:00.670 --> 02:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
don't behave you know if if they don't
 
02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
act correctly for just for saying it
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
that way um obviously that could impact
 
02:34:12.269 --> 02:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:23.950 --> 02:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
so yes thank you for the question we do
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
have um everything that so we we we use
 
02:34:36.910 --> 02:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
our our all of our banks we have we do
 
02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:37.990 align:start position:0%
our our all of our banks we have we do
business

02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:34:41.550 --> 02:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
with most of the banks in New Hampshire
 
02:34:43.950 --> 02:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
um so the the larger banks that allow us
 
02:34:47.790 --> 02:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
to um um provide the services the
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
banking services we need um we do
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
business uh with with them and we and
 
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
and we maintain with them um right now
 
02:34:59.309 --> 02:34:59.319 align:start position:0%
again the the composition of the cash
 
02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
exchanging but we have about um um we
 
02:35:05.309 --> 02:35:05.319 align:start position:0%
have about 400 million with them right
 
02:35:08.230 --> 02:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
now um with our Community Banks we
 
02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
maintain a separate program where our
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
Community Banks and that is um we
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
started that uh in
 
02:35:18.429 --> 02:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
20120 um we have about 130 million with
 
02:35:21.230 --> 02:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
our Community Bank so that's I don't
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
have the percentage with me right now
 
02:35:26.469 --> 02:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
but it's about 130 million in
 
02:35:26.479 --> 02:35:28.230 align:start position:0%
but it's about 130 million in
in

02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
um again our are and so we've had that
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
for for a while um the way we are going
 
02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
to um um again now that our cashes the
 
02:35:40.990 --> 02:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
the the the cash is changing uh the
 
02:35:42.389 --> 02:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
composition of our cash is changing a
 
02:35:44.750 --> 02:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
little bit we may need to reduce some of
 
02:35:47.349 --> 02:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
those funds with those those Banks but
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
not not drastically I will say thank you
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
you're welcome Senator
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
Lang whole idea about B is that we have
 
02:35:59.950 --> 02:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
high cash avilability in our renate
 
02:36:02.910 --> 02:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
fund stabilization fund as well as
 
02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
having low debt um drives up our bond
 
02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
rating that Bond rating will help us
 
02:36:12.269 --> 02:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
with future bonds that by keeping our
 
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
our interest charge lower and theary to
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
that is that the municipalities also
 
02:36:18.429 --> 02:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
benefit from that by having lower
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal rates and which in the long
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
term means that we're paying less of
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
debt service and getting more value
 
02:36:28.349 --> 02:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:28.359 --> 02:36:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
02:36:34.269 --> 02:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
um so so speaking of that I can move to
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
we'll move on if that's if that's okay
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
um I'll move just to to our debt levels
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
again we we do have um we're very
 
02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
conservative when it comes to that um we
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
benefit from again having a low low de
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
burden um the the rating agencies also
 
02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
evaluate our pension and a
 
02:36:55.230 --> 02:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
post-employment benefit uh liability but
 
02:36:57.670 --> 02:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
I I'll speak uh to that in a moment um
 
02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
so if you look at this chart um the
 
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
again the trend and you can see our our
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
debt levels have decreased over the last
 
02:37:10.469 --> 02:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
few years um the blue line is uh our net
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
net tax support debt which is debt repay
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
with General funds and right now it's
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
about 500 million um the rating agency
 
02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
is also look at our pens our pension um
 
02:37:23.710 --> 02:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
liability and our post-employment
 
02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
benefits liability um they don't
 
02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
um as being um too low but um the rating
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
agencies uh feel comfortable with u the
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
plan New Hampshire has um the fact that
 
02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
we are going to um there's a plan to
 
02:37:44.190 --> 02:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
repay the unfunded liability uh in 14
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
years um our funding ratio is increasing
 
02:37:49.269 --> 02:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
and we obviously have more assets and
 
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
the trust fund the portion related to
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is only uh um about a
 
02:37:56.990 --> 02:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollars compared to the five
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
billion that the entire unfunded
 
02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
liability um you know the the total
 
02:38:04.750 --> 02:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability the portion of the
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
state is just 1 billion so that's
 
02:38:09.790 --> 02:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
considered and and and and used as part
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
of our you know again the evaluation of
 
02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
our state's um debt
 
02:38:17.550 --> 02:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
burden um the next the next page is uh
 
02:38:19.950 --> 02:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
is really just a summary of our Deb
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
affordability study um I just um issued
 
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
the Deb affordability study on Friday
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to be posted uh online
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
sometime today um and I don't that I
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't intend to spend a lot of time um
 
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
on this I'll be happy to spend time with
 
02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
with anyone who's interested in in in
 
02:38:38.750 --> 02:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
seeing the calculations behind the data
 
02:38:41.550 --> 02:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
affability study but um essentially we
 
02:38:44.429 --> 02:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
calculate date ratios uh for our current
 
02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um 24 and right now is
 
02:38:51.070 --> 02:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
3.8% um and we also project those ratios
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
using various assumptions um and and and
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
and um and again we we we we uh report
 
02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
that in this study uh the good news is
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
that our current and our projected
 
02:39:05.710 --> 02:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
ratios again using this assumptions are
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
below the medians and you can see on the
 
02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
on the right column um the
 
02:39:13.830 --> 02:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
medians uh from moodies and and the debt
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
to revenue rati which is one of is the
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
key debt metric uh from S&amp;P is three
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
88% um again um I think and this again I
 
02:39:26.269 --> 02:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
don't intend to spend too much time on
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
this um the the reason you see an
 
02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
increase um um in 25 26 27 28 is due to
 
02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
the additional bonding authorization
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
that was authorized um in during the 24
 
02:39:47.550 --> 02:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
Corrections and slide again these are
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
ratings the only thing I'm going to um
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
mention um related to to the ratings is
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
the stable Outlook um this is just um
 
02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know what this means is really the
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
rating agencies believe that we will
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
continue um the way the state has been
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
performing um you know over the for
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future the fact that we have
 
02:40:18.670 --> 02:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
less revenues and and and you know right
 
02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
now is is it's not a big concern um they
 
02:40:23.269 --> 02:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
believe we're going to be able to manage
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
the situation and and continue to add um
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
again the promise to continue to add
 
02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
funds to our reserves if we have to use
 
02:40:34.910 --> 02:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
um funds from the reated fund to to
 
02:40:37.710 --> 02:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps balance our our fiscal uh
 
02:40:39.870 --> 02:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
condition um they will I'm sure they'll
 
02:40:42.190 --> 02:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
be looking at you know how how soon
 
02:40:43.750 --> 02:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to replace those funds and
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
build up those those reserves again it's
 
02:40:50.590 --> 02:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
just Again part of the overall equation
 
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
um in the last page I included just key
 
02:40:56.349 --> 02:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
takeaways um again you know the the idea
 
02:40:59.070 --> 02:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
of the rainy day fund being a a tool for
 
02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
the State uh in the event of a potential
 
02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
deficit um perhaps the state may need to
 
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
um Implement some Cost Containment
 
02:41:11.070 --> 02:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
measures and make um budget adjustments
 
02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
this year is unclear right now um you
 
02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
know um you know the governor's uh plan
 
02:41:18.429 --> 02:41:18.439 align:start position:0%
right now but that could be a
 
02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
possibility or a tool to be able to um
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
um you know finish the year uh with a
 
02:41:26.030 --> 02:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
balanced budget uh something I didn't
 
02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
mention before but um additional Bond
 
02:41:30.630 --> 02:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
and authorizations may not impact our
 
02:41:32.389 --> 02:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
debt metrics just because our our
 
02:41:35.150 --> 02:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
metrics are low and below the medians
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
but that will definitely increase uh the
 
02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
fixed cost The Debt Service and it will
 
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
impact um um our operating budget and
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
again um you know having diverse Revenue
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
um sources uh should continue to provide
 
02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:49.830 align:start position:0%
um sources uh should continue to provide
adequate

02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
02:41:52.349 --> 02:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
um protection during fiscal challenges
 
02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
economics just thinking about how when
 
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
for example if the business taxes
 
02:41:59.070 --> 02:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't the business taxes don't perform
 
02:42:01.349 --> 02:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
well uh but we have the meals and room
 
02:42:04.110 --> 02:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
tax performing um well when you know
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
when one doesn't um you know is not um
 
02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
performing as expected so again the idea
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
of having a um a
 
02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:13.429 align:start position:0%
of having a um a
diversified

02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
diversified
 
02:42:16.510 --> 02:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
um you know basket is is important in
 
02:42:18.830 --> 02:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
the state benefits uh from from that
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
compared to all states that rely on a
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
sales tax and an income tax so that
 
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I have for my presentation
 
02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer additional
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I'm I'm going to
 
02:42:31.269 --> 02:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
just uh take a couple more questions
 
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
then we'll move on to the last speaker
 
02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
represent ol uh thank you madam
 
02:42:40.030 --> 02:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
the percentage of change seems or
 
02:42:41.950 --> 02:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
02:42:44.309 --> 02:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh debt
 
02:42:47.349 --> 02:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
burden seems to be relatively stable at
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
around 0.5% over a variety of years
 
02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
using the percentage which would balance
 
02:42:57.070 --> 02:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
out the inflate inflation values of the
 
02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
dollar are we running in that same area
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
or are we running in an upward
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
cycle I think what I will say to the to
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
the rages um it it really does it really
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
inflation except for the fact that um
 
02:43:13.870 --> 02:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
you know the yields may change due to
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
inflation um what really um the
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
consistency in our debt burden really um
 
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
stems from the fact that we in in in a
 
02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
this question is asked often you know we
 
02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
typically recommend about 120 billion of
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
bonding um praid with General funds in
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
for every by Anum and the reason we do
 
02:43:39.070 --> 02:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
that is because we like to uh continue
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
to recommend that amount so you can see
 
02:43:43.870 --> 02:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
how the revenue how the the metrics
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
change over time we can we can control
 
02:43:49.830 --> 02:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
our our amount of bonding but we can't
 
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
control how revenues perform and so um
 
02:43:55.389 --> 02:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
that you know continue to be
 
02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
conservative in the way we Bond will
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
allow us to maintain those metrics low
 
02:44:03.710 --> 02:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
and again if the revenues the revenues
 
02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
have decreased significantly over the
 
02:44:07.389 --> 02:44:07.399 align:start position:0%
last few years because of the revenues
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
we' have collected but again if that
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
changes and normalizes we may see the
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
metrics um increase but again we're
 
02:44:15.950 --> 02:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
still below the medians we're still
 
02:44:18.670 --> 02:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
below what is you know 10% is considered
 
02:44:20.670 --> 02:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
a war inside is something we will never
 
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
want to reach if that helps um with your
 
02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you mam treasure
 
02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:27.870 align:start position:0%
question thank you mam treasure
appreciate

02:44:27.870 --> 02:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:29.790 align:start position:0%
appreciate
it

02:44:29.790 --> 02:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes treasure um on your last slide
 
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
you you talked about um additional
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
bonding authorizations may not
 
02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:39.269 align:start position:0%
bonding authorizations may not
signicantly

02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:39.279 align:start position:0%
signicantly
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
impact any sense as to how much
 
02:44:50.510 --> 02:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:52.349 --> 02:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
we need to speak into your microphone
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
microphone right can you repeat sure and
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
and I believe the question relates to
 
02:45:01.230 --> 02:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
how much more we can Bond yes exactly so
 
02:45:04.150 --> 02:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
I I think um again I've been asked this
 
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
question U over the years uh I think we
 
02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
can C we can definitely take an
 
02:45:13.910 --> 02:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
additional debt we can we we have um I
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how much because it
 
02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
really depends on how much that's more
 
02:45:20.990 --> 02:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
Debt Service we want to pay over time
 
02:45:23.950 --> 02:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
and we and I can certainly uh I could
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
calculate those differences but really
 
02:45:28.910 --> 02:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
the impact is on the impact is on the
 
02:45:31.309 --> 02:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
operating budget um the additional Debt
 
02:45:33.750 --> 02:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
Service that the state will have to pay
 
02:45:36.429 --> 02:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to bond more um that's
 
02:45:38.110 --> 02:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
really the answer the state could take
 
02:45:41.469 --> 02:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
on more um again the ratio is is is is
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
really um low you know close to uh 4%
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
but it's not um but again it's it's
 
02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
really you know adding
 
02:45:51.950 --> 02:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
a fixed cost to your parting budget
 
02:45:54.309 --> 02:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
something that U you know something to
 
02:45:54.319 --> 02:45:55.990 align:start position:0%
something that U you know something to
think

02:45:55.990 --> 02:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.389 align:start position:0%
think
about

02:45:58.389 --> 02:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:46:08.070 --> 02:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:12.389 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:46:12.389 --> 02:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
no okay we are on to our last speaker of
 
02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:16.630 align:start position:0%
no okay we are on to our last speaker of
the

02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:46:32.110 --> 02:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
it could we you're not going to have
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
slides right sorry if you don't have
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
slides we could
 
02:46:57.309 --> 02:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.670 --> 02:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:09.070 --> 02:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
paper the other
 
02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:45.950 align:start position:0%
 
challenge

02:47:45.950 --> 02:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I thought we had sent over
 
02:48:03.870 --> 02:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
those are
 
02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:39.910 align:start position:0%
those are
extras

02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
extras
 
02:48:42.349 --> 02:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I think we can get started
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you okay good thank you um again
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Taylor Caswell I am the
 
02:48:48.030 --> 02:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
 
02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
Business and econom iic Affairs um we'll
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
move through this slide deck I think
 
02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
really the role of this department has
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
been to actively promote both the
 
02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
economy of the state but that includes
 
02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism that includes uh
 
02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
finding opportunities to provide impact
 
02:49:09.389 --> 02:49:09.399 align:start position:0%
on key foundational issues to businesses
 
02:49:11.469 --> 02:49:11.479 align:start position:0%
and municipalities in the state of New
 
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have been now in existence
 
02:49:16.510 --> 02:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
since 2017 and I think over the last
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
several years we have uh really
 
02:49:22.030 --> 02:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
established an important role to be able
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
to provide these types of services to
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
and and do it in a series of
 
02:49:29.830 --> 02:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with existing
 
02:49:31.950 --> 02:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities Chambers of Commerce
 
02:49:33.389 --> 02:49:33.399 align:start position:0%
Regional planning commissions Regional
 
02:49:34.830 --> 02:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
development commissions and so on around
 
02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
the state uh to advance the economy of
 
02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um it it says here in our
 
02:49:43.630 --> 02:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
first slide we do have three divisions
 
02:49:45.550 --> 02:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
our division of Economic Development we
 
02:49:47.349 --> 02:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
have a division for planning and
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
Community Development and then we have a
 
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
separate division that handles all of
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
the state's tourism and Hospitality
 
02:49:55.389 --> 02:49:55.399 align:start position:0%
promotional activities so I'll touch on
 
02:49:58.830 --> 02:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
all of those things on slide three um
 
02:50:01.790 --> 02:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
you know we often see a lot of these
 
02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
rankings um come across our desk on a
 
02:50:08.830 --> 02:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
regular basis the best this best that um
 
02:50:10.910 --> 02:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is clickbait a lot of it is
 
02:50:12.269 --> 02:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
just getting people to sort of run
 
02:50:14.349 --> 02:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
through a bunch of pictures on a website
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
but this particular one I like to point
 
02:50:20.269 --> 02:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
out which is the number one ranking for
 
02:50:22.910 --> 02:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
economic freedom this is done by an
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
organization called The Frasier
 
02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
Institute and they spend an enormous
 
02:50:29.469 --> 02:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
amount of effort to come to this
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion it isn't just something that
 
02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
they took a survey online these this is
 
02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
based in data uh and in fact they do
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
this for States within the United States
 
02:50:41.790 --> 02:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
but they also rank Nations and uh across
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
across the globe so um it is one that we
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
do pay attention to uh there's a lot
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
that we don't pay attention to um and uh
 
02:50:54.030 --> 02:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
this this particular ranking we have
 
02:50:56.990 --> 02:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
held now for two years in a row and for
 
02:50:58.830 --> 02:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
the previous two years before that we
 
02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
were number two uh Florida was number
 
02:51:03.990 --> 02:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
one so we've overtaken them um
 
02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
thankfully uh so I do like to point that
 
02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
out um slide four on housing this is the
 
02:51:14.229 --> 02:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
singal most challenging in uh issue for
 
02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
our state's economy in the private
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
sector as we speak
 
02:51:21.790 --> 02:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
we all I am sure have heard the stories
 
02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
about the lack of affordable housing in
 
02:51:27.389 --> 02:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lack of really most
 
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
housing in general um there have been
 
02:51:32.630 --> 02:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
numerous studies that have been
 
02:51:35.790 --> 02:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
undertaken to sort of gauge the scale of
 
02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
this issue the scale is significant uh
 
02:51:42.550 --> 02:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
Bea early uh well let's just say maybe
 
02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
2022 I believe we uh contracted with the
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
state's Regional planning commissions to
 
02:51:51.790 --> 02:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
do a series of Regional Housing needs
 
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
assessments all at the same time to get
 
02:51:56.670 --> 02:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
a snapshot as to where we felt that the
 
02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
need is on a local level across the
 
02:52:02.110 --> 02:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
state and that began the numbers that we
 
02:52:04.190 --> 02:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
have now seen a steady stream of both
 
02:52:06.110 --> 02:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
from the planning commissions themselves
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
and from New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
Authority that put the scale at tens of
 
02:52:12.670 --> 02:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
thousands of units that we need to be
 
02:52:14.830 --> 02:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
able to be BR online to meet the need
 
02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
and the demand that uh we definitely are
 
02:52:19.870 --> 02:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
seeing out there and address the the
 
02:52:23.229 --> 02:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
cost issues so one of the tools that we
 
02:52:25.630 --> 02:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
brought to the table um beginning in
 
02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
2022 using uh the arpa funds that were
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
provided was what we call the invest NH
 
02:52:35.429 --> 02:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
program this was uh and you'll see um a
 
02:52:39.269 --> 02:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
map on Slide Five where uh we were able
 
02:52:40.990 --> 02:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
to make some fairly significant
 
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
investments in uh the issues surrounding
 
02:52:47.389 --> 02:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
affordable housing uh Statewide uh the
 
02:52:49.870 --> 02:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
the the the the fund in a very sort of
 
02:52:52.950 --> 02:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
um uh basic overview was divided into
 
02:52:57.670 --> 02:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
two um primary areas one was to help
 
02:53:00.550 --> 02:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
with the ability to expand and
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
accelerate uh the uh access to
 
02:53:05.309 --> 02:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
affordable housing with nonprofit and
 
02:53:09.070 --> 02:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
for-profit developers uh that program uh
 
02:53:11.710 --> 02:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
which is just wrapping up now um
 
02:53:15.670 --> 02:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
invested close to $60 million into
 
02:53:18.510 --> 02:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
existing projects that were just about
 
02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
ready to be completed but they needed to
 
02:53:22.349 --> 02:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
get over the line quickly these are
 
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
multifam units that have an
 
02:53:28.349 --> 02:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
affordability component to it uh these
 
02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
Investments were judged at the time as
 
02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
being the highest and best use of these
 
02:53:36.429 --> 02:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
funds because we really needed to see
 
02:53:39.190 --> 02:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
more units come online in New Hampshire
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh as quickly as we could the remaining
 
02:53:43.830 --> 02:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
part of the invest in age fund really
 
02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
went directly to our municipalities to
 
02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
help them uh a deal with the number of
 
02:53:50.990 --> 02:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
challenges that they were seeing on
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
their side so we had a per unit um uh
 
02:53:57.790 --> 02:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
grant program where if municipalities
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
were U uh permitting affordable housing
 
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
at a certain level uh there was a
 
02:54:06.349 --> 02:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per unit grant that they became
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
eligible for and that was an extremely
 
02:54:10.309 --> 02:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
popular program it was used for a
 
02:54:11.950 --> 02:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
multitude of different purposes many
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
communities used that to uh invest back
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the project itself but many other
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
communities used that to deal with
 
02:54:19.229 --> 02:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure challenges and other
 
02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
things that sometimes come when you make
 
02:54:23.790 --> 02:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
those types of Investments uh we also
 
02:54:26.510 --> 02:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
had programs around demolition uh that
 
02:54:30.190 --> 02:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
helped communities um find uh
 
02:54:32.750 --> 02:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities for new uh sites to build
 
02:54:35.190 --> 02:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
affordable housing by uh clearing out
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
some maybe some older stock housing um
 
02:54:40.190 --> 02:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and that program actually was far
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
more successful than I had anticipated
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh and the last piece of this I I I
 
02:54:46.670 --> 02:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
point out was called our housing
 
02:54:49.670 --> 02:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities program this was a grant
 
02:54:51.710 --> 02:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh a grant program available again for
 
02:54:54.349 --> 02:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities who were interested in
 
02:54:56.510 --> 02:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
understanding what their options were to
 
02:54:57.990 --> 02:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
address the housing crisis in their
 
02:55:00.190 --> 02:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
community at the level that they felt
 
02:55:02.670 --> 02:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
was appropriate for them uh this has
 
02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
been an highly successful program and
 
02:55:07.110 --> 02:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
one that we have been continuing to uh
 
02:55:08.670 --> 02:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
work with our friends at New Hampshire
 
02:55:11.550 --> 02:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority to advance but
 
02:55:14.830 --> 02:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
this is uh often some I refer to this as
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
working with the communities of the
 
02:55:18.150 --> 02:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
Willing so communities that are saying
 
02:55:20.309 --> 02:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
yes yes ra we'll raise our hand and say
 
02:55:22.110 --> 02:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
we we're willing to look at this we're
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
willing to take a look and understand
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
what are the options that we have as our
 
02:55:28.590 --> 02:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
community to help address this issue at
 
02:55:30.990 --> 02:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
a scale that meets the needs and really
 
02:55:33.150 --> 02:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
the expectations of our community and
 
02:55:34.670 --> 02:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
this program has been very successful
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it's given us an opportunity to have
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
that discussion rather than have it be
 
02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
when someone shows up uh having just
 
02:55:44.750 --> 02:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
purchased Farmer Brown's field in uh in
 
02:55:46.990 --> 02:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
their Community uh and they show up at a
 
02:55:48.030 --> 02:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
planning board meeting and say we're
 
02:55:50.510 --> 02:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
going to put 75 units there and that as
 
02:55:52.429 --> 02:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
you can imagine does not always go over
 
02:55:54.389 --> 02:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
very well but if there's an opportunity
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
to talk about that way before that
 
02:55:58.670 --> 02:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
developer shows up that I think is a
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
successful strategy and one that we have
 
02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
been pursuing using the invest in ag
 
02:56:04.990 --> 02:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
program I will say before I leave this
 
02:56:09.110 --> 02:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
subject that in addition we have uh also
 
02:56:11.670 --> 02:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature uh last year passed
 
02:56:14.590 --> 02:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
the housing Champions program uh this is
 
02:56:16.590 --> 02:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
a program where we're able to work with
 
02:56:19.429 --> 02:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities to self identify as a
 
02:56:22.030 --> 02:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
community that applies for and receives
 
02:56:24.790 --> 02:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
a designation uh as a housing champion
 
02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
and with that designation comes access
 
02:56:31.870 --> 02:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
to some resources uh and Grant funds um
 
02:56:34.269 --> 02:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
we just announced I think it was about
 
02:56:36.550 --> 02:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago right before Christmas
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh about 18 communities in our first
 
02:56:41.710 --> 02:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
round uh applied for and received that
 
02:56:44.469 --> 02:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
that designation so uh there will be
 
02:56:46.389 --> 02:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
some funds that will be available mostly
 
02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure for those communities
 
02:56:50.389 --> 02:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh it's about it's around about $5
 
02:56:53.070 --> 02:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
million uh total that would be available
 
02:56:54.469 --> 02:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
and for any of us who have anything to
 
02:56:56.349 --> 02:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
do with housing you know that's probably
 
02:56:59.309 --> 02:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
going to go pretty quickly um but uh
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's just another resource that we're
 
02:57:03.150 --> 02:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
continuing to work with to try to
 
02:57:06.630 --> 02:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
advance on this very important issue um
 
02:57:10.590 --> 02:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
moving to uh I guess it's slide six um
 
02:57:12.190 --> 02:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
another foundational investment that I
 
02:57:14.910 --> 02:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise for all of you today is
 
02:57:17.269 --> 02:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
the issue of high-speed internet access
 
02:57:19.349 --> 02:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
this is something that has been sort of
 
02:57:22.190 --> 02:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
lingering in the on the outskirts of
 
02:57:23.790 --> 02:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
economic discussions around the state
 
02:57:26.349 --> 02:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
for quite some time there still as of
 
02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
2022 remain a number of communities that
 
02:57:31.950 --> 02:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
had very limited or no access to
 
02:57:34.229 --> 02:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
high-speed internet and as we saw
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
particularly highlighted during the
 
02:57:38.110 --> 02:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
during the covid pandemic this is a
 
02:57:40.910 --> 02:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
critical issue the ability to people for
 
02:57:43.510 --> 02:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
people to basically execute on their
 
02:57:46.590 --> 02:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
daily uh daily living uh whether it's
 
02:57:48.750 --> 02:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
handing Financial matter whether it's
 
02:57:50.910 --> 02:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
kids going to school or whether it's
 
02:57:52.349 --> 02:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
just you know sitting down and relaxing
 
02:57:54.429 --> 02:57:54.439 align:start position:0%
and watching Netflix for the evening
 
02:57:56.990 --> 02:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
these are important pieces that impact
 
02:57:59.110 --> 02:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
property value that impact the ability
 
02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
for small towns and Main Street uh
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
around the state to be able to be
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
competitive in an international
 
02:58:07.150 --> 02:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
marketplace um this was another place
 
02:58:09.950 --> 02:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
where we saw some funds that came uh in
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
the co recovery that we quickly deployed
 
02:58:15.110 --> 02:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
and got resources on the ground to
 
02:58:17.670 --> 02:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
communities to help them uh achieve the
 
02:58:20.309 --> 02:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
goal of 100% access to high-speed
 
02:58:22.830 --> 02:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
internet and this slide and the slide
 
02:58:25.710 --> 02:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
after it have two maps that begin to
 
02:58:28.269 --> 02:58:28.279 align:start position:0%
show the the progress that we have made
 
02:58:30.469 --> 02:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
and we are about halfway through the
 
02:58:33.229 --> 02:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
process at this stage where um you know
 
02:58:35.389 --> 02:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
you can see a lot a lot of white there
 
02:58:37.950 --> 02:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
particularly in the North Country um in
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
2022 and we have begun to very seriously
 
02:58:44.309 --> 02:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
eat away at that um as we have gone over
 
02:58:46.870 --> 02:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
the last two years we expect to be
 
02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.469 --> 02:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
2027 um another important and now I'm on
 
02:58:59.630 --> 02:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
slide 8 uh uh component is the the
 
02:59:01.870 --> 02:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
investment of the businesses in the
 
02:59:04.469 --> 02:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
state economy so Capital expenditures
 
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
since covid now we are able to track in
 
02:59:09.190 --> 02:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
excess of a billion dollars of capital
 
02:59:11.469 --> 02:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
expenditures by businesses either moving
 
02:59:14.750 --> 02:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
here or expanding uh their operations in
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is a pretty
 
02:59:17.750 --> 02:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
significant number and that's again only
 
02:59:20.630 --> 02:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
since 2020 and and and I would say that
 
02:59:22.830 --> 02:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
it is probably not the entire number
 
02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of business that
 
02:59:26.510 --> 02:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
are expanding and coming to New
 
02:59:28.910 --> 02:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are just making that
 
02:59:31.030 --> 02:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
happen they are not uh necessarily one
 
02:59:32.990 --> 02:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
that we might have an interaction with
 
02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
but of those that we do and those are
 
02:59:37.389 --> 02:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
the major projects uh we are in excess
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
of of a billion dollars um another
 
02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
component of this that I put here is
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
what we're calling the New Hampshire
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
business Gateway uh for those of you
 
02:59:49.030 --> 02:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
who've been at this for a bit you'll
 
02:59:50.830 --> 02:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
recall that we've been trying for years
 
02:59:54.070 --> 02:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
to get a One-Stop digital platform for
 
02:59:57.070 --> 02:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
the State uh and for businesses to be
 
02:59:59.550 --> 02:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
able to legitimately access all state
 
03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
functions from one place uh we have used
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
the arpa funds uh to get us to that
 
03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
point this is an investment of $10
 
03:00:10.630 --> 03:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
million in those funds to a long-term
 
03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
solution for this issue and uh we are
 
03:00:16.070 --> 03:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
quite a ways along in making this come
 
03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
to fruition I expect we will see early
 
03:00:19.750 --> 03:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
versions of this in the next couple of
 
03:00:22.389 --> 03:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
months but this will be a tool that
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to build on over time and
 
03:00:27.150 --> 03:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
it will be again a place where a small
 
03:00:29.389 --> 03:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
business can find a place to add add
 
03:00:32.349 --> 03:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
additional investment a startup can go
 
03:00:34.429 --> 03:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
and get the the the components that they
 
03:00:36.910 --> 03:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
need to start their business or we can
 
03:00:39.429 --> 03:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
work with existing medium and large
 
03:00:41.429 --> 03:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
scale businesses to be able to do their
 
03:00:43.990 --> 03:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
business with the state again from one
 
03:00:47.670 --> 03:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
place I would point out one thing I know
 
03:00:49.710 --> 03:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's hard to see on this picture but
 
03:00:53.309 --> 03:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
the photograph on um page eight there on
 
03:00:56.190 --> 03:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
that slide deck that is taken from
 
03:00:58.750 --> 03:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
inside the new life is good Warehouse in
 
03:01:01.870 --> 03:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
Hudson New Hampshire this is a a half
 
03:01:05.950 --> 03:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
million square foot Warehouse that uh
 
03:01:08.590 --> 03:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
they invested in in last year
 
03:01:10.630 --> 03:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
consolidating several other locations
 
03:01:12.870 --> 03:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
including some in Massachusetts into
 
03:01:16.349 --> 03:01:16.359 align:start position:0%
this facility um those shelving units
 
03:01:18.670 --> 03:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
that you see in that photograph all sit
 
03:01:22.150 --> 03:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
on top of little robots and their entire
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
inventory moves and uh around based on
 
03:01:27.910 --> 03:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh what the needs and what the orders
 
03:01:30.150 --> 03:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
are at any given moment in time it is
 
03:01:32.990 --> 03:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
one of the more technologically advanced
 
03:01:35.670 --> 03:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
facilities we have in New Hampshire and
 
03:01:38.229 --> 03:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh they they do make t-shirts and mugs
 
03:01:40.030 --> 03:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
and other things but that's a lot of
 
03:01:42.110 --> 03:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
stuff to keep track of and this is a
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
signif one last thing on this if you'll
 
03:01:46.630 --> 03:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
indulge me for one moment when when they
 
03:01:48.469 --> 03:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
made this investment
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to put this facility in New
 
03:01:54.910 --> 03:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that enabled them to resore
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
all of the operations that they had been
 
03:01:59.550 --> 03:01:59.560 align:start position:0%
previously doing to uh manage their
 
03:02:02.710 --> 03:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
Logistics and inventory in Peru they
 
03:02:04.870 --> 03:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
closed those facilities and moved
 
03:02:06.910 --> 03:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
everything back to New Hampshire due to
 
03:02:10.349 --> 03:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
the ability to use technology and uh
 
03:02:13.269 --> 03:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
have it all in one location um it's an
 
03:02:15.630 --> 03:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
interesting fact because it does speak
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
to the impact of technology
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
and artificial intelligence as we begin
 
03:02:23.190 --> 03:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
to see those types of Investments even
 
03:02:26.190 --> 03:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
in things like Logistics
 
03:02:30.990 --> 03:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
centers uh the next slide is uh uh on
 
03:02:32.590 --> 03:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
International Trade I put this here I
 
03:02:33.510 --> 03:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
won't run through all of these
 
03:02:35.349 --> 03:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
statistics I put this here because this
 
03:02:37.269 --> 03:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
is something I wanted to make sure
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's aware of since 2017 the
 
03:02:43.229 --> 03:02:43.239 align:start position:0%
state has set a new record each year in
 
03:02:46.870 --> 03:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
export volume and this is a a trend that
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
is you know not not just a blip but it
 
03:02:51.150 --> 03:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
is a consistent Trend that we are seeing
 
03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
one that we have latched on to and that
 
03:02:54.590 --> 03:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
we have staff that work very
 
03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
deliberately and closely particularly
 
03:02:58.269 --> 03:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
with small and medium-sized businesses
 
03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
as they continue to expand they've had
 
03:03:02.510 --> 03:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
the need to find new markets and those
 
03:03:04.429 --> 03:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
markets are increasingly located
 
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
internationally uh so our our staff and
 
03:03:08.590 --> 03:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
our department is able to work with
 
03:03:11.070 --> 03:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
those businesses to identify where their
 
03:03:13.269 --> 03:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
B where their products are most
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
applicable or where there is a most need
 
03:03:17.030 --> 03:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then and then work with them to be
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
able to access those markets and that
 
03:03:20.590 --> 03:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
has been a very successful strategy and
 
03:03:22.229 --> 03:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
something that I just also wanted to
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
point out as a revenue generating
 
03:03:28.229 --> 03:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
activity um there's a quick slide here
 
03:03:29.910 --> 03:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
on some of the reports and strategies I
 
03:03:31.830 --> 03:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
put this here for your benefit if any of
 
03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
these are such that you want to see that
 
03:03:35.110 --> 03:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
we have them on our website if you would
 
03:03:37.349 --> 03:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
like to have them um I can get them to
 
03:03:40.190 --> 03:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
you but there over the past two years we
 
03:03:43.590 --> 03:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
have made some significant investment in
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
understanding particularly these types
 
03:03:47.030 --> 03:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
of markets because they are Central to
 
03:03:48.429 --> 03:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
the work that we do
 
03:03:49.950 --> 03:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh at the top of that list is
 
03:03:52.429 --> 03:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and advanced manufacturing
 
03:03:54.550 --> 03:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
there is tremendous opportunity right
 
03:03:56.950 --> 03:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
now in New Hampshire to take advantage
 
03:03:59.150 --> 03:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
of a trajectory that we have seen now
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
for several years in a row where there
 
03:04:02.950 --> 03:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
is a significant Resurgence in the
 
03:04:05.309 --> 03:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturing space in New Hampshire and
 
03:04:07.110 --> 03:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
for all of you who know about the
 
03:04:09.910 --> 03:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
economics of uh of different types of
 
03:04:12.469 --> 03:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
sectors the resiliency of a
 
03:04:14.910 --> 03:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing uh base is one that we
 
03:04:18.870 --> 03:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
would seek uh um uh treasur metp spoke
 
03:04:21.910 --> 03:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
to the diversity of our economy that is
 
03:04:23.950 --> 03:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
definitely the case and it is definitely
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
the case within the manufacturing
 
03:04:29.070 --> 03:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
facility we have everything from making
 
03:04:32.190 --> 03:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
pieces that go into cars to 3D printing
 
03:04:34.950 --> 03:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
lungs in Manchester so there is a
 
03:04:37.309 --> 03:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
diversity that exists there and there's
 
03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
a number of challenges that go with that
 
03:04:40.830 --> 03:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
but those are challenges that I am happy
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
to under to take on because they are
 
03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
challenges that come from a healthy
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
economy the next slide speaks to some of
 
03:04:50.910 --> 03:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
those uh outcomes uh I'll leave those
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
for you to uh to consider again if there
 
03:04:55.110 --> 03:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
are issues or questions you'd like me to
 
03:04:59.150 --> 03:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
discuss I'm happy to do that um so again
 
03:05:00.269 --> 03:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
some of the themes that I've been
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
talking about here on slide 12 um uh the
 
03:05:05.870 --> 03:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
recruitment of of workers continues to
 
03:05:08.670 --> 03:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
be an important component of what we do
 
03:05:10.389 --> 03:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh we we do combine that with our
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
tourism activity which I'll speak to
 
03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
very briefly here just after this um the
 
03:05:17.910 --> 03:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
collaborative uh uh Partnerships that we
 
03:05:20.510 --> 03:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
have and of course job training and and
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
education is critical uh let's see slide
 
03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
13 I I I put this photo in here this is
 
03:05:29.950 --> 03:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
a this is a pretty pretty good
 
03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
photograph we had a a billboard of this
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
in Boston last winter uh for any of you
 
03:05:38.870 --> 03:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
who saw it it was right there on on
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
Interstate 93 it didn't say it had you
 
03:05:43.309 --> 03:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
know obviously a different slogan there
 
03:05:47.790 --> 03:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
but uh this generated somewhere between
 
03:05:50.190 --> 03:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know about 10 and 15 calls to
 
03:05:51.990 --> 03:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
our department to people who were
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
accusing us of using photography from
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
places that were not in New
 
03:06:00.349 --> 03:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh of course this is very
 
03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
much in New Hampshire and it is
 
03:06:04.229 --> 03:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
something uh it's Tuckerman Ravine in at
 
03:06:08.190 --> 03:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington uh and uh but it had uh
 
03:06:10.030 --> 03:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
the impact that we were seeking I think
 
03:06:11.349 --> 03:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
as it related to
 
03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
that yes um so uh I put this here
 
03:06:17.830 --> 03:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
visitor spending you'll see that we have
 
03:06:20.110 --> 03:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
obviously seen a very significant jump
 
03:06:22.309 --> 03:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years and it has
 
03:06:24.990 --> 03:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
been a trend that has maintained since
 
03:06:28.510 --> 03:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
2020 since covid um I would point out
 
03:06:30.830 --> 03:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
that this visitor spending level has
 
03:06:33.229 --> 03:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
resulted in revenues that have increased
 
03:06:35.670 --> 03:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
under the meals and rentals tax now
 
03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
significantly each year now we are over
 
03:06:41.590 --> 03:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
$300 million in Revenue uh since the
 
03:06:44.229 --> 03:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
covid pandemic and we've maintained that
 
03:06:47.309 --> 03:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
level uh consistently over the last four
 
03:06:47.319 --> 03:06:48.150 align:start position:0%
level uh consistently over the last four
years

03:06:48.150 --> 03:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:06:50.910 --> 03:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
years here's a slide that shows the
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
visitation numbers uh obviously a
 
03:06:53.680 --> 03:06:55.349 align:start position:0%
visitation numbers uh obviously a
similar

03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
similar
 
03:06:58.790 --> 03:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
Trend uh slide 16 I put this here to
 
03:07:00.830 --> 03:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
give you sort of an idea of the type of
 
03:07:03.950 --> 03:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
product that we do put out there um uh
 
03:07:05.550 --> 03:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
these are whether they're Billboards
 
03:07:08.070 --> 03:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
mostly digital ads the ones that I would
 
03:07:09.429 --> 03:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
point to you are the ones in the Middle
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
where it says enter your text here this
 
03:07:12.790 --> 03:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
is a new product that we've developed
 
03:07:14.349 --> 03:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
that we've made available to businesses
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
around the state to be able to take
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
templates like this use creative content
 
03:07:22.150 --> 03:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
photography video that we've generated
 
03:07:24.750 --> 03:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and and apply it as they see fit
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
whether if they're recruiting a new
 
03:07:27.910 --> 03:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce or whether they want to
 
03:07:29.309 --> 03:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
upgrade their website or whe they want
 
03:07:31.349 --> 03:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of small businesses have
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
taken us up on this and it's all free
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
and available on our website so
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
something again there where we're
 
03:07:39.429 --> 03:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
providing some value to our businesses
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
and making the marketing look very
 
03:07:44.990 --> 03:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
similar which is obviously of value to
 
03:07:45.790 --> 03:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
those of you who've been in the
 
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
marketing space so I think my last slide
 
03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
here is really reiterating some of the
 
03:07:53.790 --> 03:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
issues that I've talked about uh today
 
03:07:55.670 --> 03:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
the one that I have not touched on that
 
03:07:58.190 --> 03:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
I do think uh is something we need to be
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
looking at from an economic perspective
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
is the issue of child care um as we
 
03:08:05.870 --> 03:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
continue to see uh very positive Trends
 
03:08:08.590 --> 03:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh population growth and
 
03:08:11.309 --> 03:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
particularly in uh working age
 
03:08:14.510 --> 03:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
population growth uh in uh not just our
 
03:08:16.389 --> 03:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
urban areas but in rural areas around
 
03:08:18.750 --> 03:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
the state it is a trend that we are
 
03:08:21.630 --> 03:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
seeing uh those those are typically
 
03:08:24.150 --> 03:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
young families and those are young
 
03:08:27.309 --> 03:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
families that are in many cases in need
 
03:08:30.349 --> 03:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
of some type of child care to be able to
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh participate in our Workforce and to
 
03:08:36.269 --> 03:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
uh really experience the full uh uh the
 
03:08:38.670 --> 03:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
full capabilities of our economy so I
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
put that there uh because it is
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
something that we consider as important
 
03:08:45.550 --> 03:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
um almost as important as as the housing
 
03:08:48.030 --> 03:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
issue as we as we move forward so so
 
03:08:50.190 --> 03:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
that is my very brief and and quick
 
03:08:52.349 --> 03:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
overview of a lot of the economic issues
 
03:08:54.030 --> 03:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman and happy to take any
 
03:08:55.830 --> 03:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you that was very
 
03:08:58.309 --> 03:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
helpful um we have a lot of questions
 
03:08:59.830 --> 03:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
why don't we just start here and work
 
03:09:02.190 --> 03:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
this way representative ORS thank you Mr
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
03:09:06.269 --> 03:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
so approximately if you know off top of
 
03:09:09.070 --> 03:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
your what is your budget yearly budget
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
so uh we have a a General Revenue budget
 
03:09:13.870 --> 03:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
about $16 million we have Federal
 
03:09:15.389 --> 03:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
funding that is a little less than that
 
03:09:18.630 --> 03:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
about 15 million oh what
 
03:09:21.469 --> 03:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
and so uh how much do you attribute the
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
money you you take the money you're
 
03:09:25.950 --> 03:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
spending to run your department so on
 
03:09:28.269 --> 03:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
and so forth how much additional Revenue
 
03:09:30.309 --> 03:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
do you think you provide to the state
 
03:09:32.269 --> 03:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
can you quantify that I can tell you
 
03:09:34.269 --> 03:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
that uh we have done studies on that as
 
03:09:36.190 --> 03:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
it relates to the tourism component
 
03:09:39.070 --> 03:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
which of that roughly what did I say 15
 
03:09:42.750 --> 03:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
or 16 million in state cost uh roughly
 
03:09:45.429 --> 03:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh 10 to 11 million of that is
 
03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
specifically for our work in tourism
 
03:09:50.670 --> 03:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
marketing that our current return on
 
03:09:52.590 --> 03:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
investment statistic is
 
03:09:55.550 --> 03:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
$17 in return for every dollar that we
 
03:09:57.910 --> 03:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
invest in marketing okay excellent
 
03:09:59.750 --> 03:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty good return I remember I
 
03:10:01.469 --> 03:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
think was state in New York I love New
 
03:10:03.389 --> 03:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
York they canceled their program and
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
they lost Untold Millions by cancelling
 
03:10:09.590 --> 03:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
that program so good very good thank you
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes we were happy to receive them here
 
03:10:13.630 --> 03:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire coming around this way who uh
 
03:10:20.429 --> 03:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
yes represent berer thank you Mr chair
 
03:10:24.750 --> 03:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'm having a little yeah let me try
 
03:10:27.229 --> 03:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
to slide over here
 
03:10:31.309 --> 03:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire has the lowest State
 
03:10:32.910 --> 03:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
support for public education in the
 
03:10:35.110 --> 03:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
country and the second highest college
 
03:10:37.950 --> 03:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
instate tuition in the country we've had
 
03:10:41.070 --> 03:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
the highest increase in the number of
 
03:10:44.750 --> 03:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
unhoused people in the entire
 
03:10:47.309 --> 03:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
country my constituents are telling me
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
that they are quitting their jobs
 
03:10:51.309 --> 03:10:51.319 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford the cost of
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
child care and they can't get health
 
03:10:56.269 --> 03:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
care appointments because there aren't
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
sufficient providers so looking back on
 
03:11:02.309 --> 03:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
the statement about New Hampshire is
 
03:11:05.070 --> 03:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
ranked number one for economic freedom
 
03:11:07.710 --> 03:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out what that means
 
03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
can you please help me yes ma'am so I
 
03:11:13.309 --> 03:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
think obviously those issues that you
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
rais are really critical to our
 
03:11:17.349 --> 03:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
employers and obviously to our
 
03:11:19.309 --> 03:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
communities but I would say at the same
 
03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
time these are issues that are
 
03:11:23.550 --> 03:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
reflective of the growth of our economy
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
since Co we have seen some significant
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh growth and and and there has been
 
03:11:31.389 --> 03:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
some significant investment as I pointed
 
03:11:34.710 --> 03:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
out in expansion and in new Recruitment
 
03:11:38.670 --> 03:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
and that requires uh uh housing for for
 
03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
employees that requires uh new Access to
 
03:11:44.110 --> 03:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
Health Care Child Care all the things
 
03:11:45.870 --> 03:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
that you're mentioning and what that has
 
03:11:48.550 --> 03:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
done is put strain on existing systems
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
that are in place so I think as we
 
03:11:53.070 --> 03:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
continue to see growth in the economy
 
03:11:55.710 --> 03:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
that comes with other challenges uh
 
03:11:58.269 --> 03:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
along the way so there are many ways
 
03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that can be addressed and I think
 
03:12:01.030 --> 03:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
that those are the issues that are going
 
03:12:04.110 --> 03:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
to be Central to the discussions uh of
 
03:12:07.110 --> 03:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
the budget over the next couple of
 
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
months thank you yes representative
 
03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%

several years ago uh this committee was
 
03:12:24.510 --> 03:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh instrumental in helping Dean Cayman
 
03:12:29.830 --> 03:12:29.840 align:start position:0%

lot of emails from me so sounds good uh
 
03:13:43.190 --> 03:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
did you have a question represent Erie
 
03:13:45.469 --> 03:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
did you have a question okay moving this
 
03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald do you have ecomic freed
 
03:14:17.150 --> 03:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:19.950 --> 03:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
I would say I I I hadn't fully examined
 
03:14:22.910 --> 03:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
any partisan component to that to that
 
03:14:26.030 --> 03:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
ranking and uh I don't have like an
 
03:14:29.110 --> 03:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
alternative economic ranking to their to
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
theirs they they sort of own that space
 
03:14:33.269 --> 03:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
they have for some years and it it's an
 
03:14:36.229 --> 03:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
international organization I can't I I
 
03:14:38.349 --> 03:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the politics of a
 
03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
Canadian libertarian but those uh their
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
statistics I think are not necessarily
 
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:55.760 --> 03:14:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:14:57.590 --> 03:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:15:01.150 --> 03:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
invest and I know we made a change in
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.710 --> 03:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
yeah what percent of those UNS are
 
03:15:18.830 --> 03:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
five so I don't I don't it's it's a it's
 
03:15:25.990 --> 03:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
a high majority that are affordable of
 
03:15:28.269 --> 03:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
the 5,000 I don't have that number stuck
 
03:15:29.950 --> 03:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
in my head right now but let me get that
 
03:15:32.790 --> 03:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
for you Senator um but you are correct
 
03:15:35.910 --> 03:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the the the funds that were used
 
03:15:38.670 --> 03:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
under the $60 million component of
 
03:15:42.550 --> 03:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
invest NH were for five years right the
 
03:15:44.189 --> 03:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
anything that we're doing under housing
 
03:15:46.469 --> 03:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
Champions or subsequent invest inh
 
03:15:48.429 --> 03:15:48.439 align:start position:0%
programs that are funded by the state
 
03:15:51.429 --> 03:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
are required to be at 10 years so that
 
03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:57.750 --> 03:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
difference okay well I can take one more
 
03:15:59.950 --> 03:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
question yes represent
 
03:16:02.590 --> 03:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
Opel uh thank you Mr chairman and and
 
03:16:04.110 --> 03:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner for taking my
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
question I and I I realize this is
 
03:16:07.990 --> 03:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
difficult but but part of this
 
03:16:10.630 --> 03:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
committee's mission is to is to look
 
03:16:13.510 --> 03:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
into the future um and and provide
 
03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
Finance committees with with information
 
03:16:20.590 --> 03:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering at this point um in your
 
03:16:23.429 --> 03:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
agency um if you've had an opportunity
 
03:16:26.710 --> 03:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
to begin to assess the impact if the
 
03:16:28.510 --> 03:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
federal government does indeed go
 
03:16:31.469 --> 03:16:31.479 align:start position:0%
forward with pretty significant tariff
 
03:16:35.189 --> 03:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
program what impact that might have both
 
03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
on um the the economic impact in New
 
03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire both the businesses that are
 
03:16:43.349 --> 03:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
obviously exporting as you highlighted
 
03:16:45.950 --> 03:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and the possibility of retaliatory
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
tariffs uh from EU for example um and
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
just generally on the on the economic
 
03:16:54.150 --> 03:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
picture what whether you've had an
 
03:16:56.910 --> 03:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to assess it or if you
 
03:16:59.870 --> 03:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
haven't um what information you'll be
 
03:17:02.950 --> 03:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
providing to us later on we have done uh
 
03:17:04.630 --> 03:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
some early assessment on that and it's
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
based on historic uh activity in this
 
03:17:11.630 --> 03:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
area and and in the long term uh tariffs
 
03:17:14.309 --> 03:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
at that level are significantly
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
detrimental to our economy uh
 
03:17:20.110 --> 03:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
those are uh we depend very heavily on
 
03:17:22.189 --> 03:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
the crossborder traffic with Canada
 
03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
particularly they are by far our largest
 
03:17:27.630 --> 03:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
trading partner uh we obviously sit
 
03:17:29.950 --> 03:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
right on the border uh a lot of the
 
03:17:31.710 --> 03:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
Investments that I mentioned the billion
 
03:17:34.229 --> 03:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
dollars since 2020 uh I would say a good
 
03:17:36.349 --> 03:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
portion of that is Investments that have
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
been made by the Canadians in in New
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I I think one Dynamic that
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
we are seeing right now is a is a uptick
 
03:17:48.670 --> 03:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
in a lot of activity around those
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
products that um would be Pro
 
03:17:54.429 --> 03:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
potentially uh impacted by a tariff so
 
03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
there's a bump that we see right now in
 
03:17:57.910 --> 03:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
terms of that activity but if this goes
 
03:17:59.429 --> 03:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
on for a long period of time that could
 
03:18:02.910 --> 03:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
be a challenge um I would say uh the
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
experience we had under covid where we
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
closed the border is extremely
 
03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
instructive that that did not assist
 
03:18:11.110 --> 03:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
with the recovery and then once the
 
03:18:14.030 --> 03:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
Border reopened uh we saw significant
 
03:18:16.590 --> 03:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
benefit at that point at that time we
 
03:18:19.070 --> 03:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
were also dealing with a tourism benefit
 
03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
because people themselves couldn't get
 
03:18:24.229 --> 03:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
over the Border um but uh the movement
 
03:18:26.710 --> 03:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
of of goods and services uh between New
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and particularly Canada are
 
03:18:32.189 --> 03:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
significant thank you commissioner
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
Caswell that's has been very informative
 
03:18:35.870 --> 03:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:39.429 --> 03:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
everyone all right um as you can see
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
from the program the next speaker is at
 
03:18:45.150 --> 03:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
1: p.m. so that leaves us about uh 43
 
03:18:49.070 --> 03:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
minutes for lunch um um so we will
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%

04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
um we'll get on to our next uh speaker
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
which is Dr Kenneth
 
04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
and i' I've been told that um for people
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
watching online they're not able to hear
 
04:05:53.070 --> 04:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh senators
 
04:05:55.870 --> 04:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
or a representative or whoever who is
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
not at a microphone so what I would ask
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh you to do Dr Johnson is if someone
 
04:06:03.630 --> 04:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
from this inner table that doesn't have
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
a microphone asks you a question if you
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
could just restate the question so
 
04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
online people
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.070 --> 04:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
okay I guess everyone is mostly settled
 
04:06:41.070 --> 04:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
so we will start you can start by
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'm Ken Johnson I'm a demographer and
 
04:06:50.349 --> 04:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
professor of Sociology at the University
 
04:06:54.189 --> 04:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and uh I appreciate
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
being invited to talk to this
 
04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
group I think demographic Trends in the
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
state are important so I'm glad to have
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to summarize them for you
 
04:07:06.309 --> 04:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to acknowledge the people
 
04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
who have funded my
 
04:07:09.870 --> 04:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
research uh that you're hearing about
 
04:07:12.950 --> 04:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
today you can see it's a broad way of
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
array of places and if somebody's
 
04:07:17.469 --> 04:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
interested in that afterwards I can tell
 
04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
you how NASA ended up funding a
 
04:07:24.269 --> 04:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
demographer but anyway so New
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's popultion growth Trends have
 
04:07:30.630 --> 04:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
slowed in recent decades but in the
 
04:07:34.269 --> 04:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
short term that is in the last few years
 
04:07:36.269 --> 04:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
migration and population growth in the
 
04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
state have
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
increased so when I talk about
 
04:07:41.309 --> 04:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
demographic change and I'm not I'm not
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
trying to make this demography 101 but
 
04:07:46.630 --> 04:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
it is important to recognize populations
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
change in a variety of different ways
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
they can change by natural change which
 
04:07:51.990 --> 04:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
is the difference between births and
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
deaths and then Mig my migration is the
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
other driving force of population change
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
and it's always a combination of in
 
04:08:01.630 --> 04:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
migrants and out migrants and that's a
 
04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
point I want to make to you later on in
 
04:08:06.030 --> 04:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
some of my talk I'll talk about two
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
different kinds of migration domestic
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
migration which is people moving to New
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from other us destinations and
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
then immigration which is people moving
 
04:08:18.429 --> 04:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire from another country
 
04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
directly from another
 
04:08:23.149 --> 04:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
country so this is just a
 
04:08:27.790 --> 04:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
long-term or at least decadal trend for
 
04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh New England and you can see that New
 
04:08:31.790 --> 04:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is among the fastest growing
 
04:08:34.750 --> 04:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
States in New Hampshire or in New
 
04:08:37.710 --> 04:08:37.720 align:start position:0%
England uh and most of its growth comes
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
as you'll note here from the
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
migration natural change that is the
 
04:08:44.189 --> 04:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
difference between ver and deaths which
 
04:08:45.750 --> 04:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
used to fuel a lot of growth in New
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fuels much less of it
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
now these are the most recent data
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
available released by the Census Bureau
 
04:08:55.630 --> 04:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
less than a month ago and they show the
 
04:08:58.109 --> 04:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
M patterns of population change between
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
2020 and
 
04:09:03.109 --> 04:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
2024 and here you can see a more
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
detailed reflection of recent
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
demographic Trends so New Hampshire's
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
population grew between 20 and
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
2024 all of the growth all of the growth
 
04:09:16.590 --> 04:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
came from migration there were more
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
deaths than births in New Hampshire
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
between 2020 and 2024 now part of that's
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic but New
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already had more deaths than
 
04:09:27.950 --> 04:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
births what demographers call Natural
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
decrease before the pandemic began
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
so again if New Hampshire's population's
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to grow the growth is going to
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
come from migration and you can see in
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
these data that between 2020 and 2024
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
most of the growth in New Hampshire came
 
04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
from domestic migration from people
 
04:09:50.510 --> 04:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
moving to New Hampshire from other us
 
04:09:52.510 --> 04:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
destinations there's also a modest
 
04:09:54.750 --> 04:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
amount of immigration but if you look at
 
04:09:56.670 --> 04:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for example in comparison
 
04:09:58.630 --> 04:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts which is right next to
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
it on this graphic you can see that
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts had domestic migration
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
loss more people left Massachusetts than
 
04:10:08.590 --> 04:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
came to it and its population grew
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
primarily because of immigration and so
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
you can see the contrast in the
 
04:10:14.910 --> 04:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
different states about how population
 
04:10:17.269 --> 04:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
change came to
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
be this is just po just so you can see a
 
04:10:23.070 --> 04:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
map this is population change by county
 
04:10:25.950 --> 04:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
for New England and New York uh between
 
04:10:27.389 --> 04:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
2020 and
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
2023 and you can see that all of New
 
04:10:33.870 --> 04:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's counties grew during that
 
04:10:36.269 --> 04:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
period these are the very long-term
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
population change trends for New
 
04:10:41.550 --> 04:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from the 1970s forward and you
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
can see the balance between net
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
migration and natural increase changes
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
net migration fueled most of the growth
 
04:10:50.590 --> 04:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire through most of this
 
04:10:53.790 --> 04:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
period but natural increase was also an
 
04:10:55.990 --> 04:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
important driving force but as you get
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
to 2010 to 2020 you can see that natural
 
04:11:02.910 --> 04:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
increase diminishes to almost nothing
 
04:11:04.870 --> 04:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
and all of almost all the growth is
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
fueled by
 
04:11:10.349 --> 04:11:10.359 align:start position:0%
migration these then are more detailed
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
data showing you the early part of the
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
201 to 2020 decade and the later part
 
04:11:18.030 --> 04:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
this is when the between 2010 and 2015
 
04:11:20.510 --> 04:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
the recession was still affecting New
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it slowed domestic
 
04:11:25.790 --> 04:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
migration to the to the state as we get
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
into the later part of the decade this
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
is when burth began to not be as
 
04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
numerous as deaths and the population
 
04:11:36.429 --> 04:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
began to decline through natural decline
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
that was offset by a combination of
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
domestic and immigration and then
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 2024
 
04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
the natural decrease increased again
 
04:11:49.149 --> 04:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
partially because of covid and the
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
domestic migration into New Hampshire
 
04:11:55.229 --> 04:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
accelerated immigration also continued
 
04:11:57.389 --> 04:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
now part of this we think is because of
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
Co itself that is States like New
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tended to receive an influx of
 
04:12:06.670 --> 04:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
of domestic migrants During the period
 
04:12:09.030 --> 04:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
of covid whereas States like
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts particularly the urban
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
core of Massachusetts experienc
 
04:12:15.109 --> 04:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
population out
 
04:12:17.710 --> 04:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
migration uh similar Trends exist in
 
04:12:20.830 --> 04:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
other parts of uh New England especially
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
Northern New England and also in other
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
parts of the country
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
where places with big Urban cores had
 
04:12:28.479 --> 04:12:29.469 align:start position:0%
where places with big Urban cores had
domestic

04:12:29.469 --> 04:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
04:12:31.469 --> 04:12:31.479 align:start position:0%
outmigration at the same time that
 
04:12:33.389 --> 04:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
immigration was diminishing because of
 
04:12:33.399 --> 04:12:34.269 align:start position:0%
immigration was diminishing because of
the

04:12:34.269 --> 04:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:37.389 --> 04:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
pandemic and then States like New
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gained migrants during this
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
period now a big question as we go into
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
the future is whether that domestic
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
migration will be sustained or whether
 
04:12:49.109 --> 04:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
it will slow down the most recent data
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
I've seen that it isn't on these slides
 
04:12:54.510 --> 04:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
suggests that migration to New Hampshire
 
04:12:57.630 --> 04:12:57.640 align:start position:0%
may be slowing in the last year or
 
04:13:00.429 --> 04:13:00.439 align:start position:0%
so this is the this is burs and deaths
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
just so you can see the
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
natural part of the change in New
 
04:13:06.910 --> 04:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population reaching all the
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
way back to 1970 and you can see the
 
04:13:11.950 --> 04:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
birds traditionally had exceeded deaths
 
04:13:15.030 --> 04:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
by a substantial number number but
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
starting in about
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
2018 deaths began to in to be more
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
frequent than burst in the state so this
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
is before the pandemic hit and then the
 
04:13:28.510 --> 04:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit and the gap between burst
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
and Des increased you can see that it's
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
fallen off slightly in the last year the
 
04:13:36.109 --> 04:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
newest CDC data which isn't complete yet
 
04:13:38.590 --> 04:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
suggests that it's slowed that the gap
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
between birs and deaths probably
 
04:13:42.670 --> 04:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
narrowed a little bit more in the last
 
04:13:45.109 --> 04:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
few months ons now New Hampshire has
 
04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
natural decrease more deaths and births
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
because it has an older
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
population because it has fewer women of
 
04:13:55.229 --> 04:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
childbearing age and because the
 
04:13:57.189 --> 04:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
fertility rates among women in New
 
04:13:59.070 --> 04:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are lower than they are
 
04:14:01.710 --> 04:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so the combination of those
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
things an older population fewer women
 
04:14:07.389 --> 04:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
of childbearing age lower birth rates
 
04:14:10.349 --> 04:14:10.359 align:start position:0%
among women of childbearing age produces
 
04:14:14.790 --> 04:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
this combination of more deaths and
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
Bros now this is an important slide and
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
and if you take one thing away from my
 
04:14:23.950 --> 04:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
talk this would be one of the things I'd
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
want you to take away a lot of what I've
 
04:14:28.830 --> 04:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
been talking about is net migration
 
04:14:30.990 --> 04:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between the inflow
 
04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
and the outflow of people into the state
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
so what this graphic does is to break
 
04:14:39.149 --> 04:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
down those patterns so that you can see
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
each part of them so on the left we have
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
natural change the difference between
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
births and deaths and you can see that
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
between 2018 and 2022 there were about
 
04:14:50.830 --> 04:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
60,000 births in New Hampshire but
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
68,000 deaths so there's that natural
 
04:14:56.269 --> 04:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
loss of
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
7,000 but the numbers I really want you
 
04:15:00.670 --> 04:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
to look at are the next set that is for
 
04:15:00.680 --> 04:15:02.109 align:start position:0%
to look at are the next set that is for
domestic

04:15:02.109 --> 04:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
04:15:05.309 --> 04:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
migration so New Hampshire had a net
 
04:15:07.469 --> 04:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
change through domestic migration of
 
04:15:11.630 --> 04:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
about 36,000 people between 2018 and
 
04:15:14.830 --> 04:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
2022 and you might say well gee out of a
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
population of 1.4 million 36,000 isn't
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
very many but the thing I want you to
 
04:15:25.109 --> 04:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
see here is that that change of 36,000
 
04:15:29.109 --> 04:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
came because 260,000 people moved into
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from other us destinations
 
04:15:33.990 --> 04:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
and 224,000
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
left it's now in a state of 1.4 million
 
04:15:40.389 --> 04:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a turnover of the
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
population of almost 500,000
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
so in a sense the people are in New many
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the people who are in New Hampshire
 
04:15:52.990 --> 04:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
now weren't here five or 10 years ago
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
and many people who were here aren't
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
here anymore so when you think about New
 
04:16:00.149 --> 04:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population it has one of the
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
highest turnover rates in the United
 
04:16:03.870 --> 04:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
States there's
 
04:16:06.870 --> 04:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
more in andout flows from New Hampshire
 
04:16:09.389 --> 04:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
than from many other
 
04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
states and then you can see immigration
 
04:16:13.990 --> 04:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
as well which is New Hampshire has a
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
very modest immigration
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
generally uh 13 about 14,000 moved in
 
04:16:22.590 --> 04:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants came directly to New
 
04:16:25.870 --> 04:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now somebody if a person came
 
04:16:29.389 --> 04:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts from Mexico and then
 
04:16:31.630 --> 04:16:31.640 align:start position:0%
later move from Mex from new Hamp from
 
04:16:33.469 --> 04:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to New Hampshire that's
 
04:16:36.109 --> 04:16:36.119 align:start position:0%
considered a domestic migrant so just to
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
keep that distinction clear these are
 
04:16:40.349 --> 04:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
people moving directly to New Hampshire
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
part of
 
04:16:49.630 --> 04:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
that Trend that we were talking about is
 
04:16:52.269 --> 04:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
reflected in this graphic this graphic
 
04:16:55.030 --> 04:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
shows that the majority of the people
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire were born
 
04:16:59.070 --> 04:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere else how many of you were born
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.469 --> 04:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not very many right only about
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
40% of the people in New Hampshire were
 
04:17:08.950 --> 04:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
born in the
 
04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
state only four states have a smaller
 
04:17:14.189 --> 04:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
proportion of their population born in
 
04:17:17.910 --> 04:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
the state so New Hampshire much more
 
04:17:20.349 --> 04:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
than many other states is a state where
 
04:17:22.109 --> 04:17:22.119 align:start position:0%
people have come from somewhere else
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
some came a long time ago someone CA
 
04:17:26.590 --> 04:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
some came fairly
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
recently but it's not a state that has
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
most of the people living in it having
 
04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
been born
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
here and you can see in that sense that
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's different than New England and
 
04:17:39.790 --> 04:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
different than the United States both of
 
04:17:42.670 --> 04:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
which tend to have roughly 60% of the
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
people people living in the state having
 
04:17:46.149 --> 04:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
been born
 
04:17:48.670 --> 04:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
there so when you think about New
 
04:17:50.670 --> 04:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recognize it as a state where
 
04:17:55.389 --> 04:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:57.550 --> 04:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
population this is where domestic
 
04:17:59.469 --> 04:17:59.479 align:start position:0%
migrants people moving in the United
 
04:18:01.870 --> 04:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
States come from and go to now it's
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
probably no surprise to you that the
 
04:18:05.429 --> 04:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
biggest source of migrants to New
 
04:18:07.990 --> 04:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is Massachusetts in fact about
 
04:18:11.149 --> 04:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
25% of the population of New Hampshire
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
was born in Massachusetts
 
04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
so you can see the inflow of people to
 
04:18:20.109 --> 04:18:20.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on the left and then where
 
04:18:23.309 --> 04:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
people leave New Hampshire to go to on
 
04:18:26.030 --> 04:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
the right and there you can see that
 
04:18:28.389 --> 04:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
places like the South are better are
 
04:18:31.309 --> 04:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
much more likely to receive out migrants
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire than inmigrants
 
04:18:36.109 --> 04:18:36.119 align:start position:0%
coming from them to New
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and again this emphasizes the
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
point this is in one year 50,000 in
 
04:18:45.149 --> 04:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
migrants and 44,000 out migrants that
 
04:18:47.950 --> 04:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
again is that that big turnover that
 
04:18:50.830 --> 04:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
produces a change of 6,000 and also
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
there was probably about 5,000
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
immigrants coming to New Hampshire
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
during that period as
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
well now this is some really new data
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're actually going to release this
 
04:19:03.510 --> 04:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
research later this week but it was so
 
04:19:06.910 --> 04:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
striking that I wanted you to see it not
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
just people flow between places but
 
04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
money flows between places as well well
 
04:19:16.030 --> 04:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
and so this is Internal Revenue Service
 
04:19:19.710 --> 04:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
data and it shows between 2020 and 2022
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
so the three years of the
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic this is the annual flow of
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
income to and from New Hampshire because
 
04:19:27.720 --> 04:19:28.590 align:start position:0%
income to and from New Hampshire because
of

04:19:28.590 --> 04:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:19:31.710 --> 04:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
migration so the orange bar shows look
 
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
at Massachusetts for example the orange
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
bar shows
 
04:19:39.630 --> 04:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
that immigrants from New Hampshire
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
people who move here in an annual on an
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
in a per in the in one year so these are
 
04:19:46.710 --> 04:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
annual numbers even though they're for
 
04:19:46.720 --> 04:19:47.870 align:start position:0%
annual numbers even though they're for
three

04:19:47.870 --> 04:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:19:52.109 --> 04:19:52.119 align:start position:0%
years they had income of about 1.4
 
04:19:54.910 --> 04:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
billion the people who left New
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for Massachusetts had an a net
 
04:20:00.389 --> 04:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
income or gross income of about
 
04:20:00.399 --> 04:20:01.950 align:start position:0%
income or gross income of about
$487

04:20:01.950 --> 04:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
$487
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
million so in that migration Exchange in
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
in a in a year New Hampshire gained
 
04:20:12.790 --> 04:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
about $952 million of income from that m
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
ation exchange with New Hampshire or
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
with Massachusetts now you can see the
 
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
trends with other places as well clearly
 
04:20:22.510 --> 04:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
when you look at the South for example
 
04:20:25.070 --> 04:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
more money flows out of New Hampshire to
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
the South than comes into New Hampshire
 
04:20:30.910 --> 04:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
from the South but again appreciate it
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's not just people that are moving
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
it's income as well this is uh this
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
summarizes the whole period one key
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
point is that the income flow into New
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from Massachusetts increased
 
04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
dramatically during the recession or
 
04:20:49.750 --> 04:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
during the
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic so before the pandemic the net
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
gain over three years was 1.3 mil3
 
04:20:59.469 --> 04:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
billion during the pandemic it went up
 
04:21:03.750 --> 04:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
to $2.8 billion do in three years so
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
quite a contrast now a big question is
 
04:21:08.109 --> 04:21:08.119 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the future if
 
04:21:10.109 --> 04:21:10.119 align:start position:0%
the migration from New Hampshire from
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to New Hampshire slows
 
04:21:14.349 --> 04:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
down it's likely that the income stream
 
04:21:16.389 --> 04:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
will as well
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
but again it's not just people who are
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
moving this is actual people moving and
 
04:21:25.550 --> 04:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
so you can see that the the number of
 
04:21:27.309 --> 04:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
migrants to New Hampshire from
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts increased as well but
 
04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
incomes increased a lot more which would
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
suggest that relatively High income
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
households tended to move from
 
04:21:40.950 --> 04:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to New Hampshire now
 
04:21:43.149 --> 04:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
there's anecdotal evidence that this has
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
gone on not just in New Hampshire but in
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country as well where
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
there are large recreational areas that
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
people who had more flexibility in their
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
jobs May well have moved from one place
 
04:22:02.910 --> 04:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
to another uh to more pleasant or more
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
recreationally oriented areas during the
 
04:22:09.630 --> 04:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic um you've all heard this I I
 
04:22:11.149 --> 04:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
assume you've heard the stories if you
 
04:22:13.229 --> 04:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
haven't that it was almost impossible to
 
04:22:16.469 --> 04:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
buy housing in places like Lake wiip in
 
04:22:42.510 --> 04:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.710 --> 04:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
is that going to slow down and we
 
04:22:47.149 --> 04:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
honestly just don't know
 
04:22:51.389 --> 04:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
yet so education is another resource
 
04:22:53.389 --> 04:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
that comes to New Hampshire from
 
04:22:57.109 --> 04:22:57.119 align:start position:0%
migration these data show the uh
 
04:22:59.189 --> 04:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
educational attainment levels of
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
different groups within New Hampshire so
 
04:23:04.510 --> 04:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
for example if you look at college
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
graduates a little bit over or a little
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
bit under 20% of New
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire born residents over the age of
 
04:23:17.790 --> 04:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
25 have a college a bachelor's degree
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
and contrast the migrants into the state
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the immigrants tend to have higher
 
04:23:25.070 --> 04:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
education levels both at the you can see
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
it at the college degree level and also
 
04:23:29.710 --> 04:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
at the graduate degree level so New
 
04:23:32.910 --> 04:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire receives people it receives
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
income and it re it receives skilled and
 
04:23:39.269 --> 04:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
educated people in the migration
 
04:23:41.830 --> 04:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
patterns that are going on that's one of
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
the reasons why I think migration is
 
04:23:45.670 --> 04:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
very important to the state these are
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
age specific migration patterns over the
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
last three decades they show us what the
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
age structure of the people coming to
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
and leaving the state are and you can
 
04:23:58.590 --> 04:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
see that New Hampshire tends to gain
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
people in their 30s and 40s that's the
 
04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the graph and each of
 
04:24:06.109 --> 04:24:06.119 align:start position:0%
those bars the blue gray and and red are
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
showing you the last three decades so
 
04:24:10.990 --> 04:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tends to gain people in
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
their working ages from 30 to 50 and it
 
04:24:16.510 --> 04:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
you can see the influx of children too
 
04:24:19.469 --> 04:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
many of those children are coming with
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
them in contrast New Hampshire in some
 
04:24:25.109 --> 04:24:25.119 align:start position:0%
decades has experienced a loss of people
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
in their 20s uh between 20 and 10 and
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
20120 the loss was
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
minimal uh but in the 20 2000 to20
 
04:24:37.670 --> 04:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
period the loss was somewhat larger so
 
04:24:39.309 --> 04:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire's going to lose people
 
04:24:41.830 --> 04:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
it loses people in their 20s but
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
relative modest shares of that
 
04:24:46.510 --> 04:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
population it gains people in their
 
04:24:49.109 --> 04:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
working ages and it gains children it
 
04:24:51.790 --> 04:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
has a modest inflow of older adults as
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
well so many states would give anything
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
to have the migration profile that New
 
04:24:59.870 --> 04:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does that that it re they
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
receive working age population
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
especially as we've seen from the
 
04:25:06.309 --> 04:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
earlier slides well-educated
 
04:25:09.109 --> 04:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh people with significant incomes
 
04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
migrating into the
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
state these are the most recent
 
04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
migration data they're not quite as good
 
04:25:18.429 --> 04:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
as the data I just showed you but you
 
04:25:20.830 --> 04:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
can see that the trends are similar that
 
04:25:22.990 --> 04:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
there's an influx of people in their 30s
 
04:25:23.000 --> 04:25:23.790 align:start position:0%
there's an influx of people in their 30s
and

04:25:23.790 --> 04:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:27.030 --> 04:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
40s uh and an influx of children with
 
04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
them and and then modest Flows at other
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
ages into or out of the state but almost
 
04:25:38.469 --> 04:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.109 --> 04:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
oldest this just to give you some idea
 
04:25:41.119 --> 04:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
oldest this just to give you some idea
yeah

04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I'm sorry you that's I put that
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
in at the last minute so mostly to
 
04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
confuse you but it's not right sorry I
 
04:25:54.790 --> 04:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
just couldn't bear not to
 
04:25:56.950 --> 04:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
have I couldn't bear not to have the
 
04:26:01.070 --> 04:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
latest data in there yeah see I'm glad
 
04:26:02.670 --> 04:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
you were paying
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
attention Okay this graphic just shows
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
you how many babies were born in New
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's the blue bar and then
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
how many children began the first first
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
grade six years later and you can see I
 
04:26:18.469 --> 04:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
mean this data these data go back quite
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
a ways but notice that in every year
 
04:26:25.149 --> 04:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
more kids begin the first grade than
 
04:26:27.550 --> 04:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
were born in New Hampshire six years
 
04:26:30.109 --> 04:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
earlier this is more evidence of that
 
04:26:32.910 --> 04:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
influx of working age people with
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
children right because they don't just
 
04:26:37.870 --> 04:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
bring the children with them they bring
 
04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
now as you all know demographic change
 
04:26:48.670 --> 04:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
varies across New
 
04:26:51.750 --> 04:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is population change from
 
04:26:53.109 --> 04:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
2010 to
 
04:26:56.750 --> 04:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
2020 and then from 2020 to 2023 which is
 
04:26:58.790 --> 04:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
the newest data we have at the at this
 
04:27:01.790 --> 04:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
level of geography and you can see that
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
the grow more of the growth occurs in
 
04:27:05.790 --> 04:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
the South particularly in the southeast
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
part of the state than
 
04:27:10.189 --> 04:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and you can see that the
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
growth was more widespread between 2020
 
04:27:16.109 --> 04:27:16.119 align:start position:0%
and 2023 than it had been in the 2010s
 
04:27:18.790 --> 04:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
so so far in this decade the un uh New
 
04:27:21.790 --> 04:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has received more population
 
04:27:26.070 --> 04:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
growth than it did later and you can see
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
that the highest growth rates continue
 
04:27:31.309 --> 04:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
to be mostly in the southern part of the
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
state or in the recreational areas in
 
04:27:35.870 --> 04:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
the middle part of the state but even in
 
04:27:37.630 --> 04:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
the northern part of the state which had
 
04:27:40.389 --> 04:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
widespread population loss in the last
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
decade there have been population gains
 
04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
so uh this is just to underscore the
 
04:27:49.229 --> 04:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
fact that population is is changing in
 
04:27:51.389 --> 04:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that it's uneven some
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
places are gaining population some
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
places are losing population but in
 
04:27:57.870 --> 04:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
general the state has done better in the
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
first three years of this decade than it
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
did in the 2010 to 2020
 
04:28:07.109 --> 04:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
period this is just uh the growth rate
 
04:28:09.990 --> 04:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
or the population gains in each of New
 
04:28:12.870 --> 04:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
England New Hampshire's 10 counties
 
04:28:15.950 --> 04:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
be for the 2010 to 2020 period in blue
 
04:28:19.590 --> 04:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
and in the 2020 to 2023 period in red
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
and you can see that for most of the
 
04:28:23.429 --> 04:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
counties they gained more population
 
04:28:26.910 --> 04:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
recently than they did earlier so again
 
04:28:29.070 --> 04:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
The Point again is that the the
 
04:28:31.349 --> 04:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
population growth rates vary across the
 
04:28:34.670 --> 04:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:36.950 --> 04:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere this is just for the most
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
recent data and it shows population
 
04:28:39.960 --> 04:28:42.429 align:start position:0%
recent data and it shows population
change

04:28:42.429 --> 04:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
for each of the counties broken down by
 
04:28:48.429 --> 04:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
how the population grew or declined
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
you'll notice first that only Hillsboro
 
04:28:52.870 --> 04:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
County had more births than deaths all
 
04:28:55.070 --> 04:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
the other nine counties of the state had
 
04:28:56.950 --> 04:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
more people dying than be born during
 
04:29:00.189 --> 04:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
the period so but it all the all the
 
04:29:03.070 --> 04:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
counties in the state gained population
 
04:29:04.870 --> 04:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
and that population gain was almost
 
04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
entirely due to migration so again this
 
04:29:10.349 --> 04:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
just underscores how important migration
 
04:29:15.469 --> 04:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:17.630 --> 04:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
I I picked out four different kinds of
 
04:29:20.469 --> 04:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire so you could
 
04:29:22.870 --> 04:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
see the patterns compared to one another
 
04:29:25.030 --> 04:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
on the left is Carol County which of
 
04:29:28.109 --> 04:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
course is a recreational County in the
 
04:29:30.630 --> 04:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
middle of the state its growth is
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
entirely fueled by migration it has the
 
04:29:34.870 --> 04:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
highest growth in the in the
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
state um it's very common for
 
04:29:41.070 --> 04:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
recreational counties like Carol to gain
 
04:29:43.149 --> 04:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
migrants from other places there are
 
04:29:45.469 --> 04:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
about 300 counties like Caroll County in
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
the United States and they have all
 
04:29:51.070 --> 04:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
almost all their growth is fueled by
 
04:29:53.790 --> 04:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
migration from people moving to them
 
04:29:56.469 --> 04:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
partially it's PE older people moving to
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
them to Second homes or to enjoy the
 
04:30:03.030 --> 04:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
recreational amenities of the area but
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
other people are coming to staff the
 
04:30:07.710 --> 04:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals build the
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
Cottages fix the roads all the other
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
things that have to be done in a in a
 
04:30:16.349 --> 04:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
county like that Rockingham County is a
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
is a considered part of the Boston
 
04:30:21.910 --> 04:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area so it's in many ways
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
the outermost edge of the Boston suburbs
 
04:30:28.429 --> 04:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
or exurban I'm not sure that they would
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
be happy to be referred to as suburbs of
 
04:30:33.630 --> 04:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
Boston but you can see that the pattern
 
04:30:37.389 --> 04:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
of change there is the growth is slower
 
04:30:40.309 --> 04:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
but migration is fueling much of it
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
there was a little bit of natural
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
increase 2010 to 2020 but not during the
 
04:30:50.030 --> 04:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
2020 to 2023 period Hillsboro County you
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
can see also is the only County that had
 
04:30:54.229 --> 04:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
population increase from natural
 
04:30:56.870 --> 04:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
increase in both periods its growth rate
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
actually slowed between 2020 and 2023
 
04:31:02.389 --> 04:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
compared to earlier because migration to
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
the area diminished and then Kos
 
04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
County um experienced a lot of natural
 
04:31:13.750 --> 04:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
decrease in each of the two de
 
04:31:16.830 --> 04:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
periods in 2010 to 2020 there was very
 
04:31:19.630 --> 04:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
modest immigra uh domestic migration but
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't enough to offset that natural
 
04:31:25.990 --> 04:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
decline between 2020 and 2023 migration
 
04:31:28.309 --> 04:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
increased to the county and it was
 
04:31:30.429 --> 04:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
enough to offset the very substantial
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
increase in uh deaths over
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
births so four different counties within
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
the same state each with a quite a
 
04:31:41.550 --> 04:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
different kind of demographic change
 
04:31:41.560 --> 04:31:45.109 align:start position:0%
different kind of demographic change
path

04:31:45.109 --> 04:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
you all have heard that New Hampshire is
 
04:31:46.920 --> 04:31:49.030 align:start position:0%
you all have heard that New Hampshire is
aging

04:31:49.030 --> 04:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
aging
 
04:31:52.070 --> 04:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
rapidly this is population excuse me are
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
you willing to take questions during the
 
04:31:57.070 --> 04:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
rosenal about birth are you talking
 
04:32:05.109 --> 04:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
about where the baby is born or where
 
04:32:08.750 --> 04:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
the baby was right place of birth is
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
measured in these data by the residents
 
04:32:13.790 --> 04:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:32:16.030 --> 04:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
mother I mean we have problems with that
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
because when you get down to close to
 
04:32:19.950 --> 04:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts border many children
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
are born in Mass uh New Hampshire
 
04:32:24.349 --> 04:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
children are born in Massachusetts but
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're counted in the place where they
 
04:32:29.710 --> 04:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
live okay good question uh we go one
 
04:32:32.710 --> 04:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
more representative elme yes is there
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
any way we could see these slides online
 
04:32:36.319 --> 04:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
any way we could see these slides online
in

04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
color yes I mean if we can arrange for
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
we can arrange for it
 
04:32:49.309 --> 04:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
than okay I know I'm throwing a lot of
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
data at you your eyes don't look quite
 
04:32:53.469 --> 04:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
as glazed over as my undergraduates
 
04:32:57.710 --> 04:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
would but I apologize for but I mean
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
there this is a complicated story and I
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
want you to see as much of the Nuance of
 
04:33:04.510 --> 04:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
it as you can this is just population
 
04:33:07.709 --> 04:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
change in New Hampshire and I marked two
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
cohorts uh what birth cohorts these are
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
for example the one that's in blue at
 
04:33:14.990 --> 04:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
the top that's the cohort that was born
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
between 1950 and 59 so that's the heart
 
04:33:21.310 --> 04:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
of the baby boom a few of us are in that
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
cohort and I'm just tracing it through
 
04:33:26.830 --> 04:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
the three decades so you can see that
 
04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
cohort the big blue bar in their 40s
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
that was the baby boom cohort in the
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
1990s by the 2000 to 2010 period they're
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
the Red Bar they've shifted over 10
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
years in age and now
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh through in 2020 they're that light
 
04:33:48.269 --> 04:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
green bar that you can see in their 60s
 
04:33:50.910 --> 04:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
so that's the progression of the cohort
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
through the 30 years the smaller cohort
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
born in 70 to 79 you can see it moving
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
through uh on the bottom as well so it
 
04:34:05.470 --> 04:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
starts in its 20s and then shifts upward
 
04:34:08.189 --> 04:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
so bottom line is that the cohorts that
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
have children in them are getting
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
smaller while the cohort hearts that
 
04:34:14.109 --> 04:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
have older adults in them are getting
 
04:34:15.869 --> 04:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
bigger through this progression through
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
the age
 
04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
structure this is a population pyramid
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
this shows the population of New
 
04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
1990 the blue is the is men the red is
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
women and each of those bars represents
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
a 5-year period so right at the very
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
bottom are the babies that were just
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
born between 1986 and
 
04:34:41.070 --> 04:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
1990 and the baby boom generation the
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
one born
 
04:34:44.230 --> 04:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
you can see them in their 30s were born
 
04:34:47.390 --> 04:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
between 56 and 60 so you can see that
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
the at that time New Hampshire had a
 
04:34:51.070 --> 04:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
very large working age
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.789 --> 04:34:59.799 align:start position:0%
adults that bar is that pyramid is on
 
04:35:02.670 --> 04:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
the left on the right is the population
 
04:35:04.269 --> 04:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in
 
04:35:07.470 --> 04:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
2020 so you can see the upward shift of
 
04:35:10.029 --> 04:35:10.039 align:start position:0%
the population so that there are fewer
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
children at the bottom and that big
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
bulge of the baby boom is now in their
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
60s and 70s this is a close this is just
 
04:35:19.760 --> 04:35:21.269 align:start position:0%
60s and 70s this is a close this is just
2020

04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
2020
 
04:35:24.349 --> 04:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
so the population aging that's occurring
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is what what
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
demographers would call Aging in place
 
04:35:32.070 --> 04:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's not that a huge number of older
 
04:35:33.789 --> 04:35:33.799 align:start position:0%
adults are moving to New Hampshire
 
04:35:36.070 --> 04:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the older population the way
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
they would for example in
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
Florida this population is Aging in
 
04:35:43.109 --> 04:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
place and you can see that the cohorts
 
04:35:45.869 --> 04:35:45.879 align:start position:0%
who are moving into the older age groups
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
are much larger than the cohorts that
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
were older than them so for example
 
04:35:54.510 --> 04:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
people who were 60 to 69 in two 2020
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
there were 218,000 of them the cohort
 
04:35:59.709 --> 04:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
ahead of them has only
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
159,000 now partially that's because
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
mortality has diminished the size of
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
that cohort but that baby boom cohort is
 
04:36:09.670 --> 04:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
just bigger and so as though and the
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
cohort right behind it who were 50 59
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
and 2020 are also quite substantial so
 
04:36:18.189 --> 04:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
it's those big cohorts moving into older
 
04:36:22.470 --> 04:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
ages that's producing the silver tsunami
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
as it's called in contrast you can see
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
that the younger
 
04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
population uh are smaller and they're
 
04:36:32.230 --> 04:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
growing only
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
slowly the distribution of age and of
 
04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
age in New Hampshire is also an
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
important point that is just like
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
there's diversity and population change
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
in New hampsh
 
04:36:44.189 --> 04:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
there's also diversity and age
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
distributions so the graph on the left
 
04:36:49.150 --> 04:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
is showing you what percentage of the
 
04:36:51.910 --> 04:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
population in each of these areas is
 
04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
under the age of
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
18 and the dot map on the right is
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
showing you actually how many people
 
04:37:02.429 --> 04:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
that is and so you can see that in the
 
04:37:04.990 --> 04:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state not only is a
 
04:37:06.910 --> 04:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
larger proportion of the population
 
04:37:13.949 --> 04:37:13.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
in contrast in the north the population
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
has fewer young people and also there
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
are just fewer people there as well so I
 
04:37:25.390 --> 04:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
mean imagine the implications this has
 
04:37:28.590 --> 04:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
for school systems and
 
04:37:32.590 --> 04:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh operations or institutions that are
 
04:37:36.629 --> 04:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
CH that are child-based like maternity
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
WS this is the working age population 18
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:47.470 --> 04:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
again you can see that the distrib What
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
proportion of the populations in those
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
age groups varies quite a bit with a
 
04:37:53.709 --> 04:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
larger proportion of the population in
 
04:37:55.709 --> 04:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state
 
04:37:57.910 --> 04:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
especially in the Southeast being of
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
working age and also in the right hand
 
04:38:03.150 --> 04:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
map you can see that just in terms of
 
04:38:05.470 --> 04:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
the number of people who are in those
 
04:38:07.869 --> 04:38:07.879 align:start position:0%
groups it's much more concentrated in
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state of course
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's where most of the people are this
 
04:38:13.869 --> 04:38:13.879 align:start position:0%
is the older part of the population you
 
04:38:17.189 --> 04:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
may see the biggest contrasts here large
 
04:38:18.949 --> 04:38:18.959 align:start position:0%
proportions of the population in the
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
north are
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
older compared to in the
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
South they
 
04:38:27.949 --> 04:38:27.959 align:start position:0%
represent a modest share of the
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
population most of the older people are
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
still concentrated in the southern part
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the state just because that's where
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
most of the population is so again the
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
point I'm trying to make to you is that
 
04:38:40.510 --> 04:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
there's dramatic diversity even within
 
04:38:43.470 --> 04:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
this small state that there are places
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
that are growing rapidly that have to
 
04:38:47.830 --> 04:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
cope with growth and new schools and
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
things like that and then there are
 
04:38:51.390 --> 04:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
other parts of the state which have
 
04:38:54.189 --> 04:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
their populations either stable or
 
04:38:56.310 --> 04:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
diminishing and have to deal with all
 
04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
the issues that are involved in dealing
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
with the Contracting population such as
 
04:39:04.429 --> 04:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
closing schools combining school
 
04:39:06.510 --> 04:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
districts which if you want to upset a
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
community just talk about combining
 
04:39:12.189 --> 04:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
you hear a lot about New Hampshire's
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
population New Hampshire's percentage of
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
population over the age of
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
65 is eth in the United States there are
 
04:39:24.551 --> 04:39:24.561 align:start position:0%
you can see the states above it Maine
 
04:39:26.949 --> 04:39:26.959 align:start position:0%
has the oldest population in terms of
 
04:39:30.429 --> 04:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
percentage over 65 the median age in New
 
04:39:33.390 --> 04:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is higher it's the second
 
04:39:36.551 --> 04:39:36.561 align:start position:0%
oldest in terms of median age so even in
 
04:39:39.270 --> 04:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
terms of how we measure age New
 
04:39:41.948 --> 04:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's either
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the old one of the oldest States or
 
04:39:50.910 --> 04:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
age there's a lot of different kinds of
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
diversity in New Hampshire there's
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
racial and ethnic diversity this is how
 
04:39:59.070 --> 04:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
this is the diversity of the United
 
04:40:02.350 --> 04:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
States and this is the probabil the the
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
graphic is showing the chances that two
 
04:40:07.628 --> 04:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
people who randomly meet in the county
 
04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
what are the chances there are from the
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
same or from a different racial or
 
04:40:14.110 --> 04:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
ethnic group so the yellows and the
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
oranges are places where the population
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
is the most diverse the blues especially
 
04:40:21.270 --> 04:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
the dark Blues are the places where the
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
population is the least diverse where if
 
04:40:25.628 --> 04:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
you run into somebody else in your
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
county they're almost certainly going to
 
04:40:29.708 --> 04:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
be the same as
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
you this is a closeup just of New
 
04:40:36.030 --> 04:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
England so that you can see the variety
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
in uh diversities across New England
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
with Massachusetts being much more
 
04:40:42.590 --> 04:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
diverse than any of the Northern New
 
04:40:42.600 --> 04:40:45.830 align:start position:0%
diverse than any of the Northern New
England

04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:48.750 --> 04:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
states 12.8% of New Hampshire's
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
population was minority and by minority
 
04:40:55.230 --> 04:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
non-hispanic 12% 12.8% it's a little
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
higher now it's probably 13 and a half%
 
04:41:02.670 --> 04:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
I would
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
guess all of the growth in New
 
04:41:08.430 --> 04:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population that was from the
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
12.8% that are minority the minor
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
population in New Hampshire grew between
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
2010 and 2020 the white population
 
04:41:16.400 --> 04:41:19.070 align:start position:0%
2010 and 2020 the white population
didn't

04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
grow the child population in New
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the most diverse part of
 
04:41:26.190 --> 04:41:26.200 align:start position:0%
the population this is true across the
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
United States the most diverse
 
04:41:30.830 --> 04:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
population in the United States are the
 
04:41:33.390 --> 04:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
babies that were born this year the
 
04:41:36.230 --> 04:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
least diverse are the are the oldest
 
04:41:38.310 --> 04:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
parts of the population and you can see
 
04:41:41.310 --> 04:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
that's true in New Hampshire 20% of the
 
04:41:44.270 --> 04:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire in 2020 we're
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
minority compared to 11% of the adult
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
population so institutions that deal
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
with children are dealing with diversity
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
first it will come later to other parts
 
04:41:59.830 --> 04:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:02.030 --> 04:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
population this is change showing you
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
change in the size of the population
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
between 2010 and
 
04:42:09.070 --> 04:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
2023 the youth population the white
 
04:42:12.190 --> 04:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
child population diminish during that
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
period while the minority child
 
04:42:17.550 --> 04:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
population increased modestly the adult
 
04:42:19.868 --> 04:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
working age population that was white
 
04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
diminished during that period that loss
 
04:42:24.910 --> 04:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
was upset offset by an increase in the
 
04:42:27.948 --> 04:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
minority population in the working ages
 
04:42:30.070 --> 04:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
and then the older population in New
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the growth was almost
 
04:42:35.590 --> 04:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly non-hispanic white and
 
04:42:38.070 --> 04:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
again that's that Aging in place which
 
04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
is moving those people up the age
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
structure Through Time
 
04:42:44.590 --> 04:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
so again the population of New Hampshire
 
04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
although it's not one of the most
 
04:42:48.510 --> 04:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
diverse in the country it is becoming
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
more diverse and the diversity is coming
 
04:42:52.590 --> 04:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
from youngest to
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
oldest this is the distribution of the
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
population the minority population in
 
04:42:59.708 --> 04:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you can see large parts of
 
04:43:02.190 --> 04:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have virtually no
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
minorities in them or less than 10% that
 
04:43:07.390 --> 04:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
would be the greens but there are areas
 
04:43:09.310 --> 04:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
that are much more diverse again
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
underscoring the fact that
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
diversity varies in the state along a
 
04:43:16.270 --> 04:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
lot of different
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
dimensions here again is the child and
 
04:43:21.470 --> 04:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
the adult population in New Hampshire
 
04:43:24.830 --> 04:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
the diversity by Geographic areas and
 
04:43:27.510 --> 04:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
you can see that it's the child
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
population that is more
 
04:43:33.150 --> 04:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
diverse across the state whether you're
 
04:43:34.470 --> 04:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
talking about in the northern part of
 
04:43:36.190 --> 04:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
the state in the
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
Southeast it's always the child
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
population that's more diverse
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
underscoring that change that's coming
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
state this is the mash Manchester
 
04:43:50.910 --> 04:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
Corridor in other words right up that
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
the interstate between Manchester and
 
04:43:56.030 --> 04:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
nashaa this is how diverse the
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
population is in those areas on the left
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
is the total population so there are
 
04:44:04.110 --> 04:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
areas in Manchester that are more than
 
04:44:07.470 --> 04:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
40% minority and then the child
 
04:44:09.708 --> 04:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
population's on the right and you can
 
04:44:12.990 --> 04:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
see how much more widespread diversity
 
04:44:15.628 --> 04:44:15.638 align:start position:0%
is in that Urban
 
04:44:17.788 --> 04:44:17.798 align:start position:0%
Corridor than it is elsewhere in the
 
04:44:20.788 --> 04:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
state so within the state and within sub
 
04:44:24.230 --> 04:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
areas of the state there's a a range of
 
04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
diversity uh that has lots of
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
implications for lots of different
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.390 --> 04:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
agencies but that's not the only way as
 
04:44:36.030 --> 04:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
the state is diverse there's a lot of
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
other diversity in the state this is
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
income and education diversity
 
04:44:43.990 --> 04:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the state these data are from the
 
04:44:45.550 --> 04:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
time of the
 
04:44:49.230 --> 04:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
census uh I showed you the more recent
 
04:44:50.990 --> 04:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
data which shows a slightly higher
 
04:44:53.110 --> 04:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
proportion of the population having
 
04:44:55.230 --> 04:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degrees or more and higher
 
04:44:57.390 --> 04:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
incomes in the state but the patterns
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
are the same that is there are part
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
parts of the state which have extremely
 
04:45:04.110 --> 04:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
high income distributions and well
 
04:45:06.430 --> 04:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
educated populations and other parts
 
04:45:09.230 --> 04:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
that don't so
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
diversity ranges AC Ross a variety of
 
04:45:15.070 --> 04:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
different places this is poverty New
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is fortunate in having either
 
04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
the lowest or the next to the lowest
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
poverty rate in the United
 
04:45:23.550 --> 04:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
States only
 
04:45:26.310 --> 04:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
7.2% of the population currently is in
 
04:45:29.230 --> 04:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
poverty and only 7.8% of the children
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's extremely low numbers
 
04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
but that varies across the state there
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
are places in the state where a
 
04:45:40.230 --> 04:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
substantial part of the population or a
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
significant part is in poverty so just
 
04:45:45.868 --> 04:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
like there's diversity and population
 
04:45:49.070 --> 04:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
change and age structures and race
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
there's diversity along uh poverty lines
 
04:45:55.150 --> 04:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
these are gen these are just differences
 
04:45:57.708 --> 04:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
in college education levels and high
 
04:46:00.190 --> 04:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
school education Levels by race so you
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
can see that there's diversity there as
 
04:46:05.590 --> 04:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
well notice the extremely high level of
 
04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
college degrees or more among the Asian
 
04:46:13.110 --> 04:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:16.470 --> 04:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is just income by race so that you
 
04:46:18.150 --> 04:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
can see that there's variability and
 
04:46:20.150 --> 04:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
income across the state just like
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:28.230 --> 04:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
continuums so the blue bars are the
 
04:46:31.230 --> 04:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
lowest under under $50,000 of household
 
04:46:33.548 --> 04:46:33.558 align:start position:0%
income or family income and the yellow
 
04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
bars are over $150,000 a year of family
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
income so you can see the variation
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
there as well so again these things vary
 
04:46:44.190 --> 04:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
along geography they vary by race and
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
ethnicity this is poverty although again
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is blessed with extremely
 
04:46:52.190 --> 04:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
low poverty levels they do vary by
 
04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
racial and ethnic group across the state
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
just like they do
 
04:46:59.110 --> 04:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
geographically these data are all from
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
around the time of the census I just
 
04:47:03.510 --> 04:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
added and you don't have this slide
 
04:47:07.030 --> 04:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
again I I don't think do you no okay so
 
04:47:09.868 --> 04:47:09.878 align:start position:0%
this is just the newest data it shows
 
04:47:12.030 --> 04:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
much the same story
 
04:47:14.590 --> 04:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
the first bar the blue bar is percent
 
04:47:16.868 --> 04:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
with their bachelor's degrees or more
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
the second bar is the household income
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
distributions what percentage of the
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
households earn over
 
04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and then the third bar is
 
04:47:25.948 --> 04:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
poverty and you can see the story here
 
04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
is pretty much the same as it was in the
 
04:47:30.390 --> 04:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
graphics you have it's just that this is
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
the newest data that's
 
04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
available so again even in this small
 
04:47:37.868 --> 04:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
state there's a great deal of
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
variability along a lot of dimensions in
 
04:47:42.910 --> 04:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening in New Hampshire I know
 
04:47:45.110 --> 04:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
you're well aware of that but it's one
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
thing to know it from seeing it it's
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
another thing to see all the data so I
 
04:47:51.708 --> 04:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
hope that's helpful to
 
04:47:53.830 --> 04:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
you one of the things we've done a lot
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
of work on recently is this question
 
04:47:58.708 --> 04:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
since migration is so important to New
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've done quite a bit of
 
04:48:03.070 --> 04:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
research on why do people move to New
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or why do they stay in New
 
04:48:08.190 --> 04:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because a lot of the attention
 
04:48:11.708 --> 04:48:11.718 align:start position:0%
seems to be on attracting people to New
 
04:48:13.708 --> 04:48:13.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or and it's not just New
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all the states would be
 
04:48:17.548 --> 04:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
focused on this but the other part of it
 
04:48:21.310 --> 04:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
is retention of people if people stay in
 
04:48:21.320 --> 04:48:22.590 align:start position:0%
is retention of people if people stay in
New

04:48:22.590 --> 04:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they also continue to
 
04:48:27.310 --> 04:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
contribute to the state it's not just
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
attracting new people it's holding on to
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
the people that you have and so we've
 
04:48:34.110 --> 04:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
been we asked a variety of questions
 
04:48:37.788 --> 04:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
using the unh's granite state poll to
 
04:48:40.470 --> 04:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
survey thousands of people in two time
 
04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
period about
 
04:48:47.190 --> 04:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
this so we asked them in their own words
 
04:48:48.990 --> 04:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's this is not a check box where you
 
04:48:52.110 --> 04:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
go in and check a box but we asked them
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
what the three biggest reasons were for
 
04:48:56.910 --> 04:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
them to either have moved to New
 
04:48:58.750 --> 04:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they moved relatively
 
04:49:01.270 --> 04:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
recently or to stay in New Hampshire and
 
04:49:04.150 --> 04:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
then we coded all of that data into
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
categories so this is not the kind of
 
04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
standard survey where you are asked to
 
04:49:11.070 --> 04:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
check three things we asked them they
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
told us in their own words and we
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
translated it all which is an arduous
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
undertaking so what are the top reasons
 
04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
the blue bar is for recent migrants the
 
04:49:23.470 --> 04:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
people who've come to New Hampshire in
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
the last few years why did they
 
04:49:29.110 --> 04:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
come and the orange bar is for people
 
04:49:31.230 --> 04:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
who've lived in New Hampshire for at
 
04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
least 10 years why are they still here
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
what is it that that makes them stay in
 
04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you can see how
 
04:49:41.788 --> 04:49:41.798 align:start position:0%
important family is
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
to both of
 
04:49:45.708 --> 04:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
them and family means different things
 
04:49:48.310 --> 04:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
to people at different ages for older
 
04:49:51.150 --> 04:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
adults it might be that they want to be
 
04:49:54.030 --> 04:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
close to their grandchildren so if their
 
04:49:56.830 --> 04:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
fames in the Boston metropolitan area
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
and they want to be close to them they
 
04:50:01.230 --> 04:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
can stay in New Hampshire and be close
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
to them or if their kids are in New
 
04:50:05.548 --> 04:50:05.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and their grandchildren they
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
can move to New Hampshire and be near
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
them so that's what family means for
 
04:50:12.670 --> 04:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
older adult for younger adults it might
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
mean I wanted to be back close to my mom
 
04:50:17.910 --> 04:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
and dad so they could help with the
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
children or so they could see the
 
04:50:21.070 --> 04:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
children or so that we could be back
 
04:50:23.948 --> 04:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
with them natural environment I mean
 
04:50:25.788 --> 04:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
pretty much speaks for itself the beauty
 
04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire the Lakes the mountains
 
04:50:30.350 --> 04:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
lots of people talked about how
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
attractive that was to them both among
 
04:50:35.590 --> 04:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
those who live here already and among
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
people who migrate here Quality of Life
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
by quality of life people meant things
 
04:50:42.030 --> 04:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
like I feel comfortable with my
 
04:50:44.788 --> 04:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
neighbors I feel safe in my neighborhood
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
I like the rural kind of feel of the
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
place obviously employment would have
 
04:50:51.868 --> 04:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
been more important to the recent
 
04:50:53.548 --> 04:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
migrants if people are coming to New
 
04:50:55.708 --> 04:50:55.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one reason they may be coming
 
04:50:58.590 --> 04:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
is because of employment
 
04:51:00.868 --> 04:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
opportunities people mention taxes
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
although it's certainly not high on the
 
04:51:05.230 --> 04:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
list culture and lifestyle again they
 
04:51:08.430 --> 04:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
like the kind of rural Vibe the kind of
 
04:51:11.070 --> 04:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
laidback style of New Hampshire and then
 
04:51:12.830 --> 04:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
some people talk the about the economy
 
04:51:16.350 --> 04:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
in general so again a lot of different
 
04:51:18.030 --> 04:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
04:51:23.628 --> 04:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
people either stay here or come here and
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
one of the the other thing we found was
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
that people usually don't come or stay
 
04:51:31.628 --> 04:51:31.638 align:start position:0%
for one reason there's usually multiple
 
04:51:33.110 --> 04:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
reasons why they
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
come right so they might want to be
 
04:51:38.948 --> 04:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
close to their family but they also love
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
the natural environment or or they find
 
04:51:44.070 --> 04:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
the economic opportunities here
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
attractive but it also means it's a good
 
04:51:48.548 --> 04:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
social place to live it's a good place
 
04:51:51.430 --> 04:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
to raise a family
 
04:51:53.750 --> 04:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
so I mean if I would like you to take
 
04:51:56.670 --> 04:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
away from this that people move and stay
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for a variety of
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
reasons and again you can see what they
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
are economics physical Place
 
04:52:07.470 --> 04:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
family so as you're thinking about New
 
04:52:09.788 --> 04:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's future and about the
 
04:52:12.390 --> 04:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
importance of my migration recognize
 
04:52:13.470 --> 04:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
04:52:17.030 --> 04:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
both keeping people in New Hampshire and
 
04:52:20.750 --> 04:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
attracting people to New Hampshire so
 
04:52:22.548 --> 04:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
just to summarize that migration is
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
important to New
 
04:52:26.670 --> 04:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they move for multiple
 
04:52:29.190 --> 04:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
reasons when you think about
 
04:52:31.590 --> 04:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
policies think about those that might
 
04:52:34.270 --> 04:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
attract families or hold on to families
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
like quality of
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
Education things that preserve the
 
04:52:41.628 --> 04:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
state's natural beauty that enhance its
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
quality of life and that enhance its
 
04:52:45.990 --> 04:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities all of those
 
04:52:48.190 --> 04:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
are important and again people don't
 
04:52:50.470 --> 04:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
stay or leave for a single reason they
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's a matrix of reasons that they do so
 
04:52:55.788 --> 04:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
just to conclude my
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
talk population growth in New Hampshire
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
has slowed in the long term but it's
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's picked up
 
04:53:06.150 --> 04:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
recently migrations fueled all the
 
04:53:08.830 --> 04:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
recent growth in New Hampshire enough to
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
offset the excess of debt over
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
birth demographic change is uneven
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
across the state some parts of the state
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
are growing rapidly other parts of the
 
04:53:20.590 --> 04:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
state are either declining or not
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
growing very much at all the state
 
04:53:27.190 --> 04:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
is very much non-hispanic white but the
 
04:53:29.548 --> 04:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
diversity of the population's increasing
 
04:53:31.948 --> 04:53:31.958 align:start position:0%
and especially among young people in the
 
04:53:37.868 --> 04:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:41.430 --> 04:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
aging just couple more points migration
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to overemphasize
 
04:53:45.628 --> 04:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
migration but it demographically it's
 
04:53:47.948 --> 04:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
really bit important to the state it's a
 
04:53:49.750 --> 04:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
important source of human capital it
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
brings people it brings skills it brings
 
04:53:57.548 --> 04:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
education and that's not just attracting
 
04:53:59.548 --> 04:53:59.558 align:start position:0%
people but holding on to the people that
 
04:53:59.558 --> 04:54:01.030 align:start position:0%
people but holding on to the people that
you

04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:54:03.628 --> 04:54:03.638 align:start position:0%
have it's not a very diverse state but
 
04:54:05.390 --> 04:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's becoming more diverse people have
 
04:54:07.230 --> 04:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
to think about that as they plan for the
 
04:54:10.750 --> 04:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
future it's uneven and the age of the
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
concern um I think that the the older
 
04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
population is going to continue to grow
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
in New
 
04:54:20.240 --> 04:54:22.270 align:start position:0%
in New
Hampshire

04:54:22.270 --> 04:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
um so it's just one thing that has to be
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
born in mind along with all the other
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
issues that you face every day as you
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
try and do its best for the state thank
 
04:54:36.750 --> 04:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you um do we have
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
any questions for Dr Johnson
 
04:54:43.628 --> 04:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
04:54:43.638 --> 04:54:45.270 align:start position:0%
yes represent
Bolton

04:54:45.270 --> 04:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
Bolton
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
time so there are a couple of um first
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
of all it's a lot of data yeah I know
 
04:54:52.270 --> 04:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry just a couple of um things
 
04:54:53.868 --> 04:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
that I I always believed but I guess
 
04:54:56.070 --> 04:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
they probably shouldn't I thought there
 
04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
were two towns in New Hampshire that are
 
04:54:59.470 --> 04:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
actually getting younger but not like
 
04:55:02.628 --> 04:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
overly so that's Bethlehem and
 
04:55:05.030 --> 04:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
Littleton it may be I don't I well
 
04:55:06.670 --> 04:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
looking at your your data it certainly
 
04:55:09.548 --> 04:55:09.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't look that way so uh I'm not sure
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
if that's bragging rights or not um you
 
04:55:13.548 --> 04:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
send me an email I can look and find out
 
04:55:14.670 --> 04:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
for sure well I probably should sign up
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
for one of your classes actually but um
 
04:55:20.030 --> 04:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
I also have a question about like we
 
04:55:22.230 --> 04:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
hear that University
 
04:55:25.150 --> 04:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
system is not that well funded it hadn't
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
been for some some time and the fact
 
04:55:30.190 --> 04:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
that they can't offer incentives to get
 
04:55:32.670 --> 04:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire kids to enroll
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
because it's cheaper going out of state
 
04:55:38.190 --> 04:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
or and there were two rationals of why
 
04:55:39.868 --> 04:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
it' be important to keep the New
 
04:55:42.430 --> 04:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire kids here because well first
 
04:55:45.310 --> 04:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
of all uh our state is aging second of
 
04:55:48.510 --> 04:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
all we need them to land where there's
 
04:55:50.670 --> 04:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
employment and a good good environment
 
04:55:52.990 --> 04:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
to raise their kids and it also looks
 
04:55:54.990 --> 04:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
like if we we basically are going to be
 
04:55:57.350 --> 04:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
dependent upon you know like immigrants
 
04:55:59.230 --> 04:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts or something which
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
are pretty much providing Our Hope and
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
Dreams by moving into our state having
 
04:56:07.750 --> 04:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
kids and so I'm I'm just kind of like uh
 
04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
concerned that a solution Le the New
 
04:56:12.788 --> 04:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire problem would be fund the
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
univers system with more money and get
 
04:56:18.230 --> 04:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
um good employment
 
04:56:18.240 --> 04:56:19.788 align:start position:0%
um good employment
opportunities

04:56:19.788 --> 04:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
04:56:19.798 --> 04:56:21.990 align:start position:0%
opportunities
and

04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's part of that whole
 
04:56:28.910 --> 04:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
population retention issue that that so
 
04:56:30.590 --> 04:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
much attention has been paid to
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
attracting people that not enough has
 
04:56:35.470 --> 04:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
been paid to holding on to the people
 
04:56:37.548 --> 04:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
the good people we already have in the
 
04:56:40.270 --> 04:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
state so anything that would increase
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
least the likelihood that people would
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
be staying is is important um certainly
 
04:56:50.110 --> 04:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
the university system is a valuable
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
resource to the state
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
um I spent a lot of my I mean I grew up
 
04:56:57.240 --> 04:56:58.030 align:start position:0%
um I spent a lot of my I mean I grew up
in

04:56:58.030 --> 04:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:57:00.350 --> 04:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
Michigan when I went to college I didn't
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
even think about it anywhere other than
 
04:57:05.590 --> 04:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
the state universities in Michigan um
 
04:57:07.230 --> 04:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
because they were less expensive but
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
also because I'd been there I'd seen
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
them I knew what they were like um I
 
04:57:14.310 --> 04:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
think that's important here in New
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire too that that that kids feel
 
04:57:20.070 --> 04:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they can go I mean the University
 
04:57:21.548 --> 04:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is an exceptionally
 
04:57:24.670 --> 04:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
good school actually um sometimes people
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
locally don't appreciate that but it is
 
04:57:29.670 --> 04:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
a good school certainly it would be
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
you'd get a fine education there it
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful if more kids from New
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would go to the University of
 
04:57:40.390 --> 04:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um
 
04:57:43.590 --> 04:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't disagree with you at all
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
there and just to identify myself I'm
 
04:57:49.070 --> 04:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
from Plymouth so um okay of course I'll
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
be concerned about you know no I I meant
 
04:57:52.910 --> 04:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire syst no
 
04:57:56.708 --> 04:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
no no I but yeah I I fully support
 
04:57:58.708 --> 04:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
supporting UNH and the other
 
04:58:01.948 --> 04:58:01.958 align:start position:0%
universities so thank you you know it's
 
04:58:03.990 --> 04:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
interesting I I think it was a
 
04:58:05.708 --> 04:58:05.718 align:start position:0%
legislator when I was here a few years
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
ago said to me she said I understand
 
04:58:11.788 --> 04:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
that my kids going to go away when she's
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
20 I just want her to come back when
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
she's 25 and I mean I think that's
 
04:58:20.110 --> 04:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
another important thing to recognize is
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
that a lot of and this is true not just
 
04:58:24.830 --> 04:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but in any part of the
 
04:58:26.948 --> 04:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
United States young adults in their
 
04:58:29.230 --> 04:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
early 20s are attracted to large urban
 
04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
areas where there's a lot of excitement
 
04:58:33.868 --> 04:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.548 --> 04:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
energy when they reach another stage of
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
the life cycle when they're in their
 
04:58:40.350 --> 04:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
late 20s and early 30s they start think
 
04:58:42.910 --> 04:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
about the world differently and I think
 
04:58:45.510 --> 04:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
part of that bump you see in those data
 
04:58:47.670 --> 04:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
of old of people in their 30s and 40s
 
04:58:49.510 --> 04:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
coming to Hampshire some of that is
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
return migration some of that's people
 
04:58:56.190 --> 04:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
coming back so even if we can't hold on
 
04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
to them in their early 20s it would be
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
good if the if they feel good about the
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
state and feel they can come back and
 
04:59:04.470 --> 04:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's where they want to raise their
 
04:59:07.350 --> 04:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:10.110 --> 04:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
example other questions yes
 
04:59:11.948 --> 04:59:11.958 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker uh thank you Professor for
 
04:59:16.830 --> 04:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
sharing this information with us um you
 
04:59:19.350 --> 04:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned a lot of reasons um for people
 
04:59:21.390 --> 04:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
coming to the state what are the reasons
 
04:59:23.948 --> 04:59:23.958 align:start position:0%
that the migrants give for leaving yeah
 
04:59:25.548 --> 04:59:25.558 align:start position:0%
the state that's a wonderful question
 
04:59:28.510 --> 04:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
that I would dearly like an answer to
 
04:59:31.788 --> 04:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very difficult question to
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
get an answer to because you have
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
to essentially know where they went so
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
that you can ask them the question so
 
04:59:42.990 --> 04:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
the survey data that we use from New
 
04:59:45.070 --> 04:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire obviously it's for people who
 
04:59:47.548 --> 04:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
are here if they've left we don't have
 
04:59:50.590 --> 04:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
as much data on them so it's a I don't
 
04:59:52.990 --> 04:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
have a clear answer to why they're
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
leaving I wish I did it's just it's
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:05.430 --> 05:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
get yes represent
 
05:00:08.590 --> 05:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
opal uh thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
05:00:10.750 --> 05:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Johnson for this
 
05:00:14.948 --> 05:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
um I do have a student at UNH so um
 
05:00:19.510 --> 05:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do my best um I'm wondering if
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
in order to get the answer to uh
 
05:00:23.548 --> 05:00:23.558 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's question that
 
05:00:27.390 --> 05:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
you'd like is it possible to use uh
 
05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
voter registration data I mean if you're
 
05:00:31.430 --> 05:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
moving out of state you're going to
 
05:00:33.628 --> 05:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
change your registration to another
 
05:00:37.390 --> 05:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
state and I'm wondering if um I know
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's a a national system that I think
 
05:00:42.788 --> 05:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has withdrawn from but um I'm
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if that might be a source of
 
05:00:46.350 --> 05:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
that the answer to that question of of
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
reaching out to contact those people as
 
05:00:50.190 --> 05:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
they change their voter registration
 
05:00:50.200 --> 05:00:52.590 align:start position:0%
they change their voter registration
yeah

05:00:52.590 --> 05:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
um again it's a it's a d i mean we
 
05:00:58.270 --> 05:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'll get you can get some
 
05:01:00.868 --> 05:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
kind of the checkbox data I move for a
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
job or I move but to get into the data
 
05:01:06.110 --> 05:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
the way we were able to talk to people
 
05:01:07.948 --> 05:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
and actually get them to answer in their
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
own words it would it would would be a
 
05:01:12.910 --> 05:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing to do I just I'll give
 
05:01:15.150 --> 05:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
it some more thought but it's just it
 
05:01:19.030 --> 05:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
would be very expensive to to do it
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
so representative wer think real estate
 
05:01:24.480 --> 05:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
so representative wer think real estate

people true if they're of that age group
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
and they're they're have the resources
 
05:01:40.350 --> 05:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
to buy or sell a house I mean when we're
 
05:01:41.548 --> 05:01:41.558 align:start position:0%
talking about young adults in their
 
05:01:44.230 --> 05:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
early 20s they're not going to likely
 
05:01:44.240 --> 05:01:45.150 align:start position:0%
early 20s they're not going to likely
have

05:01:45.150 --> 05:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:01:48.350 --> 05:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
that but it's an I mean it's a good
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
idea and to that point represent wer we
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
do have uh tomorrow Bob Quinn from New
 
05:01:55.868 --> 05:01:55.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors maybe
 
05:01:57.670 --> 05:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's a good question to ask him
 
05:02:00.430 --> 05:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr chair uh
 
05:02:02.750 --> 05:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
living in the bag Metropolis of Chai
 
05:02:04.590 --> 05:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
Chester we're having a housing boom
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
which is more like a trickle but the
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
observation i' I've come up with is that
 
05:02:12.270 --> 05:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
the people are moving back they've been
 
05:02:14.350 --> 05:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
out of state they're moving back with
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
their children some of the children are
 
05:02:19.628 --> 05:02:19.638 align:start position:0%
maybe some in school still some are just
 
05:02:21.590 --> 05:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
out of school but that's what that's
 
05:02:26.070 --> 05:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
area yeah I mean I I've heard I heard
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
from some of the school districts up
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
north early in the pandemic that all of
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
a sudden they had more kids in each
 
05:02:39.548 --> 05:02:39.558 align:start position:0%
grade I mean like in a small school
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
district district 10 or 15 more kids is
 
05:02:43.708 --> 05:02:43.718 align:start position:0%
a lot because it might mean a new
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
teacher uh and they were their big worry
 
05:02:49.390 --> 05:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
was was this temporary was it just for
 
05:02:51.750 --> 05:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
the next couple years or was it
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
permanent and so I think we're only
 
05:02:56.390 --> 05:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
beginning to see now the answers to
 
05:02:58.270 --> 05:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
those questions and it's it's a it's an
 
05:02:58.280 --> 05:02:59.788 align:start position:0%
those questions and it's it's a it's an
important

05:02:59.788 --> 05:02:59.798 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:02:59.798 --> 05:03:01.470 align:start position:0%
important
question

05:03:01.470 --> 05:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
good all right uh thank you Dr Johnson

today um and just a little bit about
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
what the department does and um the
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
focus of that is on uh Brian's Bureau
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
with the economic and labor market
 
05:05:47.830 --> 05:05:47.840 align:start position:0%

market analysts and and economists um
 
05:05:55.590 --> 05:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
that uh run that unit housed within
 
05:05:57.030 --> 05:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
Employment Security so that's really
 
05:05:59.788 --> 05:05:59.798 align:start position:0%
going to be what's uh largely on display
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh today during our presentation and the
 
05:06:03.948 --> 05:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
work that they do um but the the
 
05:06:05.910 --> 05:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
department also administers the state's
 
05:06:08.270 --> 05:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment program both the collection
 
05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
of Revenue and and the um distribution
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
of benefits to eligible individuals and
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
we also operate all of the state's New
 
05:06:17.830 --> 05:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Works offices so the the
 
05:06:19.990 --> 05:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
network of 12 American job Centers
 
05:06:22.750 --> 05:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
located conveniently or we we think
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
conveniently for most folks uh
 
05:06:26.670 --> 05:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the state uh where people can
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
go in um um receive assistance with
 
05:06:32.310 --> 05:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
Reemployment efforts um or to get
 
05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
questions answered with regard to
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits um so with that
 
05:06:39.990 --> 05:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
quick um recap of what the department is
 
05:06:41.788 --> 05:06:41.798 align:start position:0%
all about I'll turn it over to Brian to
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
get us
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
started terrific Thank you Rich um
 
05:06:49.150 --> 05:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
couple of things before I get into the
 
05:06:51.868 --> 05:06:51.878 align:start position:0%
data um I want to make one thing very
 
05:06:53.548 --> 05:06:53.558 align:start position:0%
clear some of the things that we'll talk
 
05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
about today um we're going to talk about
 
05:06:58.708 --> 05:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
the national economy because that really
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
sets the stage for what's going to
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
happen in the New Hampshire economy um
 
05:07:06.390 --> 05:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
we'll also touch on some issues that are
 
05:07:09.788 --> 05:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
pretty hot bed at the moment um and and
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
I really feel the need to say that we
 
05:07:14.470 --> 05:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't address them from a political
 
05:07:16.510 --> 05:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
perspective at all an ideological
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
perspective but we do address them
 
05:07:21.070 --> 05:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
because they have the potential to
 
05:07:22.750 --> 05:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
affect the labor force and if they
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
affect the labor force they have the
 
05:07:27.430 --> 05:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
potential to affect employment I also uh
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
we'll talk a little bit about some of
 
05:07:30.390 --> 05:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
the things that Professor Johnson talked
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
maybe with a little different focus and
 
05:07:35.150 --> 05:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
if he's behind me um he may I'm going to
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
take a look just in case I say anything
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
that dramatically disagrees with him
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
Rich cover my back
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
please um just to go over uh and the
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
overall Outlook what we'll uh address in
 
05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
in case very good chance I lose you u in
 
05:07:55.070 --> 05:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
my comments um this forms our overall
 
05:07:57.708 --> 05:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
Judgment of what's likely to happen uh
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
in 2005 one the US economy is performing
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
well um the probability of recession is
 
05:08:06.390 --> 05:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
quite low in 2025 from our perspective
 
05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
um the job losses nationally and in New
 
05:08:11.070 --> 05:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are low and and exceptionally
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
low as Rich will mention um and point
 
05:08:15.788 --> 05:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
out later in the presentation by
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
historical standards we're in a really
 
05:08:20.670 --> 05:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
good position there um a key a real key
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
is that consumer spending nationally is
 
05:08:25.868 --> 05:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
is strong wages have been rising faster
 
05:08:28.150 --> 05:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
than inflation that means consumers uh
 
05:08:29.830 --> 05:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable in spending and
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
continuing to spend with the low layoffs
 
05:08:36.510 --> 05:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
and and Rising incomes um and I should
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
have put this in question mark
 
05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
moderating inflation because it does
 
05:08:43.070 --> 05:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
seem to have gotten a little bit
 
05:08:45.548 --> 05:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
stickier and along with that hopefully
 
05:08:48.030 --> 05:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
lower interest rates um that's kind of
 
05:08:51.948 --> 05:08:51.958 align:start position:0%
the scenario for a positive 2025 Outlook
 
05:08:54.070 --> 05:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
um importantly in New Hampshire we feel
 
05:08:56.430 --> 05:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
like we're beginning 2025 with some
 
05:08:59.190 --> 05:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
upward momentum and I'll show you why
 
05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
come to that conclusion some uh
 
05:09:04.030 --> 05:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
difficult things uh or some positive
 
05:09:07.070 --> 05:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
other positive things um the June uh
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
since June New Hampshire's rate of
 
05:09:11.350 --> 05:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
private sector job growth has actually
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
exceeded that of the US and um can't say
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
that um a lot over the last um year or
 
05:09:20.830 --> 05:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
so um largely because of our labor force
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
constraints um big Improvement and one
 
05:09:25.990 --> 05:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why our employment is
 
05:09:29.190 --> 05:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
growing faster at the moment is we have
 
05:09:31.390 --> 05:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
new businesses that have been starting
 
05:09:34.390 --> 05:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
at a rate faster than than the nation
 
05:09:36.548 --> 05:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
overall so a lot of entrepreneurial
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
activity a lot of new business starts
 
05:09:41.430 --> 05:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
big issue ues problematic you heard some
 
05:09:43.830 --> 05:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
of them from um Professor Johnson we'll
 
05:09:46.590 --> 05:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
talk uh about them more from a labor
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
market perspective the demographics and
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
labor constraints that we face really
 
05:09:53.430 --> 05:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
are the one significant challenge that I
 
05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
see for our for our economic growth um
 
05:09:58.548 --> 05:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
supporting movement into New Hampshire
 
05:10:00.510 --> 05:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
is key to population and labor force
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
growth you heard that we'll show you
 
05:10:05.788 --> 05:10:05.798 align:start position:0%
some slides um you know where we may
 
05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
disagree a little bit is in terms of the
 
05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
need to keep people people um every
 
05:10:12.868 --> 05:10:12.878 align:start position:0%
rural state in the nation loses young
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
people for a period of time hopefully
 
05:10:16.830 --> 05:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
they do come back it's very difficult to
 
05:10:19.590 --> 05:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
keep those individuals um in their more
 
05:10:19.600 --> 05:10:20.708 align:start position:0%
keep those individuals um in their more
rural

05:10:20.708 --> 05:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
rural
 
05:10:23.430 --> 05:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
States and housing shortages you'll hear
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
a lot about that you'll be dealing with
 
05:10:27.230 --> 05:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
those issues they really are
 
05:10:29.548 --> 05:10:29.558 align:start position:0%
exacerbating our demographic challenges
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
if we need to attract people um to grow
 
05:10:33.788 --> 05:10:33.798 align:start position:0%
our labor force and ultimately our
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
employment then we have to have places
 
05:10:37.548 --> 05:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
to house them and right now that is a
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
very significant challenge
 
05:10:41.830 --> 05:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
so with that long
 
05:10:44.190 --> 05:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
introduction um this is the key right
 
05:10:47.310 --> 05:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
here to why this first chart why um we
 
05:10:50.430 --> 05:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
feel positive about the direction of the
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
economy this chart shows two things
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
inflation which is the red line
 
05:10:58.350 --> 05:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
obviously it spiked at over 9% it has
 
05:11:00.470 --> 05:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
come down it was coming down pretty
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
rapidly it has eased in terms of
 
05:11:06.110 --> 05:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
moderation more recently and actually up
 
05:11:08.430 --> 05:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
ticked a little bit in the most recent
 
05:11:11.868 --> 05:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
month the the green line is nationally
 
05:11:15.708 --> 05:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
average wage growth year-over-year big
 
05:11:19.070 --> 05:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
problem in that shaded area was
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
inflation Rising faster than wages when
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
that happens consumers are constrained
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of not good things can happen
 
05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
in the economy but for almost two years
 
05:11:33.430 --> 05:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
now wage growth has
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
exceeded inflation and that means
 
05:11:39.868 --> 05:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
consumers feel comfortable spending
 
05:11:42.750 --> 05:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
um and it provides a significant lift uh
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:11:47.190 --> 05:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
economy that is shown in this chart
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
which is real cons real inflation
 
05:11:51.910 --> 05:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
adjusted consumer expenditures
 
05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
year-over-year through November so what
 
05:11:58.350 --> 05:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
we see is that uh consumer expenditures
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
on a real basis above inflation are
 
05:12:04.628 --> 05:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
holding up very well if that's occurring
 
05:12:07.830 --> 05:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
consumer expenditures are 70% make up
 
05:12:12.110 --> 05:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
70% of the nation's GDP it's very very
 
05:12:17.150 --> 05:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
Trend another positive um and a and
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a reversal small businesses
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
which are really critical in New
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire small businesses for much of
 
05:12:31.110 --> 05:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
the past several years have shown
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
declining optimism and why would that be
 
05:12:36.670 --> 05:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
in an economy that is ostensibly been
 
05:12:38.910 --> 05:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
performing pretty well well you think
 
05:12:38.920 --> 05:12:39.948 align:start position:0%
performing pretty well well you think
about

05:12:39.948 --> 05:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
factors that have affected the national
 
05:12:44.430 --> 05:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
economy over the last couple years
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
Rising wages as you saw and Rising
 
05:12:49.310 --> 05:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
inflation and material prices goods and
 
05:12:53.270 --> 05:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
material prices well small businesses
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
are affected most dramatically in those
 
05:12:58.110 --> 05:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances bigger businesses have the
 
05:13:00.868 --> 05:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
ability to accommodate they don't love
 
05:13:03.670 --> 05:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
it but higher wages and they can
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
accommodate higher
 
05:13:09.150 --> 05:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
material costs small businesses all
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
always take it on the chin in those
 
05:13:14.350 --> 05:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances um the one aspect of this
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
chart is you see a big jump in optimism
 
05:13:19.868 --> 05:13:19.878 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of traditional uh with a
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
republican Administration small
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
businesses generally feel more
 
05:13:25.670 --> 05:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
optimistic I will tell you another re
 
05:13:28.590 --> 05:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
why this is an important chart for me is
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
that I've tracked how this survey um
 
05:13:35.110 --> 05:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
correlates with uh job growth in New
 
05:13:37.510 --> 05:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and while it's not a obviously
 
05:13:38.788 --> 05:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
a straight line correlation New
 
05:13:40.628 --> 05:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has so many businesses it does
 
05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
tend to track fairly well so um it it's
 
05:13:46.590 --> 05:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
another reason to be optimistic about
 
05:13:48.670 --> 05:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
job growth in New
 
05:13:52.590 --> 05:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mentioned that since uh June
 
05:13:55.548 --> 05:13:55.558 align:start position:0%
or since the summer New Hampshire has
 
05:13:57.670 --> 05:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
seen faster job growth year-over-year
 
05:13:59.868 --> 05:13:59.878 align:start position:0%
private sector job growth which we focus
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
on I focus on um as a measure of what's
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
happening in the real economy um has
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
been growing faster than the nation um
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
overall some very positive upward
 
05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
momentum ending the year after spending
 
05:14:15.230 --> 05:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
much of the last couple of years just a
 
05:14:18.270 --> 05:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
little bit slower solid still solid
 
05:14:20.670 --> 05:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
employment growth but but now exceeding
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
the national rate of growth um one
 
05:14:25.548 --> 05:14:25.558 align:start position:0%
survey that I have been paying attention
 
05:14:28.390 --> 05:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
to relatively recently is done by the US
 
05:14:30.510 --> 05:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
Census Bureau every two weeks and it
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
asks businesses in every state and this
 
05:14:36.350 --> 05:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
reflects New Hampshire uh a number of
 
05:14:38.270 --> 05:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions and one of the questions is
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
overall How would you describe this
 
05:14:43.948 --> 05:14:43.958 align:start position:0%
business's C current performance either
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
excellent um above average or below
 
05:14:50.190 --> 05:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
average poor or about the same and I
 
05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
take a net of that respon those
 
05:14:54.230 --> 05:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
responses for New Hampshire every two
 
05:14:56.430 --> 05:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
weeks and average them over a month and
 
05:14:59.310 --> 05:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
what you see is been an uptick you a
 
05:15:01.230 --> 05:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
pretty positive more businesses are
 
05:15:02.788 --> 05:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
positive about how their businesses are
 
05:15:06.110 --> 05:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
performing and it has uptick about since
 
05:15:09.430 --> 05:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
that time when we started seeing the
 
05:15:11.590 --> 05:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
employment numbers exceed the national
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
so I do think there's a relationship
 
05:15:16.830 --> 05:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
there again a reason to be optimistic
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
about 2025 I mentioned that the
 
05:15:22.510 --> 05:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial activity in the state um
 
05:15:24.628 --> 05:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
this is new business formations it's
 
05:15:26.590 --> 05:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
based on applications for employer
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
identification numbers and I take a
 
05:15:31.310 --> 05:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
subset of those from among businesses
 
05:15:34.548 --> 05:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
not who are not um sole Proprietors but
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
are businesses that are likely to have
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
employers manufacturers businesses
 
05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
generally have employees and you see
 
05:15:45.750 --> 05:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
taking the 2020 year as the base year
 
05:15:47.990 --> 05:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
and seeing the percentage change in New
 
05:15:50.110 --> 05:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire always the red line and the
 
05:15:53.868 --> 05:15:53.878 align:start position:0%
black line the us our rate of
 
05:15:55.788 --> 05:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial activity new business
 
05:15:58.390 --> 05:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
formations has significantly exceeded
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
the national average and that generally
 
05:16:01.788 --> 05:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
means there's going to be more highes
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
and I think we're seeing that reflected
 
05:16:07.270 --> 05:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
now looking at how New Hampshire
 
05:16:10.548 --> 05:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
compares to all other states 50 states
 
05:16:12.510 --> 05:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this is a a little bit
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
difficult one without the colors but
 
05:16:18.910 --> 05:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
this measures private sector job
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
growth from prior to the pandemic peak
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
in every state so Most states it was
 
05:16:27.548 --> 05:16:27.558 align:start position:0%
February of 2020 some states it was a
 
05:16:29.310 --> 05:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
little bit sooner New Hampshire it was
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
February of
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
2020 how many what percentage of private
 
05:16:36.750 --> 05:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
sector jobs have we added since that
 
05:16:39.868 --> 05:16:39.878 align:start position:0%
Peak prior Peak and what this chart
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
shows is that we're much better than our
 
05:16:45.430 --> 05:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
neighbors in New England but beyond that
 
05:16:47.230 --> 05:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
we're also much better than the
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
Northeast overall and why is that well
 
05:16:52.350 --> 05:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
it's important for a number of reasons
 
05:16:54.548 --> 05:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
shows how competitive we are in a region
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
that is difficult has had difficulty
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
competing nationally the states at the
 
05:17:02.110 --> 05:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
far right that have seen the highest
 
05:17:03.788 --> 05:17:03.798 align:start position:0%
rate of job growth are states that
 
05:17:05.788 --> 05:17:05.798 align:start position:0%
generally didn't have the kind of
 
05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
efforts to control the pandemic that
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
Northeastern states did Northeastern
 
05:17:14.070 --> 05:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
states being more populous more densely
 
05:17:16.670 --> 05:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
populated had to take measures uh more
 
05:17:20.310 --> 05:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
severely in order to control uh the
 
05:17:23.628 --> 05:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
pandemic and uh with that I'll let um
 
05:17:23.638 --> 05:17:24.750 align:start position:0%
pandemic and uh with that I'll let um
Deputy

05:17:24.750 --> 05:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
Deputy
 
05:17:27.390 --> 05:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
La so with with the growth that you saw
 
05:17:30.750 --> 05:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
in the prior chart from Brian nearly 5%
 
05:17:33.470 --> 05:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh private sector job growth since the
 
05:17:36.190 --> 05:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
peak prior to the pandemic obviously um
 
05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
it has not been evenly experienced
 
05:17:42.030 --> 05:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
across all sectors and so this slide you
 
05:17:44.910 --> 05:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
can see uh the change in employment
 
05:17:47.948 --> 05:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
since the first quarter of 2020 so this
 
05:17:51.708 --> 05:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
is measured by looking at the uh
 
05:17:54.230 --> 05:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
administrative uh reports that are filed
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
by employers each quarter uh so this is
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
really a gold standard of um of
 
05:18:02.548 --> 05:18:02.558 align:start position:0%
reporting where these are actual numbers
 
05:18:05.350 --> 05:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
as reported by employers and so here you
 
05:18:07.990 --> 05:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
can see that the growth within the the
 
05:18:10.350 --> 05:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
job growth with than the professional uh
 
05:18:12.590 --> 05:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
scientific and Technical Services
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
industry so Professional Services um is
 
05:18:20.430 --> 05:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
really um outpaced that of uh growth and
 
05:18:24.350 --> 05:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
change in any other sector um from a uh
 
05:18:28.948 --> 05:18:28.958 align:start position:0%
that 9, nearly 9,300 job gain it's about
 
05:18:28.958 --> 05:18:30.350 align:start position:0%
that 9, nearly 9,300 job gain it's about
a

05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:18:33.548 --> 05:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
24% increase compared to prior to the
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic um so it's a um well-paying
 
05:18:41.390 --> 05:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
sector um you see you've got uh not only
 
05:18:44.110 --> 05:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
your professional type services but you
 
05:18:46.548 --> 05:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
have research and development uh you
 
05:18:49.830 --> 05:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
have Consulting so a lot of growth uh
 
05:18:52.270 --> 05:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
within the sector um in terms of the
 
05:18:55.390 --> 05:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
number of jobs um the sector also as you
 
05:18:57.910 --> 05:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
can imagine um from a from a
 
05:19:00.110 --> 05:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
Professional Services standpoint it also
 
05:19:03.030 --> 05:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
offers a lot of flexibility with regard
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
to uh scheduling flexibility location
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
flexibility with remote work opport
 
05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
opportunities and as as we continue to
 
05:19:15.310 --> 05:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
see that being a an important factor
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
particularly for younger workers uh that
 
05:19:20.948 --> 05:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
have uh their ideas and demands about
 
05:19:24.270 --> 05:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
work life balance uh that is an industry
 
05:19:26.990 --> 05:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
that can really uh provide a lot to
 
05:19:30.548 --> 05:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
those workers um and attract them to to
 
05:19:33.510 --> 05:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
those types of jobs um a but a lot of
 
05:19:36.310 --> 05:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
growth here within uh business services
 
05:19:38.110 --> 05:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
and administrative support that's about
 
05:19:43.070 --> 05:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
an 11 % gain um and uh construction um
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
about a
 
05:19:47.830 --> 05:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
133% uh gain as you can see here um but
 
05:19:50.830 --> 05:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
when we move to the bottom um of this
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
chart you can see those sectors that
 
05:19:57.070 --> 05:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
have struggled to regain their pre
 
05:20:01.628 --> 05:20:01.638 align:start position:0%
pandemic um employment numbers um so um
 
05:20:04.868 --> 05:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
some government sectors here uh but some
 
05:20:06.990 --> 05:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
important ones to note with our
 
05:20:10.230 --> 05:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals um Hospital employment uh down
 
05:20:13.110 --> 05:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
about 3% compared to where they were
 
05:20:16.190 --> 05:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic um you can uh
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
compare that um against the Ambulatory
 
05:20:22.708 --> 05:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
Care um sector both uh you know healthc
 
05:20:25.030 --> 05:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
care employers Ambulatory Care providing
 
05:20:28.830 --> 05:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
outpatient services um Ambulatory Care
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
um uh a growth of about 7% so uh compare
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
that with the the hospitals still being
 
05:20:40.750 --> 05:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
3% down compared to where they were pre
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic um skilled nursing
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
so a long-term care Community uh they
 
05:20:48.868 --> 05:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
are about even where they were prior to
 
05:20:51.390 --> 05:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um and then at the bottom
 
05:20:53.548 --> 05:20:53.558 align:start position:0%
of this chart local government and uh
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
retail uh both both down uh
 
05:20:58.990 --> 05:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
significantly from where they were
 
05:21:00.310 --> 05:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
question Mr
 
05:21:02.708 --> 05:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
chairman is there a chance to ask a
 
05:21:05.030 --> 05:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
question here do you mind questions in
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
the middle of your presentation uh
 
05:21:07.948 --> 05:21:07.958 align:start position:0%
whenever people would like to ask them
 
05:21:09.430 --> 05:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead representative thank
 
05:21:11.948 --> 05:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
05:21:14.948 --> 05:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking this question I
 
05:21:18.510 --> 05:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
look at manufacturing down here uh the
 
05:21:18.520 --> 05:21:21.230 align:start position:0%
look at manufacturing down here uh the
decrease

05:21:21.230 --> 05:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
05:21:26.070 --> 05:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh has tax rate adjustments downward
 
05:21:28.150 --> 05:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
going to improve the manufacturing end
 
05:21:33.310 --> 05:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:36.910 --> 05:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
the companies that are basically in the
 
05:21:39.910 --> 05:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
field of making things to ship come out
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
does the tax rate going down make a
 
05:21:44.670 --> 05:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
difference in the number of uh employees
 
05:21:45.868 --> 05:21:45.878 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
05:21:48.830 --> 05:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
hiring um well Brian and I will both
 
05:21:51.628 --> 05:21:51.638 align:start position:0%
take a stab at this one and all all of
 
05:21:53.628 --> 05:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
those costs associated with cost of
 
05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
production are going to are going to
 
05:21:58.750 --> 05:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
have an impact it's about a
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
2% uh drop of that number represents
 
05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
from where manufacturers were uh prior
 
05:22:08.270 --> 05:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
to the prior to the pandemic um so I
 
05:22:10.110 --> 05:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
think there there could be some good and
 
05:22:13.708 --> 05:22:13.718 align:start position:0%
some bad with policy discussions um that
 
05:22:16.190 --> 05:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
could be impacting those total costs as
 
05:22:20.548 --> 05:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
they look um U into 2025 and
 
05:22:23.230 --> 05:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
Beyond yeah I I mean costs are always
 
05:22:25.548 --> 05:22:25.558 align:start position:0%
important um in terms of the issues that
 
05:22:27.150 --> 05:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
are affecting manufacturing at the
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
moment um one thing that should be made
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
clear is that while we are seeing and we
 
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a lot of manufacturing
 
05:22:35.390 --> 05:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
growth productivity in the manufacturing
 
05:22:37.270 --> 05:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
sector has increased pretty
 
05:22:40.470 --> 05:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
significantly um one that means for an
 
05:22:42.110 --> 05:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
individual company they may be able to
 
05:22:44.990 --> 05:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
do more with fewer people um but also
 
05:22:47.230 --> 05:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a change overall in the
 
05:22:49.830 --> 05:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
industry structure in manufacturing
 
05:22:53.990 --> 05:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
going from less uh more labor intensive
 
05:22:56.590 --> 05:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh manufacturers to less labor intensive
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
where more technology is being is
 
05:23:02.708 --> 05:23:02.718 align:start position:0%
invested in the product than than labor
 
05:23:04.750 --> 05:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
um and one of the issues that's
 
05:23:06.430 --> 05:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
confronting manufacturers and this was
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
true during the pandemic is that they
 
05:23:11.830 --> 05:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
have a hard time finding people one it's
 
05:23:13.830 --> 05:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
an it tends to be an older Workforce or
 
05:23:15.868 --> 05:23:15.878 align:start position:0%
it has been an older Workforce so a lot
 
05:23:18.590 --> 05:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
of retirements over the last decade um
 
05:23:22.270 --> 05:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
and will continue and you compound that
 
05:23:25.708 --> 05:23:25.718 align:start position:0%
with changing Technologies which means
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know you have to train in a lot of
 
05:23:30.830 --> 05:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
ways a new work a new Workforce um
 
05:23:32.590 --> 05:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
because there's just new technologies
 
05:23:34.590 --> 05:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
that there is an existing Workforce for
 
05:23:38.470 --> 05:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
so a lot of factors long answer yeah and
 
05:23:41.190 --> 05:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
that technology there is key uh but also
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
um thinking more U about that one of the
 
05:23:45.948 --> 05:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
earlier comments too about some of the
 
05:23:48.350 --> 05:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
flexibilities that some of the sectors
 
05:23:50.788 --> 05:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
that have gained employment uh since
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic um difficult to
 
05:23:54.910 --> 05:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
offer some of those flexibilities within
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing space uh so that that
 
05:24:00.830 --> 05:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
can also be a difficult uh headwind for
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
them as more and more people um are
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
looking for opportunities that have that
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
um within their that uh job offer do we
 
05:24:10.788 --> 05:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
know about the companies themselves
 
05:24:13.310 --> 05:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're you're representing the number of
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
people lost how about are we losing
 
05:24:18.910 --> 05:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing companies or do we
 
05:24:21.868 --> 05:24:21.878 align:start position:0%
know um we have those numbers and we can
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
uh provide that breakdown I think
 
05:24:27.788 --> 05:24:27.798 align:start position:0%
manufacturing was about even uh from
 
05:24:29.150 --> 05:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
where they were in terms of number of
 
05:24:32.548 --> 05:24:32.558 align:start position:0%
establishments not a not a significant
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
change um is more likely to be on the
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
number per per manufacturer
 
05:24:41.350 --> 05:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
than in actual exitus although that
 
05:24:43.310 --> 05:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
varies to some degree by some Industries
 
05:24:45.788 --> 05:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
some Industries just have harder time
 
05:24:49.948 --> 05:24:49.958 align:start position:0%
competing in our state and tend to be uh
 
05:24:52.510 --> 05:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
find other places in either the country
 
05:24:55.788 --> 05:24:55.798 align:start position:0%
or around the world um where where
 
05:24:58.030 --> 05:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
either likely costs are are
 
05:25:01.628 --> 05:25:01.638 align:start position:0%
significantly more attractive and but it
 
05:25:01.638 --> 05:25:03.150 align:start position:0%
significantly more attractive and but it
varies

05:25:03.150 --> 05:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
varies
 
05:25:06.110 --> 05:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
greatly so and this isn't necessarily
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
the this is a number of deploying units
 
05:25:11.910 --> 05:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
that register with us about the same as
 
05:25:14.590 --> 05:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
where they were first quarter of 2020 in
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing okay um that's macro level
 
05:25:20.030 --> 05:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing there could be some change
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
within the the sub sectors within
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturing thank
 
05:25:28.750 --> 05:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
you okay any other um and um oh go ahead
 
05:25:30.350 --> 05:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
I think we're all set with questions
 
05:25:30.360 --> 05:25:31.030 align:start position:0%
I think we're all set with questions
right

05:25:31.030 --> 05:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:25:34.190 --> 05:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
now um next slide looking at getting
 
05:25:37.190 --> 05:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
into um some of the trends in
 
05:25:40.750 --> 05:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits what we see there
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
um this shows you the trend in new
 
05:25:47.030 --> 05:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
claims activity so uh these are uh
 
05:25:49.390 --> 05:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
people that are newly unemployed that
 
05:25:52.628 --> 05:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
come in to file for unemployment um
 
05:25:55.750 --> 05:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
these are uh the amount of claims the
 
05:25:57.990 --> 05:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
volume of claims is below where we were
 
05:26:00.990 --> 05:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
pre pandemic so still a historically low
 
05:26:04.030 --> 05:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
volume of of of people coming in and
 
05:26:06.990 --> 05:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
filing new claims we'll get into uh what
 
05:26:09.670 --> 05:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
we're seeing on continued CL activity
 
05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
just want to make a point why there's a
 
05:26:12.788 --> 05:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
break in that time
 
05:26:15.948 --> 05:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
series because if we put that that's the
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic and if we actually tried to
 
05:26:21.070 --> 05:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
graph that all of the other lines would
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
have been flat on the bottom we were you
 
05:26:24.320 --> 05:26:25.150 align:start position:0%
have been flat on the bottom we were you
know

05:26:25.150 --> 05:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:26:28.390 --> 05:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
this we we were taking 20,000 claims a
 
05:26:31.470 --> 05:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
week compared to 400 on a weekly basis
 
05:26:33.470 --> 05:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic so it just it
 
05:26:35.350 --> 05:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
would have blown this chart that's why
 
05:26:37.708 --> 05:26:37.718 align:start position:0%
it's absent there another another reason
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
Brian didn't like the pandemic right
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
difficult um looking at the the
 
05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the unemployed so
 
05:26:51.910 --> 05:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
this is slightly different than uh the
 
05:26:54.910 --> 05:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
people filing unemployment claims so
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
taken from the the monthly household
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
survey um which is what is used to then
 
05:27:03.750 --> 05:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
determine uh total labor force and what
 
05:27:06.270 --> 05:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
the state's unemployment rate is but you
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
can see here and how we've br broken out
 
05:27:10.350 --> 05:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
the number of people that are
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
categorized as unemployed um that we we
 
05:27:18.030 --> 05:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
break it into two groups of both good
 
05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
and bad unemployment you know how can
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
there be good unemployment um well there
 
05:27:25.788 --> 05:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
isn't from an unemployment claim
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
perspective but when you look at from a
 
05:27:30.270 --> 05:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
labor force perspective you have
 
05:27:33.230 --> 05:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
individuals represented here in the the
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
blue and the Shaded blue um and then in
 
05:27:38.628 --> 05:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
the yellow uh what we would consider
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
good Unemployment uh where these are
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
people that are um that uh had not been
 
05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
part of the labor force hadn't been
 
05:27:49.030 --> 05:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
looking actively looking for employment
 
05:27:50.510 --> 05:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and they're coming back in because of
 
05:27:52.470 --> 05:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
feeling positive for one reason or
 
05:27:55.270 --> 05:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
another so re-entrance into the labor
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
force um new entrance into the labor
 
05:28:01.070 --> 05:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
force and then in yellow we have our our
 
05:28:03.310 --> 05:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
voluntary job leav so if you're
 
05:28:05.470 --> 05:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
voluntarily leaving unemployment that's
 
05:28:08.230 --> 05:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
not a scenario that's going to uh gain
 
05:28:10.270 --> 05:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh lead to eligibility for unemployment
 
05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
benefits uh but it does indicate a level
 
05:28:15.670 --> 05:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
of confidence and optimism in your
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
situation and in the economic situation
 
05:28:21.310 --> 05:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
um in the labor market situation uh
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
where you're leaving voluntarily to seek
 
05:28:27.070 --> 05:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
better employment um all in all um uh
 
05:28:30.270 --> 05:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
about um
 
05:28:35.150 --> 05:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
50% of of the breakdown from unemploy of
 
05:28:37.788 --> 05:28:37.798 align:start position:0%
the unemployed um from the from the
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
house household survey would be in that
 
05:28:42.350 --> 05:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
good category and then about a quarter
 
05:28:45.628 --> 05:28:45.638 align:start position:0%
of that in the uh dark red here um which
 
05:28:48.628 --> 05:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
are our permanent job uh losers so those
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
are folks that are are laid off and it's
 
05:28:52.788 --> 05:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
not just a temporary laid off that's in
 
05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
our our shaded red uh but the um about
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
25% would be in that uh bad situation of
 
05:29:03.868 --> 05:29:03.878 align:start position:0%
a permanent job loss that hopefully then
 
05:29:05.310 --> 05:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
we're working with in one of the New
 
05:29:08.350 --> 05:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Works office offices to help
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
um I identify opportunities uh within
 
05:29:12.948 --> 05:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
that same sector or identify training
 
05:29:15.830 --> 05:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities to move into a new sector
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh but just looking at those
 
05:29:18.868 --> 05:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
characteristics on both the good and the
 
05:29:21.868 --> 05:29:21.878 align:start position:0%
bad within the um uh portion of the
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
labor force that's uh considered on uh
 
05:29:28.390 --> 05:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:31.390 --> 05:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
category okay thank representative Aly
 
05:29:33.670 --> 05:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
yeah are those numbers
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
individuals uh those are in thousands so
 
05:29:39.868 --> 05:29:39.878 align:start position:0%
in thousands so that's 28,000 there in
 
05:29:43.948 --> 05:29:43.958 align:start position:0%
total sorry representative um on the um
 
05:29:46.948 --> 05:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
within the new entrance re entance and
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
voluntary job levers that's about 13,000
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
so uh just under 50% of that total group
 
05:29:57.868 --> 05:29:57.878 align:start position:0%
and then 7,000 in that dark red which is
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
the the bad unemployment the the
 
05:30:03.470 --> 05:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
permanent job losers which is about
 
05:30:06.548 --> 05:30:06.558 align:start position:0%
25% I I would also note that this was
 
05:30:08.948 --> 05:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
from the third quarter which is the last
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
that we have the the solid data for and
 
05:30:12.590 --> 05:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
the third quarter tends to have a
 
05:30:15.470 --> 05:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
relatively higher number of temporary
 
05:30:18.750 --> 05:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
layoffs because you have schools for for
 
05:30:21.070 --> 05:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
one thing and traditionally that was a
 
05:30:23.708 --> 05:30:23.718 align:start position:0%
time when manufacturing operations would
 
05:30:26.948 --> 05:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
shut down for a short period of time um
 
05:30:29.070 --> 05:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks and if it happened to
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
fall during what is called the reference
 
05:30:33.670 --> 05:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
week when this survey occurs so the
 
05:30:35.708 --> 05:30:35.718 align:start position:0%
third quarter tends to have a relatively
 
05:30:38.270 --> 05:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
higher number of temporary job losers
 
05:30:40.390 --> 05:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
and just to show that uh we don't
 
05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
cherry-pick the data um the quarters
 
05:30:47.350 --> 05:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
prior to this were more um uh uh more in
 
05:30:49.830 --> 05:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
the line of about 2third fitting within
 
05:30:52.030 --> 05:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
that category of good unemployment being
 
05:30:54.150 --> 05:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
your re-entrance new entrance voluntary
 
05:30:56.910 --> 05:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
levers and about a third were in that
 
05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
bad so um as Brian had indicate that
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
that third quarter had a little bit
 
05:31:05.548 --> 05:31:05.558 align:start position:0%
shifted more a little bit towards uh bad
 
05:31:07.910 --> 05:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment but the year overall still
 
05:31:10.590 --> 05:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
still more in the line of about 2/3 in
 
05:31:15.470 --> 05:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:19.310 --> 05:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
category um and and talking before about
 
05:31:22.070 --> 05:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
new claims for unemployment benefits as
 
05:31:24.430 --> 05:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to those that um are
 
05:31:26.548 --> 05:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
identified in the household survey as
 
05:31:28.390 --> 05:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
being in that unemployed group like you
 
05:31:30.628 --> 05:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
saw in the last chart now we're looking
 
05:31:33.470 --> 05:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
back at um unemployment claims so their
 
05:31:36.590 --> 05:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
the weekly claims that individuals file
 
05:31:38.670 --> 05:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
um as they continue to be
 
05:31:41.948 --> 05:31:41.958 align:start position:0%
unemployed um what we're seeing and this
 
05:31:45.030 --> 05:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
is um explains what you'll see with
 
05:31:46.910 --> 05:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
regard to the unemployment compensation
 
05:31:49.868 --> 05:31:49.878 align:start position:0%
trust fund but there has been a gradual
 
05:31:53.110 --> 05:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
increase in duration um over the last
 
05:31:56.150 --> 05:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
few years so here in this slide on the
 
05:31:59.350 --> 05:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
left you can see the average duration at
 
05:32:04.070 --> 05:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning of 2023 about 9.4 weeks
 
05:32:06.310 --> 05:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
now remember folks are eligible for up
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
to 26 weeks they have to be able uh able
 
05:32:11.788 --> 05:32:11.798 align:start position:0%
to work available for work actively
 
05:32:14.110 --> 05:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
seeking work uh but they're eligible for
 
05:32:17.628 --> 05:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
up to 26 weeks um what we've seen is a
 
05:32:20.430 --> 05:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
is a gradual increase in that average
 
05:32:22.750 --> 05:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
duration where the most recent numbers
 
05:32:25.990 --> 05:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
for November put us set just under uh 12
 
05:32:27.948 --> 05:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
weeks average duration so still less
 
05:32:31.230 --> 05:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
than half of what is available to them
 
05:32:34.430 --> 05:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
um but a two and a half week jump um
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
within that time period which um as you
 
05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
would expect that leads to more benefits
 
05:32:42.948 --> 05:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
being paid out of the trust
 
05:32:47.830 --> 05:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
fund um and we you'll we Show a slide um
 
05:32:50.510 --> 05:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
that how that impacts overall trust fund
 
05:32:52.910 --> 05:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
performance and how that then correlates
 
05:32:56.030 --> 05:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
with impacts on New Hampshire businesses
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so even though duration has uh been
 
05:33:02.510 --> 05:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
gradually increasing the last few years
 
05:33:05.070 --> 05:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
that 2 and 1/2 week jump over the last
 
05:33:07.868 --> 05:33:07.878 align:start position:0%
two years um you can see here that
 
05:33:11.590 --> 05:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire still below where we were in
 
05:33:16.510 --> 05:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
2019 so 2019 by all standards uh a
 
05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
strong economy strong labor force
 
05:33:22.190 --> 05:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
performance um low unemployment claim
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
activity in New Hampshire continues to
 
05:33:27.390 --> 05:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
be below the levels experienced in
 
05:33:30.390 --> 05:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
2019 so here New Hampshire just a little
 
05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
over 1% below where we were in 19 when
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
we compare the same weeks back to those
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
same weeks in 19 however New Hampshire
 
05:33:40.948 --> 05:33:40.958 align:start position:0%
is a little bit of an outlier in that
 
05:33:43.590 --> 05:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
regard as you can see here both
 
05:33:46.030 --> 05:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the blue line um the
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
nation as a whole and the black line are
 
05:33:51.708 --> 05:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
both at about double digit percentage
 
05:33:54.110 --> 05:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
increases um in terms of that weekly
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
unemployment claim activity so double
 
05:33:58.788 --> 05:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
digit increases compared to where they
 
05:34:01.750 --> 05:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
were prior to the pandemic uh so that's
 
05:34:05.390 --> 05:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
something we we watch closely um and uh
 
05:34:08.030 --> 05:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
to help put the current claim vol volume
 
05:34:11.350 --> 05:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
in perspective but um so duration up
 
05:34:14.110 --> 05:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
slightly but still overall below where
 
05:34:16.110 --> 05:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
we were prior to the
 
05:34:18.910 --> 05:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic how that then translates into
 
05:34:18.920 --> 05:34:20.070 align:start position:0%
pandemic how that then translates into
um

05:34:20.070 --> 05:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:25.150 --> 05:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
yes could I ask question yes on that's a
 
05:34:25.160 --> 05:34:27.430 align:start position:0%
yes could I ask question yes on that's a
fairly

05:34:27.430 --> 05:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
05:34:27.440 --> 05:34:29.350 align:start position:0%
fairly
standard

05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
standard
 
05:34:34.070 --> 05:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh slow rise but very
 
05:34:37.230 --> 05:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
significant as it goes up uh uh for
 
05:34:39.548 --> 05:34:39.558 align:start position:0%
duration representative for the duration
 
05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
yeah do you think it's got do you have
 
05:34:47.150 --> 05:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
an opinion as to whether it is um a
 
05:34:49.708 --> 05:34:49.718 align:start position:0%
result of people being
 
05:34:53.788 --> 05:34:53.798 align:start position:0%
pickier or are we facing more and more
 
05:34:57.310 --> 05:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
people who just can't get jobs dropping
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
out um it it can it can be that it also
 
05:35:04.670 --> 05:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
um can contribute to the um the pace at
 
05:35:08.270 --> 05:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
which employers are hiring um as well
 
05:35:11.150 --> 05:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
um we work with uh so these individ so
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
this these are individuals that are
 
05:35:14.788 --> 05:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
utilizing the unemployment program so
 
05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
they have required check-ins uh as
 
05:35:19.030 --> 05:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
they're they're coming in and they're
 
05:35:20.990 --> 05:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
working with counselors in their closest
 
05:35:22.910 --> 05:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
office and trying to identify those
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
opportunities but I think it's it's
 
05:35:27.190 --> 05:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit uh both depending
 
05:35:29.910 --> 05:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
on the the situation but it could be a
 
05:35:33.230 --> 05:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh probably more in line with a a a a
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
Slowdown in hiring uh during that period
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
as well compared to the um high level of
 
05:35:41.430 --> 05:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
hiring that we saw uh coming out of the
 
05:35:43.270 --> 05:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic but Brian do you have anything
 
05:35:46.830 --> 05:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
to add to that uh no I think that that
 
05:35:49.910 --> 05:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
rich is pretty accurate on that um there
 
05:35:52.270 --> 05:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
is some element of businesses being a
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more cautious and you know we
 
05:35:57.788 --> 05:35:57.798 align:start position:0%
saw until the last until this summer we
 
05:36:01.948 --> 05:36:01.958 align:start position:0%
were seeing um a very slow decline in
 
05:36:04.350 --> 05:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
the rate of private sector job growth
 
05:36:07.070 --> 05:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
both nationally and in New Hampshire so
 
05:36:08.750 --> 05:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
I do think there was a period of time
 
05:36:10.510 --> 05:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
where certainly businesses in New
 
05:36:12.030 --> 05:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were being more cautious in
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
their hiring and that may have led but I
 
05:36:17.070 --> 05:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
think it's also a result of people
 
05:36:18.868 --> 05:36:18.878 align:start position:0%
feeling as though there are more options
 
05:36:20.750 --> 05:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
they are going to be a little bit more
 
05:36:23.788 --> 05:36:23.798 align:start position:0%
choosy things like looking for remote
 
05:36:26.750 --> 05:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
how many times I I've interviewed
 
05:36:29.390 --> 05:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
candidates and you know they want all
 
05:36:31.868 --> 05:36:31.878 align:start position:0%
remote work opportunities and chose not
 
05:36:33.510 --> 05:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
to work for us so I think people are
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
being a little bit pickier and I think
 
05:36:36.548 --> 05:36:36.558 align:start position:0%
businesses have been a little bit more
 
05:36:36.558 --> 05:36:42.548 align:start position:0%
businesses have been a little bit more
cautious

05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and so on the um employer impact side
 
05:36:47.230 --> 05:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
just from an an unemployment
 
05:36:51.708 --> 05:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
compensation tax perspective um all of
 
05:36:54.030 --> 05:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
those benefits are financed by employers
 
05:36:55.590 --> 05:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
right with their their quarterly tax
 
05:36:57.990 --> 05:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
payments um what employers are
 
05:37:00.350 --> 05:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
experiencing right now are historically
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
low unemployment tax rates so here in
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
this chart you can see on the far right
 
05:37:09.470 --> 05:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
um employers on average areay paying at.
 
05:37:12.548 --> 05:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
61% employers pay that on the first
 
05:37:17.070 --> 05:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
$114,000 in an in annual wages to each
 
05:37:19.910 --> 05:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
employee that translates into about
 
05:37:23.910 --> 05:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
$85 per employee per year a slight
 
05:37:27.628 --> 05:37:27.638 align:start position:0%
increase over the uh prior quarter um
 
05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
that translates into about an $8
 
05:37:33.070 --> 05:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
increase uh for Employers in terms of
 
05:37:36.830 --> 05:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
the change in those rates how this um uh
 
05:37:36.840 --> 05:37:38.110 align:start position:0%
the change in those rates how this um uh
compares

05:37:38.110 --> 05:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
compares
 
05:37:40.910 --> 05:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
regionally and nationally uh New
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers have uh the lowest
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax burden in the uh
 
05:37:50.070 --> 05:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
Northeast uh New Hampshire businesses
 
05:37:53.830 --> 05:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
pay about onethird of the rate that
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts businesses pay to support
 
05:37:59.390 --> 05:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
their unemployment program and then
 
05:38:01.628 --> 05:38:01.638 align:start position:0%
nationally New Hampshire has the third
 
05:38:05.110 --> 05:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
lowest unemployment tax burden uh the
 
05:38:07.628 --> 05:38:07.638 align:start position:0%
two states that have a lower burden are
 
05:38:11.110 --> 05:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
Florida um in Mississippi uh so not
 
05:38:12.830 --> 05:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
states that we are generally uh
 
05:38:15.070 --> 05:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
competing with but in the Northeast New
 
05:38:18.628 --> 05:38:18.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is uh by far and way um the uh
 
05:38:20.910 --> 05:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
has the lowest uh tax burden on
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
employers for their unemployment tax
 
05:38:25.350 --> 05:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
payments not overall with everything but
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
within our wheelhouse and looking at the
 
05:38:30.430 --> 05:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
um their unemployment tax burden and
 
05:38:33.030 --> 05:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's that Revenue that is uh going into
 
05:38:38.628 --> 05:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
our trust fund um one one uh uh change
 
05:38:41.350 --> 05:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
that we are following closely Brian and
 
05:38:43.510 --> 05:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
his team follow extremely closely with
 
05:38:45.910 --> 05:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
their forecasting of the unemployment
 
05:38:49.070 --> 05:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
compensation trust fund is with that uh
 
05:38:52.708 --> 05:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
gradual increase in duration of the
 
05:38:55.468 --> 05:38:55.478 align:start position:0%
length of an unemployment claim going up
 
05:38:57.350 --> 05:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
about two and a half weeks over the last
 
05:38:59.948 --> 05:38:59.958 align:start position:0%
two years um you do see here in this
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
slide that uh annualized benefit
 
05:39:06.868 --> 05:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
payments are now just slightly exceeding
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
annual ized tax payments or the revenue
 
05:39:12.750 --> 05:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
going into the trust fund so what that
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
means for employers um is that the the
 
05:39:19.910 --> 05:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund is largely um absent any sort
 
05:39:24.310 --> 05:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
of um uh economic downturn the the trust
 
05:39:26.868 --> 05:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
fund is largely going to be in a very
 
05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
tight window just below 400 million over
 
05:39:33.670 --> 05:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
these next few years uh we ended 2024 at
 
05:39:37.868 --> 05:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
about 393 million um compared that to
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic uh we are at 300
 
05:39:44.190 --> 05:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
million uh so we are at historically
 
05:39:48.270 --> 05:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
high levels for the trust fund um that
 
05:39:52.910 --> 05:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
is uh largely um um attributed to low
 
05:39:55.788 --> 05:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
claim levels over the last few years
 
05:39:58.110 --> 05:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
increases in the number of employers and
 
05:40:00.350 --> 05:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state that are paying
 
05:40:03.990 --> 05:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
into that fund um but also um the the
 
05:40:08.030 --> 05:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund was a beneficiary of some of
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
the unused uh cares act dollars uh to
 
05:40:13.868 --> 05:40:13.878 align:start position:0%
the tune of about $109
 
05:40:16.590 --> 05:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
million those uh dollars that had been
 
05:40:20.350 --> 05:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
obligated out to an assortment of other
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
programs um were un unused in those
 
05:40:25.350 --> 05:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
programs for whatever reason rather than
 
05:40:27.628 --> 05:40:27.638 align:start position:0%
going back to Washington those dollars
 
05:40:30.468 --> 05:40:30.478 align:start position:0%
uh waterfall into the unemployment fund
 
05:40:33.270 --> 05:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
so now at a historically high level and
 
05:40:34.948 --> 05:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
and more importantly we're at a solvent
 
05:40:37.708 --> 05:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
level as measured uh by the federal
 
05:40:39.868 --> 05:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
government uh when they rate all of the
 
05:40:46.270 --> 05:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
and turn it over to
 
05:40:52.390 --> 05:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
Brian so um one of the things that's
 
05:40:55.070 --> 05:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
occurring is that um we had this chart
 
05:40:58.190 --> 05:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
shows uh the job openings rate in the
 
05:41:00.270 --> 05:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
state and the nation job openings rate
 
05:41:03.548 --> 05:41:03.558 align:start position:0%
is a measure of the number of jobs that
 
05:41:06.030 --> 05:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
businesses say they are looking for
 
05:41:09.468 --> 05:41:09.478 align:start position:0%
workers divided by total employment in
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
the state and what we saw after the
 
05:41:14.510 --> 05:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic because of people leaving the
 
05:41:16.750 --> 05:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
labor force because of a lot of changing
 
05:41:19.030 --> 05:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
of jobs churning people leaving in some
 
05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
Industries for other industry a lot of
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
job openings that stayed High it has
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
been higher in New
 
05:41:27.708 --> 05:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than the nation overall
 
05:41:29.430 --> 05:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
largely because we have more labor
 
05:41:31.708 --> 05:41:31.718 align:start position:0%
constraints but it has been coming down
 
05:41:35.190 --> 05:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
and so we do see that and this is while
 
05:41:37.590 --> 05:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
it looks troubling in some ways is a
 
05:41:38.948 --> 05:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
positive because some of those job
 
05:41:40.590 --> 05:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
openings are simply a reflection of
 
05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
churning in the labor market people
 
05:41:45.910 --> 05:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
going from one employer to another wages
 
05:41:47.910 --> 05:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
were Rising people were jumping from one
 
05:41:50.628 --> 05:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
employer to the other for a a wage
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
increase and that's very costly for
 
05:41:55.390 --> 05:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
businesses um you know the need to train
 
05:41:57.628 --> 05:41:57.638 align:start position:0%
new people Etc so while it looks
 
05:41:59.590 --> 05:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
troubling it's still at a relatively
 
05:42:02.030 --> 05:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
high level and so not especially
 
05:42:04.430 --> 05:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
troubling from my
 
05:42:06.628 --> 05:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
perspective I do have to stop Brian
 
05:42:07.830 --> 05:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
there because
 
05:42:09.430 --> 05:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
That was supposed to be my slide and I
 
05:42:10.750 --> 05:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
looked at them incorrectly so I
 
05:42:13.670 --> 05:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
apologize to Brian for that I can speak
 
05:42:17.708 --> 05:42:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:20.590 --> 05:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
topic um so getting back to how it was
 
05:42:22.990 --> 05:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to go here with our run-of show
 
05:42:26.468 --> 05:42:26.478 align:start position:0%
um looking within the demand uh with the
 
05:42:29.110 --> 05:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
um demand that we've seen uh coming out
 
05:42:32.350 --> 05:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic here it's at the um uh
 
05:42:35.070 --> 05:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
industry level so you can see where the
 
05:42:38.150 --> 05:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
the job posting Act ity has been what
 
05:42:41.070 --> 05:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
type of employers so um largely within
 
05:42:44.190 --> 05:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
the healthc care space um you see the
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
the top uh line numbers here um you've
 
05:42:49.990 --> 05:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
got your traditional type of healthc
 
05:42:52.590 --> 05:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
care employers with Physician Offices
 
05:42:55.788 --> 05:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh with a fair amount of a job
 
05:42:58.468 --> 05:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
posting activity um the next slide will
 
05:43:00.708 --> 05:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
show you where those occupations are
 
05:43:02.670 --> 05:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
that are in highest demand but you also
 
05:43:05.548 --> 05:43:05.558 align:start position:0%
see your staffing agencies here as well
 
05:43:07.468 --> 05:43:07.478 align:start position:0%
so uh the top line number number with
 
05:43:09.150 --> 05:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
your employment placement agencies you
 
05:43:12.190 --> 05:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
also have your temporary Help Services
 
05:43:16.270 --> 05:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
agencies um and there uh been um a
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
strong uh on the demand side with a lot
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
of posting activity a lot of it within
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
the health care space um what we're told
 
05:43:27.110 --> 05:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
from from employers within the healthc
 
05:43:30.510 --> 05:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
care field that uh Reliance upon
 
05:43:33.430 --> 05:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies and traveling nurses
 
05:43:36.070 --> 05:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
which was a lot of how that was being uh
 
05:43:37.548 --> 05:43:37.558 align:start position:0%
the the need for that
 
05:43:39.390 --> 05:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
um that has been going in the other
 
05:43:41.670 --> 05:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
direction from what we're hearing from
 
05:43:45.070 --> 05:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
those employers but this is looking um
 
05:43:47.868 --> 05:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
purely at the posting activity and so
 
05:43:51.070 --> 05:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
what types of um Industries what type or
 
05:43:53.230 --> 05:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
what the employers from each type of
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
Industry that are posting jobs um where
 
05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
do they fall um when we look at it from
 
05:44:02.390 --> 05:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
an occupational perspective you can see
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
registered nurses Head and Shoulders
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
above all of the other types of
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
occupations make sense healthc care is
 
05:44:12.510 --> 05:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
our largest employment sector registered
 
05:44:15.868 --> 05:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
nurses are the largest occupation within
 
05:44:18.910 --> 05:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
that sector and continue to be the most
 
05:44:18.920 --> 05:44:20.070 align:start position:0%
that sector and continue to be the most
sought-after

05:44:20.070 --> 05:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
sought-after
 
05:44:24.110 --> 05:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
position um across um all occupational
 
05:44:27.150 --> 05:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
types and sectors in the state and then
 
05:44:30.230 --> 05:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
we have quite a few other um healthcare
 
05:44:32.990 --> 05:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
related occupations um that are all
 
05:44:35.830 --> 05:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
highlighted here in red one point I
 
05:44:37.708 --> 05:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to make about the register nurses
 
05:44:40.468 --> 05:44:40.478 align:start position:0%
is that we um and it relates to the
 
05:44:43.350 --> 05:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
prior slide um we saw a lot of temporary
 
05:44:45.468 --> 05:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
help agencies at the top of the
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
industries well if you look individually
 
05:44:50.830 --> 05:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
at the job postings you will see that
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
States from across the country are
 
05:44:56.430 --> 05:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
advertising for nurses um in New
 
05:44:59.030 --> 05:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they there is an effort to
 
05:45:01.788 --> 05:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
grab employees not just in that industry
 
05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
but in particular that industry almost
 
05:45:07.548 --> 05:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
40% of those employment a agencies
 
05:45:12.270 --> 05:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
temporary staff um occupations were in
 
05:45:16.230 --> 05:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
healthc care occupations and 15 to 20%
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
are from other states so we're seeing a
 
05:45:22.948 --> 05:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
lot of um competition for labor and that
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
is particularly true in registered
 
05:45:28.270 --> 05:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
nurses how does if I may ask how does
 
05:45:30.110 --> 05:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
the uh how does New Hampshire compare
 
05:45:32.430 --> 05:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
because obviously that competition for
 
05:45:33.990 --> 05:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
or or the number of registered nurses
 
05:45:36.270 --> 05:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
needed is huge how does that compare
 
05:45:38.830 --> 05:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
with other states or the US in general
 
05:45:41.070 --> 05:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
it it it's a problem throughout the
 
05:45:44.350 --> 05:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
country which is why um every state is
 
05:45:46.788 --> 05:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
looking to Rob every other state of its
 
05:45:49.510 --> 05:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
nurses it's why temporary help agencies
 
05:45:52.948 --> 05:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
or employment agencies um are looking
 
05:45:55.788 --> 05:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
for traveling nurses I can't tell you
 
05:45:58.030 --> 05:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
how many I can't well I could how many
 
05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
of those Registered Nursing job postings
 
05:46:04.910 --> 05:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
were from uh America's nurses um and
 
05:46:06.670 --> 05:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
it's just they are looking to recruit
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
nurses nurses and particularly younger
 
05:46:11.310 --> 05:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
nurses who don't have family obligations
 
05:46:13.350 --> 05:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
whatever and they'll travel for a month
 
05:46:15.990 --> 05:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
to one location move to another location
 
05:46:19.110 --> 05:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
so it's a nationwide problem and while
 
05:46:21.468 --> 05:46:21.478 align:start position:0%
it's true in nursing you know the labor
 
05:46:24.468 --> 05:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
market now is being separated from the
 
05:46:26.510 --> 05:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
place of business more and more which
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
means our Engineers are being recruited
 
05:46:32.390 --> 05:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
and can still live in New Hampshire but
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
work somewhere else um you know we see
 
05:46:38.670 --> 05:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
postings from Microsoft we postings from
 
05:46:41.190 --> 05:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh and allows people to continue to live
 
05:46:43.990 --> 05:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and benefit yeah the
 
05:46:45.948 --> 05:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
number of just the sheer number of
 
05:46:49.150 --> 05:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies that are posting um
 
05:46:50.910 --> 05:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
particularly for those healthc care jobs
 
05:46:53.190 --> 05:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
those irn jobs compared to Prior of the
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic that just the number of them
 
05:46:57.948 --> 05:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
exploded um in the in just a few short
 
05:47:00.030 --> 05:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
years well one one of the things I've
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
heard too is that the nurses working for
 
05:47:05.310 --> 05:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies can make so much more
 
05:47:06.430 --> 05:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
they don't want to work for a regular
 
05:47:06.440 --> 05:47:07.708 align:start position:0%
they don't want to work for a regular
employer

05:47:07.708 --> 05:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
employer
 
05:47:10.830 --> 05:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's exacer three times as much
 
05:47:12.868 --> 05:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
the the advertised salaries were almost
 
05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
three times what for a traveling nurse
 
05:47:19.110 --> 05:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
what was advertised for a uh it's coming
 
05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
down a little bit but it's still
 
05:47:25.708 --> 05:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
significantly um greater and and cting
 
05:47:27.990 --> 05:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
those registered nurses pretty
 
05:47:30.468 --> 05:47:30.478 align:start position:0%
aggressively as well making it more
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
difficult for for our um our Healthcare
 
05:47:35.830 --> 05:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
employers that need those positions
 
05:47:37.868 --> 05:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
within the state I know this isn't in
 
05:47:39.430 --> 05:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
your area but do you have any idea what
 
05:47:41.350 --> 05:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
the university system is trying to
 
05:47:43.670 --> 05:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
increase their nursing
 
05:47:47.910 --> 05:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
program the well um I I know there have
 
05:47:50.670 --> 05:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
been uh you know it's it's not a problem
 
05:47:53.150 --> 05:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's been overlooked at all uh by the
 
05:47:54.670 --> 05:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
both the community college system and
 
05:47:56.788 --> 05:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
the university system and trying to
 
05:47:59.990 --> 05:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
create more programs so that they can uh
 
05:48:02.350 --> 05:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
attract more uh students and produce
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
more registered nurses um I know one
 
05:48:07.390 --> 05:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
problem they continue to have is just
 
05:48:09.628 --> 05:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
um getting enough uh individuals that
 
05:48:12.430 --> 05:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
are qualified to be instructors in those
 
05:48:15.230 --> 05:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
programs um and and attracting them away
 
05:48:17.750 --> 05:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
from industry or um doubling down on
 
05:48:19.070 --> 05:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
what they're already doing and and
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do courses after the their
 
05:48:23.868 --> 05:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
regular shifts but what we've heard is
 
05:48:26.030 --> 05:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
difficulty in getting those instructors
 
05:48:29.708 --> 05:48:29.718 align:start position:0%
to lead more and more of those programs
 
05:48:31.990 --> 05:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
another issue is the fact that we lose
 
05:48:32.000 --> 05:48:32.910 align:start position:0%
another issue is the fact that we lose
about

05:48:32.910 --> 05:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:48:36.510 --> 05:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
1,00 nurses commute out of state every
 
05:48:36.520 --> 05:48:37.830 align:start position:0%
1,00 nurses commute out of state every
day

05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:48:41.070 --> 05:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
um and largely to Massachusetts um U you
 
05:48:43.190 --> 05:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
know the the Boston metro area is a
 
05:48:46.990 --> 05:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
major medical um region um offers
 
05:48:48.910 --> 05:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
significantly higher wages not so much
 
05:48:51.910 --> 05:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
at entry level wage earners but as
 
05:48:54.030 --> 05:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
nurses get more experience the wage
 
05:48:57.670 --> 05:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
differentials become 30 $40,000 based on
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
our analysis of wage data um so we do
 
05:49:03.230 --> 05:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
lose a lot there's only one region in
 
05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
our state that attracts more nurses from
 
05:49:07.628 --> 05:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
another state and that's Grafton County
 
05:49:11.070 --> 05:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
because of Dartmouth Mary hitch
 
05:49:13.070 --> 05:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
guot thank
 
05:49:14.868 --> 05:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
you to
 
05:49:16.708 --> 05:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
you all
 
05:49:19.548 --> 05:49:19.558 align:start position:0%
right okay so let's look at some of the
 
05:49:21.750 --> 05:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
challenges um one of the challenges we
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
face and that's uh a labor force the
 
05:49:27.670 --> 05:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
size of our labor force this shows um
 
05:49:30.270 --> 05:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the red line again
 
05:49:32.910 --> 05:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
always in the red line um it indicates
 
05:49:35.230 --> 05:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
that we are have a labor force that is a
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
bit smaller than it was prior to the
 
05:49:39.788 --> 05:49:39.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic um I have a little bit of
 
05:49:42.190 --> 05:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
skepticism of some of those numbers um
 
05:49:43.868 --> 05:49:43.878 align:start position:0%
and it would appear to be inconsistent
 
05:49:47.310 --> 05:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
with the job growth well it's not that
 
05:49:49.270 --> 05:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
inconsistent when you think about H
 
05:49:51.430 --> 05:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
what's happening around some of our
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
neighboring states one of the ways we
 
05:49:56.110 --> 05:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
are able to grow our employment without
 
05:49:57.910 --> 05:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
growing and I don't think this is a good
 
05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
thing necessarily we're able to grow our
 
05:50:02.830 --> 05:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
employment without growing our labor
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
force concomitantly is that we've been
 
05:50:08.150 --> 05:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
attracting people to work in New
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who live in other states the
 
05:50:12.270 --> 05:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
re the economies around us are not as
 
05:50:13.628 --> 05:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
strong they're not adding as many
 
05:50:16.548 --> 05:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
workers on a percentage basis those
 
05:50:18.868 --> 05:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
people if they live in Maine or they
 
05:50:20.708 --> 05:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
live in Vermont or even if they live in
 
05:50:22.468 --> 05:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they work in New
 
05:50:24.670 --> 05:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're counted in the labor
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
force of those States so we don't get
 
05:50:29.750 --> 05:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
the benefit of them counted in our labor
 
05:50:31.750 --> 05:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
force but we may get the benefit of
 
05:50:34.510 --> 05:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
their employment so that's one way we
 
05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
can kind of make that inconsistent
 
05:50:40.548 --> 05:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
inconsistency more
 
05:50:44.230 --> 05:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
consistent um looking at um what I like
 
05:50:47.390 --> 05:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
is what my favorite measure of um the
 
05:50:49.350 --> 05:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
tightness of the labor force I'm not a
 
05:50:51.468 --> 05:50:51.478 align:start position:0%
huge fan of the unemployment rate for a
 
05:50:53.430 --> 05:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
number of reasons one of which is
 
05:50:55.948 --> 05:50:55.958 align:start position:0%
unemployment is made up of so many
 
05:50:58.868 --> 05:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
things Deputy mentioned all of the
 
05:51:00.910 --> 05:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
different characteristics of the
 
05:51:02.830 --> 05:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
unemployed it's not just people who lose
 
05:51:04.868 --> 05:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
their jobs so it can be a little bit
 
05:51:06.868 --> 05:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
misleading the number can rise if you
 
05:51:08.990 --> 05:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
get a bunch of new people re-entering
 
05:51:10.510 --> 05:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
the labor force or entering the labor
 
05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
force this is my preferred measure it's
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
the employment to population ratio
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
people ages 25 to 54 participate in the
 
05:51:20.590 --> 05:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
labor force at the highest rates of all
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
age groups 90% or so are in the labor
 
05:51:29.830 --> 05:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
force when 85% of those in New Hampshire
 
05:51:31.788 --> 05:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
have a job are
 
05:51:34.750 --> 05:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
employed that I consider based on
 
05:51:37.708 --> 05:51:37.718 align:start position:0%
historical data to be at full employment
 
05:51:40.750 --> 05:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
so anytime we're above that we're really
 
05:51:44.070 --> 05:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
in a very very tight labor market those
 
05:51:46.708 --> 05:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
characteristics those times early end of
 
05:51:49.788 --> 05:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
the 90s early
 
05:51:53.390 --> 05:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
2000 contrast that with the Great
 
05:51:56.948 --> 05:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
Recession we had excess labor for five
 
05:51:59.310 --> 05:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
years it took us five years to get a
 
05:52:01.310 --> 05:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
little bit beyond that actually to gain
 
05:52:03.708 --> 05:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
back all the jobs we lost in the Great
 
05:52:06.708 --> 05:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
Recession so labor shortages prior PRI
 
05:52:09.070 --> 05:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic again pretty severe
 
05:52:14.990 --> 05:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
labor shortages we were at 87% 88% um in
 
05:52:17.548 --> 05:52:17.558 align:start position:0%
terms of employment to population ratio
 
05:52:19.948 --> 05:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
it took us a while from the pandemic to
 
05:52:22.510 --> 05:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
get back to that level but again we're
 
05:52:24.990 --> 05:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
above the 85% level I will say the US
 
05:52:27.070 --> 05:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
it's around 80% we have different
 
05:52:30.670 --> 05:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
demographics but 85% so we're labor
 
05:52:33.310 --> 05:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
constrained by this particular measure
 
05:52:35.948 --> 05:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
and can have an impact on our ability
 
05:52:35.958 --> 05:52:37.110 align:start position:0%
and can have an impact on our ability
again

05:52:37.110 --> 05:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:52:40.430 --> 05:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
to grow our labor force but if we are
 
05:52:43.510 --> 05:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
attracting from other states then that
 
05:52:46.468 --> 05:52:46.478 align:start position:0%
allows us to some degree to overcome it
 
05:52:48.070 --> 05:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
now I'll get into some of the things
 
05:52:50.510 --> 05:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
that uh Professor Johnson mentioned this
 
05:52:53.070 --> 05:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit different look looking at
 
05:52:55.150 --> 05:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
the three Northern New England
 
05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
states how does population grow I didn't
 
05:53:00.270 --> 05:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
hear his entire presentation but they
 
05:53:02.350 --> 05:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
grow natural population growth more
 
05:53:04.510 --> 05:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
people being born than dying net
 
05:53:06.670 --> 05:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
domestic migration more people moving
 
05:53:08.750 --> 05:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
into your state than moving out and more
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
people moving internationally in than
 
05:53:13.628 --> 05:53:13.638 align:start position:0%
are moving out this shows and I
 
05:53:15.430 --> 05:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
apologize because it doesn't reflect the
 
05:53:17.868 --> 05:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
fact that New Hampshire has had greater
 
05:53:20.788 --> 05:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
population growth than than Maine but it
 
05:53:22.750 --> 05:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
does reflect the individual numbers of
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
those three categories and there's two
 
05:53:27.868 --> 05:53:27.878 align:start position:0%
things there's things that I really
 
05:53:30.468 --> 05:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight one of which is the
 
05:53:31.788 --> 05:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
net domestic
 
05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
migration Maine has done significantly
 
05:53:36.708 --> 05:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
had significantly more domestic
 
05:53:39.948 --> 05:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
migration then has New Hampshire is that
 
05:53:41.548 --> 05:53:41.558 align:start position:0%
you know when I think about that I think
 
05:53:43.990 --> 05:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
well Maine has about the same population
 
05:53:46.910 --> 05:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
size population as New Hampshire it does
 
05:53:49.468 --> 05:53:49.478 align:start position:0%
not have nearly as strong an economy and
 
05:53:52.590 --> 05:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have nearly as vibrant
 
05:53:56.270 --> 05:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
economy so to me that points to one
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
particular issue and that has housing
 
05:54:00.468 --> 05:54:00.478 align:start position:0%
and their ability to accommodate housing
 
05:54:02.468 --> 05:54:02.478 align:start position:0%
I'll talk a little bit more about that
 
05:54:05.590 --> 05:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
but um a couple of other things New
 
05:54:07.990 --> 05:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has um relied a lot on
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
international migration and I will say
 
05:54:12.830 --> 05:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
that the characteristics of our
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
International migrants tend to be very
 
05:54:16.548 --> 05:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
different than a lot of States we tend
 
05:54:19.468 --> 05:54:19.478 align:start position:0%
to attract a number of Highly skilled
 
05:54:22.510 --> 05:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
well-educated um International migrants
 
05:54:25.070 --> 05:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
employed in some of our largest and most
 
05:54:28.430 --> 05:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
important organizations um we also have
 
05:54:30.868 --> 05:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
lower skilled and less well educated
 
05:54:33.948 --> 05:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
migrants but on balance um our benefit
 
05:54:36.150 --> 05:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
from international migration largely is
 
05:54:39.910 --> 05:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
up Skilling our labor force Maine um not
 
05:54:42.030 --> 05:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
as much Vermont is struggling for a lot
 
05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
of reasons more people have been moving
 
05:54:45.510 --> 05:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
out of that state except for a couple of
 
05:54:47.670 --> 05:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
years during the pandemic um they have a
 
05:54:50.788 --> 05:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
lot more labor challeng or demographic
 
05:54:52.670 --> 05:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
challenges this is just a chart that
 
05:54:55.590 --> 05:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
shows the net domestic migration over
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years um we did have a
 
05:55:00.190 --> 05:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
period where we saw more people moving
 
05:55:04.190 --> 05:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
out very consistent with that employment
 
05:55:05.468 --> 05:55:05.478 align:start position:0%
growth that I showed you in the
 
05:55:08.110 --> 05:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
population uh employment to population
 
05:55:10.590 --> 05:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
ratio we had a hard time recovering our
 
05:55:13.590 --> 05:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
jobs during that time period in addition
 
05:55:15.190 --> 05:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
people who are moving into our state
 
05:55:18.150 --> 05:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
tended to be as I characterize them two
 
05:55:20.310 --> 05:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
wag ear or married couple families
 
05:55:22.190 --> 05:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
likely both college educated with
 
05:55:25.270 --> 05:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
children during the Great Recession they
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
probably owned a house somewhere else
 
05:55:28.708 --> 05:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
very likely they were underwater based
 
05:55:30.590 --> 05:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
on what happened to housing values they
 
05:55:31.948 --> 05:55:31.958 align:start position:0%
would have wanted to sell that house to
 
05:55:33.990 --> 05:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
move to New Hampshire and they would
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
have wanted to buy a house in that was
 
05:55:38.830 --> 05:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
difficult with credit conditions so that
 
05:55:41.390 --> 05:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
contrib we bounced back some but we you
 
05:55:43.310 --> 05:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
know we had a great increase during the
 
05:55:46.270 --> 05:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic as did all Northern New England
 
05:55:49.548 --> 05:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
states saw a benefit during that time
 
05:55:52.150 --> 05:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
period as people look to uh Escape more
 
05:55:55.468 --> 05:55:55.478 align:start position:0%
densely populated areas um Professor
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
Johnson mentioned some of the rural
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
school school districts well if you
 
05:56:01.070 --> 05:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
looked and I did look at things like
 
05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
searches for houses in different
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
counties some of the biggest increases
 
05:56:09.788 --> 05:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
were in places like Carol County Grafton
 
05:56:12.868 --> 05:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
County saw a huge increase and it was a
 
05:56:14.270 --> 05:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
result of the pandemic and people
 
05:56:17.070 --> 05:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
looking for for more open space and less
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
um congestion net international
 
05:56:23.070 --> 05:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
migration has been very strong you see
 
05:56:27.230 --> 05:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
near the end n 2019 to 2020 well that
 
05:56:30.030 --> 05:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
was a pandemic you know very difficult
 
05:56:33.548 --> 05:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
to move anywhere you couldn't fly you
 
05:56:34.910 --> 05:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
know you could it was difficult to
 
05:56:38.190 --> 05:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
travel so that that but if you kind of
 
05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
even that out as Rich likes to say point
 
05:56:43.390 --> 05:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
that out and smooth it it's pretty
 
05:56:46.030 --> 05:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
consistent um with the prior years prior
 
05:56:48.350 --> 05:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic but still important
 
05:56:53.468 --> 05:56:53.478 align:start position:0%
source of of um our employment and labor
 
05:56:55.430 --> 05:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
force growth and that's shown in this
 
05:56:58.628 --> 05:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
chart um immigrants in New Hampshire
 
05:57:00.990 --> 05:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
have a higher labor force participation
 
05:57:05.948 --> 05:57:05.958 align:start position:0%
rate um than native born uh population
 
05:57:08.868 --> 05:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
and and a higher employment rate um
 
05:57:11.230 --> 05:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
overall and again a lot of this has to
 
05:57:13.708 --> 05:57:13.718 align:start position:0%
do with the fact that our international
 
05:57:16.390 --> 05:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
migration tends to be higher skilled
 
05:57:17.750 --> 05:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
they tend to have higher levels of
 
05:57:19.468 --> 05:57:19.478 align:start position:0%
educational attainment I have some
 
05:57:21.270 --> 05:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
slides on that that I didn't include
 
05:57:23.750 --> 05:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
here um a lot of people with graduate
 
05:57:26.990 --> 05:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
degrees a lot of college educated um
 
05:57:29.190 --> 05:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
individuals where are they employed and
 
05:57:33.430 --> 05:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
this is important um looking at Key
 
05:57:35.190 --> 05:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
Industries manufacturing being one of
 
05:57:37.190 --> 05:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
them professional Tech technical science
 
05:57:39.390 --> 05:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
Technical Services so they're employed
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
in a lot of Industries but manufacturing
 
05:57:43.350 --> 05:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
and professional scientific and
 
05:57:45.030 --> 05:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
Technical Services employ an awful lot
 
05:57:48.948 --> 05:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
of um uh foreign born workers and I
 
05:57:51.070 --> 05:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
highlighted construction there because
 
05:57:53.708 --> 05:57:53.718 align:start position:0%
I'm very skeptical of this number um I'm
 
05:57:55.390 --> 05:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
skeptical because that particular
 
05:57:57.430 --> 05:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
industry tends to employ if you're
 
05:58:00.430 --> 05:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
looking for undocumented immigrants and
 
05:58:02.628 --> 05:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
undocumented migration you'll see a lot
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
of that in the construction industry so
 
05:58:07.948 --> 05:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
this is based on um Census Bureau survey
 
05:58:10.468 --> 05:58:10.478 align:start position:0%
and undocumented um individuals
 
05:58:12.670 --> 05:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
generally don't respond to government
 
05:58:12.680 --> 05:58:14.990 align:start position:0%
generally don't respond to government
surveys

05:58:14.990 --> 05:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
so almost done um but I mentioned the um
 
05:58:20.868 --> 05:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
difference between Maine and New
 
05:58:23.548 --> 05:58:23.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in terms of migration domestic
 
05:58:26.270 --> 05:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
migration and I think this plays a role
 
05:58:29.270 --> 05:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
looking at new housing units authorized
 
05:58:31.910 --> 05:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
by building permit this is um annualized
 
05:58:35.230 --> 05:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
so it's a 12-month rolling sum you see
 
05:58:38.230 --> 05:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know a little about 10 years ago you
 
05:58:41.110 --> 05:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
started to see a real Divergence in
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
terms of the number of homes that were
 
05:58:46.750 --> 05:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
permitted in main versus New Hampshire
 
05:58:49.708 --> 05:58:49.718 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that has U basically
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
Maine has accommodated more growth um
 
05:58:54.990 --> 05:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
and has to to be honest with you saw
 
05:58:57.310 --> 05:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
that they also had you know a net
 
05:59:00.670 --> 05:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
negative natural population growth uh uh
 
05:59:03.070 --> 05:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
of 25,000 or more where New Hampshire's
 
05:59:04.868 --> 05:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
was a little more modest Although our is
 
05:59:07.510 --> 05:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
going to increase um so they have to
 
05:59:09.548 --> 05:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
accommodate uh we will have to
 
05:59:11.270 --> 05:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
accommodate movement into the state if
 
05:59:13.468 --> 05:59:13.478 align:start position:0%
we want our population and ultimately
 
05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:19.350 --> 05:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
grow um just shows net state-to-state
 
05:59:22.468 --> 05:59:22.478 align:start position:0%
migration I I didn't update it to 2024
 
05:59:25.868 --> 05:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
but as a percentage of 2020
 
05:59:29.310 --> 05:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
population um you know this three-year
 
05:59:31.230 --> 05:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
time period New Hampshire all of the
 
05:59:33.628 --> 05:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
Northern New England states and did very
 
05:59:36.150 --> 05:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
well Maine did especially well people
 
05:59:40.350 --> 05:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
moving to that state um and again during
 
05:59:43.708 --> 05:59:43.718 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and post pandemic we saw uh
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
people looking to exit from more densely
 
05:59:49.830 --> 05:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
populated areas Northern New England
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
neighboring very densely populated
 
05:59:54.070 --> 05:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
regions in the Northeast we were the
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of that even Vermont which
 
05:59:58.510 --> 05:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
for 10 years prior had seen out
 
06:00:01.510 --> 06:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
migration net out migration um just
 
06:00:02.990 --> 06:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
you'll hear about this tomorrow so I
 
06:00:04.708 --> 06:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
won't spend time the number of houses
 
06:00:09.510 --> 06:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
for sale is down you know um
 
06:00:13.390 --> 06:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
dramatically um from pre-pandemic
 
06:00:16.030 --> 06:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
levels the housing vacancy rate
 
06:00:17.910 --> 06:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
according to the New Hampshire Housing
 
06:00:21.628 --> 06:00:21.638 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority is well below what you
 
06:00:24.110 --> 06:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
would expect or what you would like to
 
06:00:28.270 --> 06:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
see around 5% it varies by by reasons um
 
06:00:31.590 --> 06:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
and by communities but still very low
 
06:00:33.548 --> 06:00:33.558 align:start position:0%
again if we're going to rely on people
 
06:00:35.670 --> 06:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
moving into the state we have to be able
 
06:00:37.708 --> 06:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
to accommodate them and that is the way
 
06:00:39.350 --> 06:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
we are going to grow we have the among
 
06:00:40.948 --> 06:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
the lowest birth rates although I will
 
06:00:43.030 --> 06:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
say the most recent year we saw an
 
06:00:45.430 --> 06:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
increase in our in our birth rates we're
 
06:00:47.510 --> 06:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
no we were no longer number one or two
 
06:00:50.590 --> 06:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
lowest birth rates we I think dropped to
 
06:00:53.190 --> 06:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
number five or six
 
06:00:56.708 --> 06:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
lowest um lastly or next to lastly um
 
06:00:59.190 --> 06:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
our forecast and I'm you know went back
 
06:01:02.230 --> 06:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
and looked at what I said last year or
 
06:01:04.230 --> 06:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
yeah or yeah was last year or two years
 
06:01:05.910 --> 06:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
ago last year two years ago whatever
 
06:01:08.150 --> 06:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
ever I've consistently under forecast a
 
06:01:11.110 --> 06:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
little bit um this year um I'm not going
 
06:01:15.510 --> 06:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
to make that mistake again um I hope um
 
06:01:17.468 --> 06:01:17.478 align:start position:0%
but I will say I did never forecast a
 
06:01:19.110 --> 06:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
recession so I was one of the few people
 
06:01:20.110 --> 06:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
who didn't think we were going to have a
 
06:01:22.750 --> 06:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
recession in 2023 but this is different
 
06:01:24.830 --> 06:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
in that I do expect um that New
 
06:01:28.750 --> 06:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will see modestly improved
 
06:01:31.948 --> 06:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
um uh job job growth compared to the US
 
06:01:34.110 --> 06:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
and that's a trend from a change from
 
06:01:36.468 --> 06:01:36.478 align:start position:0%
the last few years
 
06:01:38.468 --> 06:01:38.478 align:start position:0%
lastly and this is where you know
 
06:01:41.948 --> 06:01:41.958 align:start position:0%
politically um looking at um you know
 
06:01:44.150 --> 06:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
dodging bullets this is not a political
 
06:01:45.390 --> 06:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
statement but these are some of the
 
06:01:47.430 --> 06:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
threats looking from Strictly an
 
06:01:50.628 --> 06:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
economic perspective um higher tariffs
 
06:01:53.910 --> 06:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
run the risk of raising inflation uh
 
06:01:57.390 --> 06:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
increasing prices um and one of the
 
06:01:58.868 --> 06:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
problems with tariffs that doesn't get
 
06:02:01.230 --> 06:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned very often um yes it does
 
06:02:04.670 --> 06:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
raise um imported goods prices relative
 
06:02:07.548 --> 06:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
to products services that are
 
06:02:10.590 --> 06:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
produced internally in in our country
 
06:02:13.590 --> 06:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
but it is also a license for us
 
06:02:15.468 --> 06:02:15.478 align:start position:0%
producers to raise their prices and I
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
tell you that does happen so they are
 
06:02:20.190 --> 06:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
they are given more freedom to raise
 
06:02:22.270 --> 06:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
their prices so overall price levels do
 
06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
Rise um reducing immigration could
 
06:02:28.030 --> 06:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
tighten already limited labor Supply um
 
06:02:28.040 --> 06:02:28.868 align:start position:0%
tighten already limited labor Supply um
and

06:02:28.868 --> 06:02:28.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:31.990 --> 06:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
reinflation could rekindle and I we're
 
06:02:34.150 --> 06:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
already seeing interest rates not
 
06:02:35.990 --> 06:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
dropping and the FED is saying saying
 
06:02:38.110 --> 06:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
that it might not drop rates as much or
 
06:02:40.510 --> 06:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
as fast as it thought it would um and
 
06:02:42.110 --> 06:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
the rest of these things I the only
 
06:02:44.270 --> 06:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
thing I I would not note is oil price
 
06:02:47.070 --> 06:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
spikes which you know for 50 years every
 
06:02:49.310 --> 06:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
recession had an oil price spike
 
06:02:51.788 --> 06:02:51.798 align:start position:0%
component to it um we have weathered
 
06:02:53.830 --> 06:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
some pretty difficult things in the in
 
06:02:56.548 --> 06:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
the market for in the oil Market um
 
06:02:58.750 --> 06:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
largely because we have we're producing
 
06:03:00.548 --> 06:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
more now than we ever did in this
 
06:03:03.868 --> 06:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
country and we're actually exporting um
 
06:03:07.310 --> 06:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're we're exporting or o um so I think
 
06:03:09.390 --> 06:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
we can handle some International crisis
 
06:03:11.948 --> 06:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
not dramatically but we can handle that
 
06:03:13.868 --> 06:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
a little bit better so with that we'll
 
06:03:16.708 --> 06:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
stop and take questions and I'll just
 
06:03:20.468 --> 06:03:20.478 align:start position:0%
point out there is a lot that um made uh
 
06:03:22.788 --> 06:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
got cut on the editing floor here from
 
06:03:24.948 --> 06:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
the presentation so if there are are
 
06:03:26.190 --> 06:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
topics that are addressed here that
 
06:03:27.390 --> 06:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
people would like to see further
 
06:03:30.910 --> 06:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
explored uh we can do that please ask um
 
06:03:32.190 --> 06:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
and if there are other topics that
 
06:03:33.830 --> 06:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get addressed if there is data
 
06:03:35.788 --> 06:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
that we have we'd be more than happy to
 
06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
provide it so please ask on that as
 
06:03:42.468 --> 06:03:42.478 align:start position:0%
well great thank you uh Senator
 
06:03:52.468 --> 06:03:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:52.478 --> 06:03:55.990 align:start position:0%
 
question

06:03:55.990 --> 06:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:58.868 --> 06:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
14es of
 
06:04:01.750 --> 06:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
25 notjoin the
 
06:04:01.760 --> 06:04:03.750 align:start position:0%
25 notjoin the
workforce

06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
06:04:09.070 --> 06:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
post and question what is that number
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
and second part is what percentage of
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:21.548 --> 06:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:24.430 --> 06:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
regained um so what we can do Senator is
 
06:04:26.510 --> 06:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
we can uh provide an
 
06:04:29.350 --> 06:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
updated uh slide I believe what you what
 
06:04:32.430 --> 06:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
we showed before was uh participation
 
06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
broken down it was a pre- pandemic
 
06:04:36.868 --> 06:04:36.878 align:start position:0%
versus where we were that point
