00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
um before you and I don't know if
 
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
they've been handed out yet but I assume
 
00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 align:start position:0%
the 608 is before you
 
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I uh put in there that
 
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
the department should select two but no
 
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
more than three area agencies to undergo
 
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
a pilot of what they intend to roll out
 
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
on the first of July so so go ahead and
 
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
take a subset of the community and and
 
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
and try to implement what they're in
 
00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
they want to implement on a small scale
 
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
before they roll it out it's essentially
 
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
you know the look before you leap model
 
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
it's uh as a carpenter say you know
 
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
measure twice cut once so it it's just a
 
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 align:start position:0%
validation effort this is not me saying
 
00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 align:start position:0%
that I don't support
 
00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
to really know what I think it's going
 
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
to be but but I have been enough in the
 
00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
community to listen and the area
 
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
agencies I think you're going to have a
 
00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
number of them talking and number of the
 
00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
community talking I think they're
 
00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
generally in favor of it because they
 
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
don't uh to summarize what I think
 
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear they don't think
 
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
that there's enough information that
 
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's enough systems roll out for that
 
00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
like the I.T systems and stuff for them
 
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
to really be able to effectively do
 
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
what's going to be expected of them I I
 
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
put into the legislation a very loose
 
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
disruption of a pilot project and what a
 
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholder is
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
um because I believe that the the
 
00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 align:start position:0%
professionals at the Department of
 
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services can certainly
 
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
know how to do a pilot project and put
 
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
it together so I I wanted to tell them
 
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
what they needed to do do a pilot
 
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
Project without telling them exactly how
 
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
to do it because I I think they can
 
00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
figure that out
 
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
um the checkpoint in that is that
 
00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of transparency
 
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
about these uh meetings that are to be
 
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
held with the stakeholders and they're
 
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
to be videoed and and shared
 
00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
um so that there's transparency in the
 
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
in the process some transparency that I
 
00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 align:start position:0%
think many might think doesn't uh exist
 
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
in the in the BDS redesign efforts but
 
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's for the committee to hear the the
 
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll hear that
 
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
um the this a m report uh admits that a
 
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
lot of the data that they might need to
 
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
do a better plan is just missing it
 
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
didn't exist and so a bunch of
 
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
assumptions were made when you start to
 
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
do something that can affect as many
 
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
clients as this would you you really
 
00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 align:start position:0%
ought to have that data and the pilot
 
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
project would get that
 
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
what I was surprised most by all of this
 
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
was the Deep cynicism about the that it
 
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
has emerged from the DD Community I you
 
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
some of you may know I was on HHS you
 
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
know three terms ago and I've been sort
 
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
of involved and I I've heard about you
 
00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
know last year I helped fund stuff in
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
the DD community and and what this bill
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
has done is it's opened the door where a
 
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
number of people have called me and let
 
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
me know of their deep seething cynicism
 
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 align:start position:0%
about how the money is Flowing from
 
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
government to take care of the clients
 
00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
and and and I think you're going to also
 
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
hear some testimony that uh you know we
 
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do a pilot project we should
 
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
just burn the whole thing down and start
 
00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
over so so what I I highlight that for
 
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
you now so that I want you to remember
 
00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 align:start position:0%
that what this bill is about doing a
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
pilot project regardless of the context
 
00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
and scenarios and the history and all of
 
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
that this is just a very simple before
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
we roll out the whole thing let's do a
 
00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
pilot project so I would ask you when
 
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
you're listening to the testimony you
 
00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 align:start position:0%
you you you you keep that stuff
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
segregated in your mind stay focused on
 
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
the pilot project you're going to hear
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we may possibly lose hundreds of
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars from the feds if if
 
00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
we don't just roll this out completely
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
on one July I think that's a little bit
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
of a smoke screen a little bit
 
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.530 align:start position:0%
of a smoke screen a little bit
fear-mongering

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering
 
00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 align:start position:0%
I I I CMS has already approved several
 
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
waivers for delays and I I just got to
 
00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
believe that if we in good faith work
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
with them and say we want to implement
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
your program but we're going to do a
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
pilot project to make sure we do it
 
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
right and we don't hurt people when we
 
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
when we roll this system out I think I
 
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 align:start position:0%
think we would we would get that waiver
 
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
so so you're going to hear about the
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
money but I'm also going to ask you to
 
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that there is a finance
 
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
committee if you pass it there's a
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
finance committee that's supposed to be
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
worrying about the money and what you
 
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
all ought to be looking at is I
 
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
understand the tradition is the policy
 
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
and and I'm here asking you a policy
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
decision should we do a pilot project
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
before we roll out this great of a
 
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
change and I I think the answer is yes
 
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill is rational I think
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
every Professional Organization out
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
there conducts pilot projects I think
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's the it's what you know professional
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
project managers recommend and and it's
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
it happens to be what I'm recommending
 
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
as well so with that I'll take questions
 
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
if there are any okay yes representative
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I understand
 
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
the concept of of the pilot but just
 
00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
from my own edification two quick
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
questions if you could maybe kind of
 
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
walk us through the history what's
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
driving the redesign itself and second
 
00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 align:start position:0%
is the pilot looking
 
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
um at
 
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.510 align:start position:0%
um at
um

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
what the redesign is going to look like
 
00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
or is it going to investigate does uh
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
the redesign go ahead at all or or both
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
so what's what's kind of the scope of
 
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
the pilot uh the first question I'm
 
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 align:start position:0%
going to give you an admittedly
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
partial answer there are other people
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
here who know the history of the
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
redesign efforts and what's motivated
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
far better than I do but I but I think
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of the stirrings started
 
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
around 2017 you know CMS wanted to come
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
up with a a better way to get services
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
to clients uh you know I believe that
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
the direct Bill part of it was to
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
basically bypass middlemen so that the
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
money went you know more directly to
 
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
service providers and in support of the
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
clients I I believe that's a lot of the
 
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 align:start position:0%
motivation and the timeline of when it
 
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
got started in New Hampshire we we spent
 
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
a pretty intense four-year period I
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
understand getting ready to roll
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
something out and we we stopped all of
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
those efforts when the Alvarez and
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
Marcel report came out and apparently
 
00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:07.819 align:start position:0%
we've taken a new New Direction
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
completely New Direction and and again
 
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's why the pilot project is there
 
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
now to your other point about what is
 
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this pilot project
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
i i i presuppose that this is a
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a good program I I I
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
fundamentally understand that we have to
 
00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 align:start position:0%
do something in order to make sure we're
 
00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
in compliance with federal law and if we
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
if we don't get around to doing it uh
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative then we do put at risk
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
the money it's not that there's never a
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
risk it's just that I don't think in the
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
short term we're at risk of losing the
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
money as long as we're you know
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
communicating to CMS and I wrote If I
 
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
Had 608 in front of me I would go
 
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
exactly to the section in there it's a
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
small bill but there's a section in
 
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
there of some of the questions that I
 
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
would expect a pilot to answer and uh
 
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
and I think there are some more
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions that could be asked but that's
 
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
you know that's for the in-depth project
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
planning that I think should happen
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
generally what's good about this rollout
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
what's bad about this rollout how do we
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
how do we do do the the good stuff and
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
with it and fix the bad before we roll
 
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
it out to every area agency
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:32.389 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant thank you Mr
chair

00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Edwards
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
why a pilot
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
program versus a study committee or a
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
study Commission because the study
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee is still just dealing with
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
Theory and uh and uh in the report that
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
the uh that was developed and I think
 
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
it's going to be referenced here in a
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
bit that specifically says that this
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
study was done without adequate amounts
 
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
of data and that many assumptions were
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
made along the way and so a study
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
committee is going to deal with the same
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
uncertainty they're they're going to not
 
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
have the experience that a pilot project
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
is going to do this is this is the power
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
of a pilot project is is as you get past
 
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
the theory you get into what's really
 
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
happening during an implementation and
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
and and and and you get you get a level
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
of uh understanding and comprehension of
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
what the implications are for the entire
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
system by doing a little bit you know
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
you try before you buy kind of the study
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee is just more people sitting
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
around talking Theory I think thank you
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Nagle
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
my question I I received an email this
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
morning about this and I I'm just
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
ask a question for you it says that
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
um uh where are you we're under a
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
corrective action thing that that um
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
expires on July 1st
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
um if we don't do this what happens and
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
if we do do this does this Advance us
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
towards being in compliance with CMS
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
I I think there's a discussion to be had
 
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
with CMS and what we're doing to address
 
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan I think we've
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
been under that correction action plan
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
for years and we've kicked the can down
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
the road a few times uh and so uh rather
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
than kicking the can down the road
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
saying someday we're going to do
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
something this is fundamentally
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
different this is we're committed to
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
doing this but before we do this we're
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to do a pilot project just to make
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
sure we do it right and that we don't
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
hurt clients in the way now it may be
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
that we find that area agencies have
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
sort of outlived their usefulness and
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
some of them have to go away to get
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and economies of scale and
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
there might be some consolidation or
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
some other reforms that are that we
 
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:04.019 align:start position:0%
discover I'm not here to protect the
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
area agencies I'm I'm here thinking that
 
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we have people who need
 
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
these services and we're all should be
 
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
focused on the common mission what it's
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
going to take to meet the needs of the
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
the developmentally disabled
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
um and that I went beyond the answer to
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
your question I I think it's it's a I
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
think it's a valid concern and I think
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
if if you all decide on the policy
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
by the time it gets over to division
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
three I know some of the people on
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
division three I I I know that will
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
bring in the the the really smart people
 
00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:44.459 align:start position:0%
to bring us testimony on precisely where
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
we are with the money we're not gonna
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
We're not gonna throw away 182 million
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal money that'd be
 
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.730 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal money that'd be
insane

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
insane
 
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.870 align:start position:0%
insane
so

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
um yeah thank you representative Edwards
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
um in your experience I mean because
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
there are time constraints on this
 
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
um have we run similar Pilots like this
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
in the past and have they been able to
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
be executed within some of the time
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
Scopes that you see in this bill
 
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
you know that's an excellent question
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
representative McLean I I I I think I
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
might be able to come up with an example
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
of when we should have done a pilot
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
project and because we didn't we screwed
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
it up pretty badly
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's in the in some of
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid reforms that we did we
 
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
broke things that we didn't want to
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
break there'll be some more testimony on
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
that but specifically to give you an
 
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
example of when the state has conducted
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
a pilot project I can't think of any I I
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
can tell you in my experience uh with
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
the Department of Defense telemedicine
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
test bed we we always did a pilot
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
project you know before we rolled out
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
filmless Radiology systems and hospitals
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
instead of sending it to everyone we
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
looked at three hospitals to get three
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
different perspectives on what it takes
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
to implement the system and to train the
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
people and worry about the culture and
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
get the except acceptance and so so I've
 
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
had experience outside of the State of
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in other government
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
situations where pilot projects were
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
critical to the long-term success
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative I
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
have two questions the first is must all
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
other efforts be suspended or only those
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
that would be implementing the full
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
program as of July 1st
 
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
or is that something to look into so
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
so I'll apologize if the wording around
 
00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
that is a little clumsy but I can tell
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
you what my intent is and and maybe you
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
could help help me clean that up my my
 
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
intent was for the two or three area
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
agencies that are the subjects of the
 
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
pilot that to the maximum extent
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
possible they should be implementing the
 
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
the program that it that we want to have
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
at the end of this process it's been
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
envisioned by the department for a long
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
time okay and that the other area
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
agencies uh are held in advance and they
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
continue to operate in the status quo
 
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
until we get the pilot project results
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we know how to start sending the
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
others into the woods with what we now
 
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.870 align:start position:0%
others into the woods with what we now
know

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
that's very very helpful in my follow-up
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
sure follow up thank you my second
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
question is that data is required in
 
00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
Section 5 on March 1st that's only eight
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
months after the pilot program begins
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
and the pilot program is supposed to go
 
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
10 months are you looking for interim
 
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
data so that there can be information
 
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
about whether this is looking good or
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
complete data
 
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.850 align:start position:0%
complete data
I'm

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.790 align:start position:0%
I'm
um

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to plan according to
 
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:18.620 align:start position:0%
the time available
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
and this is one of those times where I
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
have heard the concern that CMS
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
wants us implementing the corrective
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
actions plan and they're expecting it on
 
00:15:31.449 --> 00:15:31.459 align:start position:0%
one July
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
the eight months is me guessing how much
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
a reasonable amount of time might be to
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
negotiate with CMS for them to say okay
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
we we could we can forestall enforcement
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit longer you know
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
they're because there will be area
 
00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
agencies uh in the pilot project and
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
because the department will be there
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
they're going to be learning constantly
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
right so every day is an another day of
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
school and uh and and they have this
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
sisney organization uh that uh this the
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
the Lessons Learned will will be rolling
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
out informally as as they go and and as
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
a result of that sort of informal
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
information flow I think we can just
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the the final report
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
will be basically writing itself as
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
people learn what works and what doesn't
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
does that does that address your
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
question it does help we can dig into
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
this more later but I think that
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
absolutely helps thank you
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that I've run a
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
number of pilot programs myself
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so I understand the value of it uh
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
is it going to be a document for this
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
pilot it has the scope of what what it
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
intends to do as well as
 
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
what's the success criteria what what's
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
the ultimate goal so that we as as we
 
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
move forward we we know what the intent
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
of this pilot is
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
let me let me go back to what I said in
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
my earlier testimony that that what I
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
put in here is loose with the
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
expectations that the professionals at
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
the department working with the area
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
agencies will come up with the the more
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
comprehensive I'm telling them what they
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
need to do they need to do a pilot
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
project I'm not telling them how to do
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
it you're you're absolutely right that
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
they they need a scope document they
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
need to know what the success criteria
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
are you know rather than serve as the
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
project manager for this
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
I have just sort of cut it off where I
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
think there's a handoff point to say
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
okay now that we all know we should
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
there shall be a project plan go go do
 
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.650 align:start position:0%
there shall be a project plan go go do
one

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yeah representative
 
00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:08.990 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yeah representative
Weber

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
question uh you stated that this would
 
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539 align:start position:0%
be going to the smart people on division
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
three but I don't see this I didn't say
 
00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:21.380 align:start position:0%
smart people I I never said that
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
I just I know someone but I will not
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
require the tape to be rewound
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
what I am concerned about is that this
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
bill is not on the early Bill list and
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
therefore I don't think it's going to
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
finance at all can you confirm or deny
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a fiscal in it it does
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
or it may but it's not on the early Bill
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
list so it's it's not on the second
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
committee list and not all FN bills are
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
first committed
 
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
I mean that that shouldn't that
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a hard fix
 
00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
to have it referred to uh Well Finance
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
could I have particularly when the when
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
there are people you know saying oh no
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose 182 million dollars
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
I I I think it's rational to try to get
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
it over to the finance committee
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative my concern is
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
that we have a deadline tomorrow for
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
this committee to act
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
if it is a second committee bill that is
 
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:24.500 align:start position:0%
the deadline
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
so I would like some kind of assurance
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that the chairman would
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
want some kind of assurance about what
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
is happening that with this bill and by
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
when it needs to happen because I don't
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
believe it's been flagged as a bill that
 
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
needs to be acted on by tomorrow nor
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
would I be particularly comfortable
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
acting on something this major by
 
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
acting on something this major by
tomorrow

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure it's been noticed
 
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
either in previous testimony I've I've
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
admitted that you've been training me
 
00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
for five years on uh house rules and the
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
protocols and the data flows and so I'm
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
highly deferential to your observation I
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what to do about that I
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's you know a call to
 
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office to say hey we need
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
we need an exception here
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I don't know how that
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
works I I do think that I'm here asking
 
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419 align:start position:0%
you about the policy primarily and not
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
about the money
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel oh I'm sorry other
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:36.539 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none okay thank you all right
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak this morning is
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
Chris Antonello from the Department of
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
and again if you can hold it to around
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's okay great thank you good morning
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
I'm Chris santanello associate
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the Department of Health
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to oppose um how spell
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
608 is introduced the legislation seeks
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
to Pilot changes to the BDS system and
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
indefinitely suspend any other BDS
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
redesign efforts which would take us
 
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
back several steps and years from the
 
00:21:27.169 --> 00:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
progress already underway to improve the
 
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
efficient delivery of services to this
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population I recognize that
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
change is hard for everybody the current
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
bill appears to speak to redesign
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
efforts but also on line 15 or 16 15 to
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
16 include any additional changes to the
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
current system
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
the department is currently working on
 
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
changes to the system on two different
 
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
categories of changes required Federal
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
changes and the system redesign based on
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
the 2020 Alvarez and Marcel report I
 
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
will in my three minutes um speak of
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
those separately as part of the required
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
renewal of the 1915 C waiver which funds
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
developmental Services is required every
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
five years we have been under a
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan with CMS since
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
2017 under conflict of interest and
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
direct Bill conflict of interest has
 
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:24.860 align:start position:0%
been a requirement of CMS since 2014.
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
working with CMS we have been able to
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
extend the deadline for compliance until
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2023 pushing it out further
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
puts the waiver those we serve Federal
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
matching dollars and the department at
 
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.909 align:start position:0%
matching dollars and the department at
risk

00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the legislature debated New
 
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's compliance with 42 CFR
 
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.169 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's compliance with 42 CFR
section

00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:50.179 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
441-301 and determined that area
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
agencies authorized agencies and other
 
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:57.419 align:start position:0%
organizations under contract to provide
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
services shall be in compliance with
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
this federal law
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chose the lowest bar for
 
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
compliance with conflict of interest we
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
chose it at the individual level not the
 
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
agency level this makes it much harder
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
for the Department inter enforce but it
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
gives agencies flexibility and increased
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
choice for individuals and Families
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
direct bill for developmental Services
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
System is necessary for the system to
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
come into compliance with Federal
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rules it aligns with every
 
00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:34.580 align:start position:0%
other service program in the department
 
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
developmental service providers are an
 
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
anomaly with current billing practices
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is not the norm a provider must
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
enroll in Medicaid
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
but a trading partner can bill for the
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
agency so far only one area agency has
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
agreed to do this this would ease the
 
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.230 align:start position:0%
agreed to do this this would ease the
transition

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
these changes while critical are
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
necessary and they are not required as
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
part of the recommendations of Alvarez
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
and Marcel
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
the recommendations which are the 1915 C
 
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:09.980 align:start position:0%
tiered waiver tiered reimbursement rates
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
establishing a comprehensive I.T system
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
and developing an in-state Network for
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
increased supports for individuals with
 
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.100 align:start position:0%

intensive support needs in the spring of
2020

00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:21.539 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
sorry we are happy to Pilot any of the a
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
m recommendations and we have clearly
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
communicated that we will pilot the a m
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
recommendations thank you thank you
 
00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:35.690 align:start position:0%
recommendations thank you thank you
questions

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
is it possible in your opinion with the
 
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:48.049 align:start position:0%
is it possible in your opinion with the
agency

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
to do an interim report back to the
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
oversight committee over at DHHS in
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
other words as you get into this program
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
to provide a
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
report on how the program is doing so if
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
we need to make any changes we're not
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
getting deep into the process at that
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
point in time we could take corrective
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
actions if we need to but is it possible
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
to do that yes absolutely
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative representative Weber
 
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
um can you or is there anybody in your
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
department who could help us draft
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
around the two different pieces here
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
so that we could continue with the
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
implementation of those things which
 
00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:39.419 align:start position:0%
must be implemented under the corrective
 
00:25:39.419 --> 00:25:41.710 align:start position:0%
must be implemented under the corrective
actions

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
actions
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
by July 1st while allowing the rest of
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
the changes that are the departmental
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
changes to be piloted in the way
 
00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
contemplated by this
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
Bill yes absolutely
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
okay representative Leon could I have a
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
follow-up I'm sorry uh
 
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
if we needed to do it by tomorrow well
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
we can't do it by tomorrow because
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's no way to notice a hearing an
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
exec on this uh but can that be done
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly I guess is my
 
00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:17.090 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly I guess is my
question

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't mean to cut you off I'm
 
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
trying to um yes absolutely it's a good
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
thing John Williams is not in here right
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
now because
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
um but yes working together with John
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
Williams and Melissa Nemet the attorney
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
for um this part of the department we
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
can we could
 
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:36.020 align:start position:0%
by the end of the week provide something
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
good representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
and being so um flexible here my
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
question is if this can be also drafted
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
with a five-month interim data point
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
with the criteria of success so that we
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
know if it's looking good or if it's
 
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
looking like there needs to be some
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
change in action while getting the full
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%

also signed up to speak is Rebecca

thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
today on favor of House Bill 608 my name
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
is Rebecca Bryant and I'm the president
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
and CEO at Lakes Region Community
 
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:48.419 align:start position:0%
Services where the area agency for
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
Region 3 centered out of Laconia and I'm
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
also the president of Community Support
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
Network Incorporated representing the 10
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
area agencies
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
in the process of the systems work
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
imposed on us over the last two years we
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
have been repeatedly told by our
 
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
Regulators as you heard today that
 
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
change is hard they know change is hard
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
they tell us that on every single call
 
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
the level of difficulty or the amount of
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
effort required has never been a
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
question or concern for myself my
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
colleagues or the dedicated albeit
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
inadequate Workforce in our agencies in
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
supporting the most vulnerable citizens
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
in our communities we do hard things
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
every day 24 7 365.
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
what we are asking for is change done
 
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
right prior to joining the Human
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
Services world my career was in
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
corporate finance and in manufacturing
 
00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:36.539 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're familiar with the
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
Japanese term kaizan which means change
 
00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
for the better Kaizen requires all
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
elements of a process Upstream
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
Downstream on a plane or in a cube to be
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
identified and considered when imposing
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
change or continuous Improvement
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
ensuring that all elements are connected
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
another key component of kaizan is the
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
implementation of the scientific method
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
creating a hypothesis testing it
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
correcting it until you get it right
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
when Toyota would come to us to
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
introduce a change or component of
 
00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:06.299 align:start position:0%
continuous Improvement it would be
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
thoroughly tested in a gated area
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
separate from the rest of the
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process until it was a
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
hundred percent correct and the system's
 
00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:15.419 align:start position:0%
changes we're being asked to implement
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
we do not yet have all of the components
 
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
identified sourced priced or tested
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
we're asking that we gate off a corner
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
in our system that we can safely
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
Implement which a tremendous amount of
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
hypothetical information test it correct
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
it where necessary and get it right in
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
manufacturing if we didn't get it right
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
we were always aware that it was not
 
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
just the possibility of the failure of
 
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
an automotive component but actual harm
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
Downstream to those operating in
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
automobile in human services there is no
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
room for Downstream the people we
 
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
support are directly impacted by
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
everything we do we are looking for this
 
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
bill amongst other ways to slow down and
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
test and do this work correctly the
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
bureau and the department have asked for
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
extensions in other areas just recently
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to us there's another
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
extension asked for another CMS
 
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
requirement for evv electronic visit
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
verification other states have
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
successfully continued to demonstrate
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
that we are in good faith moving forward
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
but get delays so 7123 did not have to
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
be the end-all be-all to Jeopardy's
 
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
jeopardize our Medicaid dollars an
 
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
extension is absolutely something that
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
should have been on the table until we
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
got this right I can tell you speaking
 
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
for myself and my agency and my board we
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
are not against change I personally and
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
this is completely a personal statement
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
believe that our current system is not
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
sustainable we need rates we need change
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
but we need change done right thank you
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions
 
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
oh representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here and
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question what are your
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the proposition to the
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
department to
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
um just suspend the non-a M parts of
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
this and pilot the other parts
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
um I think it's really complicated
 
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
because honestly I don't think you can
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
separate the a m from the conflict of
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
interest and and the corrective action
 
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
plan so corrective action plan covers
 
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and direct Bill and
 
00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299 align:start position:0%
a m covers a whole bunch of other stuff
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
and over the last four years all of that
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
has intersected so it is very much an
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
intertwined conversation right now and
 
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
again you know I you heard
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
um Ms santanello refer to the fact that
 
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
only one Area Agency signed up to be a
 
00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
trading partner we don't have the
 
00:31:42.409 --> 00:31:42.419 align:start position:0%
information technology currently to be
 
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
trading partners so a trading partner
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
for direct bill is not even a
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
possibility and that's not just because
 
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
we're sitting back going oh we don't
 
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
have a system and we're not going to
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
change we have a legacy system that in
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
Partnership many years with the Bureau
 
00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire leads was the billing
 
00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:00.299 align:start position:0%
system for 9 out of 10 area agencies we
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Legacy systems and a
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
humongous amount of I.T overhaul that
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
needs to happen and by the way we have
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have funding for that
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so so you know there's a
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
lot there's so many detailed components
 
00:32:15.169 --> 00:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
of this obviously um but that that's
 
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
just one example where I just don't
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
believe we can talk about a m and the
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
corrective action separately at this
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
point they're very intertwined
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
right before you get a copy of your
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
testimony ma'am too and before we're
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also thank you
 
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
this is a field I'm not really burst in
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
so please pardon my ignorance here
 
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire the first state to go
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
down this road or are we following a lot
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
about the states that we could learn
 
00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
from and therefore we don't need to do a
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
pilot because the other State's already
 
00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say all at different levels
 
00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
every state is having to obviously
 
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
comply with the center for Medicaid and
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
Medicare services so is that
 
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.789 align:start position:0%
Medicare services so is that
follow-up

00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
partially what I'm asking for is if
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
other states have done this successfully
 
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
instead of having a pilot can we look to
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
those States as the pilot to learn from
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
them and therefore we don't have to back
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
up we can continue forward knowing that
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
we could reach out to a fellow State and
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
learn from them to help us versus going
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
down a road by ourselves to create a
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
separate pilot great question so no we
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
can't look in another state because
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
there's no one other state that's done
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
it the same when you're when you're
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
working with CMS on your waivers you
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to look at how you
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
do things in your state and get it
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
approved by CMS there's many states and
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
process that are not complete most of
 
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
the other states that have been working
 
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
on this had already still had
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
institutions New Hampshire as you know
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
closed our institution a long time ago
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
our system looks very different we
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
actually specifically asked Myers and
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
stuffer and forgive me I always get it
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
wrong m s who is working under a m on
 
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
this project for the rate setting piece
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
of it we actually recently asked them on
 
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
a call if they could look at another
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
state and tell us another state that had
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
done this successfully and the m s
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
consultant actually on that call said to
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
us no there's no other state that has
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
done so much at one time as New
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is trying to do
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
foreign other questions yes
 
00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
my question and you may not be the right
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
person to ask this but I'm going to ask
 
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:31.580 align:start position:0%
it anyway
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
this is a little naivety also but a m is
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
Alvarez and Marshall Marcel Marcellus
 
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
um it would be really helpful to
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
understand for me the road map of this
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
entire system
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
um not just your your your agency which
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
I actually believe in not work with but
 
00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.310 align:start position:0%
I actually believe in not work with but
um

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the entire roadmap of what's being
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
affected the number of people being
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
involved is there any way to get that
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
kind of information for us
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
um and I should have asked this of the
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
previous person probably yeah I mean I
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
think that a road map could very
 
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
successfully be created in partnership
 
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
with both BDS and and area agency and
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
put that road map together I did
 
00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:11.099 align:start position:0%
previously submit to the committee um
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
testimony a letter that I wrote that
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
walks you through the timeline I would
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
highly encourage you to read that
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
document because it does have the entire
 
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
timeline I also submitted two hard
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
copies this morning but I submitted soft
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
copies prior thank you
 
00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:30.650 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
German I'm sorry
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
oh okay sorry I thought you were
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
pointing to someone over there
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:42.980 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
I I come from a
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
very long history of trying to
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
understand the DD system and I think
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon who's standing
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
over there has had years of experience
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
of and I can't ask you if why it always
 
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
has to be so complicated because I I
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
know that's an inappropriate question
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
but for me it has been a very long
 
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.630 align:start position:0%
but for me it has been a very long
journey

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
journey
 
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
I am
 
00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
totally confused by the Department's
 
00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:23.180 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
if if it's not going to finance I don't
 
00:36:28.849 --> 00:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
know why they would have such a
 
00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
know why they would have such a
frightening

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
frightening
 
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
a statement that in the absolute worst
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
case scenario the loss you have a
 
00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:38.420 align:start position:0%
question representatively yeah
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
I think the question is why is this
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
always so complicated but I know you
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
but that it does seem to indicate a very
 
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
serious implication for the future of
 
00:36:59.050 --> 00:36:59.060 align:start position:0%
your program
 
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
can you get anything out of all that
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
companies I would love to be able to
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
explain why anything related to
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
government is so complicated I I
 
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
I I did spend my my life started in
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
public accounting and corporate finance
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
I came to my agency as a CFO and I've
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
said this many times and I've said it
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
before in other hearings I truly was one
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
of those wet behind the ears Finance
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
people that thought I was going to come
 
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
into this system find efficiencies such
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
as a m and others have tried I have
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
never found such tight budgets such lean
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
margins and such hard-working people and
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
we work for the families in New
 
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my board is made up of 50 of
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
consumer representation I work for the
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
families in New Hampshire I don't work
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
for you know I'm not working for
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
corporate America for a reason so all I
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that when it touches
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
families it gets complicated and it
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
should and it has always been a
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
partnership between the bureau
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
developmental Services I've been here
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
for 17 years the first 10 as a CFO we
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
had tremendous partnership with the
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
bureau we sat at the table together we
 
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
were not blindsided by reports such of
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
this we were not finding out when things
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
were being delivered and ordered we were
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
at the table creating the solutions so
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
why is it complicated today that's why
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
it feels complicated to me today and I
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
know a lot of people will say we're
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
trying to preserve the area agency
 
00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:18.020 align:start position:0%
system we're trying to preserve our jobs
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
I'm an incredibly transparent blunt
 
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
person you can take me and and decide
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
for yourself you don't know me but I can
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
tell you right now I can walk out of
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
here today and I can get a job back in
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
Corporate America doing whatever I want
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
to do I have the skills I have the
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
experience what I don't have is the
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
passion for anything but what we're
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
doing here when you have worked for the
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
families of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
our most vulnerable citizens that is who
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
we are working for I'm not preserving
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
Becky Bryant's job I'm preserving the
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
quality of life for the individuals in
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
the Greater Lakes Region
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
anyone else any other questions
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Karen
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I believe it is from the
 
00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
disability rights leadership
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
good morning my penmanship must be
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
terrible it's the disability rights
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
Center New Hampshire thank you this is
 
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
Karen I'm Karen Rosenberg and I'm the
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
policy director for disability rights
 
00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
Center in Hampshire
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
um the state's protection and advocacy
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
Organization for people with
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
disabilities we regularly hear from
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
folks across the state who benefit from
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
HCBS Services these are the services
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
that area agencies are currently helping
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
to deliver and which allow people with
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
disabilities to live in their
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
communities instead of Institutions and
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
we are very concerned about this bill
 
00:39:44.339 --> 00:39:46.010 align:start position:0%
we are very concerned about this bill
and

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and are adamantly opposed to it now I
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
mean pilot programs can make sense in a
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
lot of Industries and maybe even in
 
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:57.740 align:start position:0%
government programs but unfortunately
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
this program is funded in large part by
 
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:05.300 align:start position:0%
CMS with Medicaid funds and there are
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations that the state must
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
follow in order to secure the those
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
funds there are processes that CMS has
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
in place to waive some of those
 
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
requirements and in fact the CM the
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
waivers that we're talking about those
 
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
Home and community-based Services
 
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
waivers are called that because
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
CMS has allowed the state to secure
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
Federal Medicaid matching funds to
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
operate these waivers with waiving some
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
of the requirements that would generally
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
be there for state plan services so for
 
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
example if it's a state plan service
 
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's a service that generally has to
 
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
be available to all people throughout
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state but a waiver but the HCBS
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
waiver programs are programs where the
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
state has secured cms's permission to
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
only make these particular services
 
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
available to certain individuals
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
and they can limit the number of
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
individuals even so
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
um but but the state doesn't get to go
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
Rogue they have to get cms's approval
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
for any waivers in order to secure that
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
essential matching fund that we need to
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
be able to make sure that people get
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
those HCBS Services there's another
 
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
mechanism CMS makes available to States
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's called an 1115 demonstration
 
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
waiver that's another mechanism that
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
states can use to try to get permission
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
for some limited amount of time to test
 
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:38.099 align:start position:0%
a theory that would allow where they
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
would get permission to waive certain
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid requirements thus our
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
that has actually secured one of those
 
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
waivers at least one there's maybe more
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
but that's what's allowing the state
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
right now to fund inpatient substance
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
misuse treatment also something that's
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
not generally funded by Medicaid but
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
this is you know if you were to pass a
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
pilot program I was thinking about this
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
for this particular program I've heard a
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
lot about putting the cart before the
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
horse this is like putting the cart
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
before the Trojan Horse and we're Troy
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
because if we we've known for since at
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
least well 2014 that conflict-free case
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
management was required we've been on a
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan since 2017
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
um that's requiring the state to comply
 
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:26.099 align:start position:0%
with this Federal Medicaid regulation to
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
qualify for their money that we need to
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
have conflict-free case management and
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
direct billing and these are things that
 
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
actually benefit people with
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities direct billing allows
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities to have broader
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
access to the services that they require
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
the level that they require
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
if you could start oh I'm sorry
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
I've got a lot to say I'm but anyway I
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
again I encourage you to oppose this I'm
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you might
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions for this lady
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:07.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
so if we do not pass this bill
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
what do you foresee happening between
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
now and July
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
that you think is positive and more
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
positive than what would happen if we
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
were to pass the bill the state needs to
 
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
come into compliance with the direct
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
billing and conflict-free case
 
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
management by July I mean that's what's
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
required and you know it's I'm not the
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
one who has to implement that so I think
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
everyone needs to really dig their heels
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
in and do it and that will be positive
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
for everyone
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:51.500 align:start position:0%
and and just a follow-up follow-up
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
and do you read as somebody said that
 
00:43:55.619 --> 00:43:56.569 align:start position:0%
and do you read as somebody said that
this

00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
bill is going to Halt compliance with
 
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
that piece of the puzzle well I'm
 
00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
concerned that that's what it intends to
 
00:44:07.619 --> 00:44:08.809 align:start position:0%
concerned that that's what it intends to
do

00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
um this is not the kind of thing that
 
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
can be piloted we've already gotten our
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
prime directive from CMS that we must
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish this
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
so I am concerned that we would put
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
federal dollars at risk and that would
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
translate into reduction in services for
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
people who really need them
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
see no other questions okay thank you
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
we have uh two folks signed up from one
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
sky uh if I'm reading the name what's
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
right uh Jason Archibald and Matthew
 
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.730 align:start position:0%
right uh Jason Archibald and Matthew
cadero

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
cadero
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
do folks want to testify individually or
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay uh all right Mr Archibald
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you all very much for
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
taking the time to hear I submitted
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning via email I ask
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
that you take the time to read it I am a
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm the type of person that um if it's
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
not written and I can't point to it it
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
so throughout my testimony I reference
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
what the bureau has actually said and
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
what the bureau has actually done
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
um so this morning just the cap uh just
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
to begin our system supports 7 500
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
people to the tune to about 400 million
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
the last three years I've been part of
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
the system we've actually underspent our
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
budget by 30 to 40 million dollars we
 
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
are extremely efficient
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
um that money could go back into the
 
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
system and increasing rates it could go
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
back into increasing housing but the
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
bureau has chosen to give that money
 
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
back to increase the a m work
 
00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:05.099 align:start position:0%
how we got here is in 2017 we received a
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
corrective action as a state that we
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
needed to have direct bill and we needed
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
to have uh conflict-free case management
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
the state worked with the area agency
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
system for four years to accomplish this
 
00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
the area agency systems including mine
 
00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:19.450 align:start position:0%
the area agency systems including mine
divested

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:19.460 align:start position:0%
divested
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
businesses bought new accounting systems
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
bought new
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
um uh made other Investments including
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
like physical capacity to buildings
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
spent millions of dollars to come into
 
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.730 align:start position:0%
spent millions of dollars to come into
compliance

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.349 align:start position:0%
compliance
around

00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
um September of 2020 sometime that month
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
a m was hired through a sole source
 
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.770 align:start position:0%
a m was hired through a sole source
contract

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
also in that month BDS
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
um sent a request to CMS to extend the
 
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
deadline for coffin-free case management
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
and direct Bill to July 1st coming up
 
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.930 align:start position:0%
and direct Bill to July 1st coming up
and

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:54.890 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
they also began the a m work a m turned
 
00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:01.700 align:start position:0%
around and submitted their a m report
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to read some quotes from
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
that that I think will put things in
 
00:47:07.089 --> 00:47:07.099 align:start position:0%
perspective for you
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
and that was sent to us in March that's
 
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
when we found out about the report the
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
report was based off of only the
 
00:47:14.819 --> 00:47:16.270 align:start position:0%
report was based off of only the
bureau's

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
bureau's
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
priorities as it states in the report
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
and the data that they were given and in
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
the report in several areas it literally
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
says that the report was incomplete and
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
the report was the the data was uh um
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
corrupt or erroneous in areas
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
and they call that out the purpose of
 
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
the a m report
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
um in certain areas is just one quote
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
was to constrain access and cost
 
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.750 align:start position:0%
was to constrain access and cost
um

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
so a m recommends BDS introduced tiered
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
waiverid structures in which the funding
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
caps are placed at specific levels to
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
constrain service authorization and
 
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.910 align:start position:0%
constrain service authorization and
access

00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:02.099 align:start position:0%
this is kind of the the reasons that we
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
have issues with the a m work and when
 
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
you look at the a m work itself it
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
didn't involve any stakeholders
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
that they're an aside why we're here
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
today and why we're asking for it to be
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
piloted is because we're not ready for
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
July 1st we don't have the billing
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
systems put into place we don't even
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
have the regulations and if they were
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
sent out to us today we wouldn't get
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
them till May which means we'd have two
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
months to turn businesses around uh to
 
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
come into compliance
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend millions of dollars
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
on poor project management and our area
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
agencies our nonprofits and our families
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
can't afford that people will more than
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
likely not get paid and Sarah says will
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
not be provided which are going to leave
 
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
a large segment of our population
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
without services
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
these are the issues
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
one of my biggest concerns is the
 
00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:56.780 align:start position:0%
hyperbole around the CMS
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
cap in the fact that we're going to
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
potentially lose Federal match dollars
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
and I will read this part because I
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time researching it
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
um suggesting if you could start
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
wrapping up please okay
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
um suggesting the state may lose our
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
federal match dollars due to our
 
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
legislative body listening to its
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
constituency constituents is hyperbolic
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
No statement of this kind has been
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
publicly made by CMS nor has it ever
 
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:21.380 align:start position:0%
acted so unilaterally to quash
 
00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
sovereignty of a state and its people in
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
periods of non-compliance CMS has
 
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
historically shown it works with State
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
administrators to bring them in
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
compliance in a realistic way they
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
actually have
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
hundreds of documents on their website
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
that talk about you should work with
 
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
legislators because unfortunately
 
00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
foreseen things happen and I provided a
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
link in the end of my testimony to that
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
documentation they work with us they
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
have no want will a desire to destroy
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
our system they only have a desire to
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
make it better and that's what the
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan is for we as area
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
agencies want the same thing
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure we do it in a
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
way that doesn't harm anyone and if we
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
try to force this through come July 1st
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
just because we're we're trying to meet
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
a deadline that we haven't even talked
 
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
to CMS about extending we're going to
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
harm someone and when we look back at
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
this moment because we're all watching
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
if it's not done right July 1st
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's going to be consequences and
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
those consequences aren't going to be
 
00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
for the people here in this room who are
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
not family members and not individuals
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be family members and
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
individuals who are going to feel those
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
consequences so thank you very much and
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
if uh representative Martian I would
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
like to address your question about
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
piloting if you don't mind
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
um there's been several times where I've
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
submitted I've worked in other states I
 
00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
have a um a history my work history is
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
about a little less than 20 years I've
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
had the privilege to work around the
 
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.290 align:start position:0%
had the privilege to work around the
country

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.010 align:start position:0%
country
um

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
the foster care system in Florida has a
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
setup similar to ours it's very
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
successful I've sent it to the bureau
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
I've sent it to a m
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
um there's many times where I sit on the
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
the rate committee meeting it's very
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
scripted we don't have the ability to
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
really say much more than what they want
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
us to talk about
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
um that is something that we should look
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
at as a model
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
but we still need to Pilot this because
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
if we don't
 
00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:20.339 align:start position:0%
I truly believe we're going to lose a
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
lot of New Hampshire providers and we're
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
going to send people into out-of-state
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
placements because we have no we don't
 
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
have the capacity for them now thank you
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
another question yeah representative
 
00:51:29.819 --> 00:51:30.950 align:start position:0%
another question yeah representative
King

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
King
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald and thank
 
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
you for testifying today I really
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate I really liked your testimony
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's concerned about missing out
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
on federal dollars
 
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
um and so we have to change our system
 
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
to meet what the federal what the feds
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
want for us if it weren't for the money
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
do you think it would still be a good
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
change to do or are we simply bending
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
over backwards for federal dollars here
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
like is it is it really an improvement
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
or are we just doing it for the money
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
my honest and personal opinion is a
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
combination of both they have some
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
really great ideas in the a m report and
 
00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:12.980 align:start position:0%
then they have some really terrible ones
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
in my opinion from working around the
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
country in a lot of different systems so
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
if they had the one thing about our
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
system was we have people here that
 
00:52:24.119 --> 00:52:24.770 align:start position:0%
system was we have people here that
um

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
I felt like I've I've been in awe of how
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
much they actually know and in this
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
whole redesign process their voices
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
weren't heard and I've talked I've heard
 
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.589 align:start position:0%
weren't heard and I've talked I've heard
unprecedented

00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
unprecedented
 
00:52:36.599 --> 00:52:37.190 align:start position:0%
unprecedented
um

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
you know stakeholder participation and
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
transparency I've had to send myself to
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
foyer requests I've had to threaten to
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
send foyer requests during the meetings
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
if you watch my testimony on any of the
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
rate setting meetings you're going to
 
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
find that I don't follow the game plan I
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
ask questions and the responses I get
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
most of the time is that's really good
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll consider that which is a
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
nice way of saying anyways
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
um the federal match dollars I I think
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
is really and I think representative
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
Edwards said it was fear-mongering I
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
think that's extremely accurate
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
um to say that we're going to lose 182
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of funding
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
um right now I think would
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
would be a black eye for the Biden
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
Administration I think it would
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
um really pit us against CMS and
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
realistically what we're saying is we
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
are going to come into compliance we
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
just want to do this safely so no one
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
gets hurt again CMS having worked with
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
them around the country I've never met
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
one person from CMS that is gun ho of
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
taking funding away what they are gun ho
 
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
about is making sure that people getting
 
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
good Services getting quality services
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
and they're done at the right price
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Merchant
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
the more I listen to your testimony
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
more concerned I am that there's no plan
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's really been solidified to do a
 
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
pilot project on
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
so therefore if we don't have a real
 
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
solid plan where we're going to Pilot
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that we have a real
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
solid plan it's been well designed to do
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
a pilot project on or are we still
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
trying to design
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
pilot in order to implement the pilot
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
so what I would say is that we have half
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
of an idea and a good thought so the the
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
issue is and I don't mean the pilot
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
program I mean what a m has put together
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
and what we have so far with the bureau
 
00:54:47.089 --> 00:54:47.099 align:start position:0%
I think if we try to if this was a
 
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
rocket ship we would have maybe the
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
fuselage and no engine and if we try to
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
put this forward on July 1st we're going
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
to fail miserably
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to understand is that
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
we have part of the plan but we don't
 
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
have a real plan so come July 1
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
we can't even exercise in your opinion
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
if I understand it correctly both a
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
pilot program plus the full plan because
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have a plan to begin with it's
 
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
really been vetted and tested and so
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
forth on
 
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
a drawing board anywhere so if we're
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to go forward
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
how we can go forward with the pilot
 
00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:27.059 align:start position:0%
program if you don't have the plan the
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
would you be willing or somebody Maybe
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards to basically put
 
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
this contingent upon getting a waiver
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
from CMS I don't know how long it takes
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
to get one but I would be concerned that
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't get the waiver from CMS we
 
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.650 align:start position:0%
if we don't get the waiver from CMS we
are

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
at risk of losing the money so I don't
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
know how long it takes to get a waiver
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
but would you be opposed to having a
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
waiver crave depending upon what happens
 
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
so what I will say is that
 
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
we've worked the last two years under
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
the direction of BDS and DHHS to get us
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
to the point to where we can provide
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
these services in the methodology in a
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
way that they want us to do that we have
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
no regulations we as area agencies
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
cannot bill for the funding that we need
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that so
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
when they go to implement this like
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday I received an email from DHHS
 
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
saying that a part of what they
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
considered originally to be part of the
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
cap and that we had to come into
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
compliance with we're no longer doing
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
that up until a month ago we had no
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
contingency plan from BDS that was
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
shared with us
 
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
um and last Monday was the first time or
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
this yeah last Monday was the first time
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
or this Monday I'm sorry was the first
 
00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
time I've heard of dhhs's Desire want or
 
00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
will to actually pilot any of the stuff
 
00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:48.059 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
the last month a lot has been going on
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
at DHHS that they've realized that we're
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to do everything
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
come July 1st and they have scaled back
 
00:57:00.849 --> 00:57:00.859 align:start position:0%
dramatically and it continues to happen
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have an option to do
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
anything but pilot a program unless we
 
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:09.500 align:start position:0%
want to put our entire system at risk
 
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
I personally put the lives of the people
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
we support over 182 million dollars with
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
that being said my experience with CMS
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
is that they are very smart people and
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
they will work with us part of their
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
system to help States come into
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
compliance is they provide a technical
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
assistant someone that youth as a state
 
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
can go to and they can Shepherd you
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
through the compliance that you need to
 
00:57:38.809 --> 00:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
do to get to the other end if this was
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
such a concern why would we have
 
00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:44.339 align:start position:0%
scrapped two years ago everything the
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
state had already done the Investments
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
the area agencies had made
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
to now not only redo all that work over
 
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
four years but then add on all these
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
additional components if it was really
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
that much of a threat and a concern no
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
person in their right mind would ever do
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
that particularly anyone that
 
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
understands that this is going to affect
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
directly affect 7 500 people because
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's how many people we support not to
 
00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
mention the tens of thousands of staff
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
that support them and their families
 
00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking this question I let me
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
start off by saying I appreciate your
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
description of the Cooperative nature of
 
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
working with CMS we often hear that
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
government is corrupt and unworkable so
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your optimism uh my
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
question really is
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
um which is a superior choice if I
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly we could go
 
00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
ahead with this piloting program or we
 
00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
could just ask for an extension until we
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
are ready to to know that we can do it
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
and do it right maybe at that point we
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need a pilot program or maybe
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
we would still start with the pilot
 
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.569 align:start position:0%
we would still start with the pilot
program

00:59:05.569 --> 00:59:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
I think we regardless have to ask for an
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
extension I don't think there's a
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
there's a Avenue in which we don't uh or
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
let me say that I don't think there is a
 
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.230 align:start position:0%
let me say that I don't think there is a
um

00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
an intelligent way to move forward
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
without doing that or safe way but with
 
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
that being said I think no matter what
 
00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
we do because it affects so many lives
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
and so many businesses and the tangible
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
effects to our like the New Hampshire
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
economy Alone
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I think you have to do a pilot
 
00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:32.770 align:start position:0%
um I think you have to do a pilot
program

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:32.780 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:35.579 align:start position:0%
it's again getting back to doing change
 
00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
right not change for the sake of change
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't change it's disaster waiting to
 
00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.049 align:start position:0%
doesn't change it's disaster waiting to
happen

00:59:42.049 --> 00:59:42.059 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh you may not be the right person to
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
ask this question but you're the person
 
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
sitting in the chair so I'll I'll just
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
ask you and you can certainly defer if
 
00:59:56.569 --> 00:59:56.579 align:start position:0%
you'd rather not answer it
 
00:59:56.579 --> 00:59:59.270 align:start position:0%
you'd rather not answer it
um

00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
does the department if if we accept
 
01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
that the department is going to need a
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
waiver no matter what
 
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.049 align:start position:0%
waiver no matter what
because

01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:12.059 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
time is creeping on and we are no longer
 
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
young as representative McMahon might
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
acknowledge but aggressively mature and
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
progressing on to whatever the next
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
stage is
 
01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.210 align:start position:0%
stage is
um

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
if we get a waiver
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
and the collective wisdom of the people
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
around here was that yeah it would be
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
good idea to start with a pilot program
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
do we actually need legislation to do
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
that or is the purpose of legislation to
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
force DHHS to do things a certain way if
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
if they just chose to do this could they
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
do it this way without the legislation
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I would ask
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
that you read my testimony because all
 
01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
this has been done without the voices of
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
the people in this room and I mean the
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
family members if we're only going to
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
listen to One voice at the table let it
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
be the families and the individuals
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
um you know the area agency system I've
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
worked in different parts of the country
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
it's one of the best systems I've been
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
in but it has its problems they need to
 
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
be addressed there's not one CEO that I
 
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
know of and I've talked to of the area
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
agency system who doesn't say we need to
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
make changes if you talk to the DRC
 
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you we need to burn it down
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
and in some instances they're correct
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
because they can point to things that we
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
need to change we need to have unified
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
policies I think we should all have um
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
accreditation status so that we're not
 
01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
just meeting the state's minimum
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
requirements we're meeting the country's
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
best practices all those things cost
 
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
money and we don't have a lot of it but
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
we're spending we spent 20 million
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
dollars on a m as far as I know and that
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
number could be wrong
 
01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:54.260 align:start position:0%
um but that's what's been shared with me
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
to essentially revamp this entire system
 
01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:00.859 align:start position:0%
when we could have taken that money and
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
for a couple million dollars worth of
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
savings a year uh we could have taken
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
that money and we could have said uh
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
solved our out-of-state housing crisis
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
right now when a person needs congregate
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
level of care whether that's
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
behaviorally intensive or medically
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
intensive we have to send them out of
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
state to Florida Texas Massachusetts or
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania so if you have a loved one
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
you have to say goodbye to them because
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
they have to go to Florida for service
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
and treatment
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
the difference is in New Hampshire we
 
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
spend 365
 
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
000 at most those are four beds that I
 
01:02:36.049 --> 01:02:36.059 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
um for people who need palliative care
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
end of like treatment
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
we're spending up to seven hundred
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for someone who's not
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
even at that remote level of care to be
 
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
in Florida and it's a fifty thousand
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
dollar plane ticket one way back and
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
forth and it can be cheaper if we have
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
more people going and if we have more
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
people going we're spending more money
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
you bring those people back we can serve
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
them at a lot less money and we're going
 
01:03:03.049 --> 01:03:03.059 align:start position:0%
to save the state six six million
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
dollars annually
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
give me the 25 million dollars or give
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
it actually give it to the New Hampshire
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
housing fund let them manage it I I
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
don't have faith in the decisions being
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
made at this point that make the most
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
sense and the best example I can give
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
for that is even if we open up new
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
programs the the room and board budget
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
for the state is exhausted it's 2.5
 
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars and all that money is
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
gone it's going to room and board so you
 
01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
would assume if we have all these people
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
going out of state we need to start new
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
programs so let's increase the budget
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
come to you folks and ask for that money
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
I have inherited hide nor hair of that
 
01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
in three years that I've worked in the
 
01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
state as an area agency director it is
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
in the a m report that that's a problem
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
when we need to address it
 
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we needed to
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
spend 20 million dollars to figure out
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
though thank you other questions yes
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
um I've really enjoyed your testimony as
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
well was very enlightening
 
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
and this may or may not be related to
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about but it's really
 
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
important to me I really need to
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
understand this system and how it works
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
I was actually surprised with the number
 
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
7 500 I thought the number would be a
 
01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:18.059 align:start position:0%
lot bigger than that but can you give me
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding that the state is
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
divided functioning to six networks um
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
like Lakes Region Community Services one
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
and then they contract with other
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
agencies am I wrong about that and is
 
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
there some description somewhere the
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
entire system that I can look up and and
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
understand it tomorrow
 
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
understand it tomorrow
no

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:36.550 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:37.930 align:start position:0%
no
[Laughter]

01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:37.940 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
easiest answer sorry the way our system
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
works is BDS contracts with us we
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
provide Case Management Services we
 
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
figure out what an individual needs to
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
support them in their environment with
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
their families preferably or in their
 
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
own place uh congregate care settings
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
even though I'm here advocating for them
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
are a very it's a very minute need it's
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
think of it as like hospital setting of
 
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
care we want to put people in those
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
settings and then we want to transition
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
them as fast as humanly possible into
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
more individually based settings where
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
they can live their lives typically as
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
we all do but once we determine what
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
those persons needs are we then build a
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
um their service list and then we RFP it
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
out to our vendor agencies we contract
 
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
with so that's Easter Seals that's
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
Beckett that's life coping That's Life
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
Connections and those individuals turn
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
around and they say okay
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
an RFP could be for me Matt six two 260
 
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
pounds highly physically aggressive
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
um so what we want to do is we want to
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
have two to three staff with him it's
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
going to cost X Y and Z dollars to
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
support him where our system's unique is
 
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
that we capitate administrative costs
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
for area agencies at three percent of
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
that budget and nine percent for the
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
vendor so we we're not
 
01:05:59.210 --> 01:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
um building in a lot of cost with rate
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
buildup methodologies in other states
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
they have runaway budgets right now
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
because they have to I can profit as
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
much as I want in that um in that
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
environment so it incentivizes me
 
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
instead of taking Matt who's going to be
 
01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
very difficult to serve and maybe uh and
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
maybe you know cause some workers comps
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
claims I can take repnagel who's in the
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
same band but needs a lot less support
 
01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
and get that higher rate and and by the
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
way I'm not advocating that we don't get
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
rates by any means
 
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm just saying this is these are the
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
things that we actually need to figure
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
out before we jump headlong into this
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of anyone plummeting to
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
their death by looking before they leap
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
but I've heard of it with people just
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
jumped not knowing what was in front of
 
01:06:46.619 --> 01:06:47.510 align:start position:0%
jumped not knowing what was in front of
them

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
okay another question follow-up
 
01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.750 align:start position:0%
okay another question follow-up
follow-up

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
um so how do you interact like with
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
Community Bridges Lakes Region lrcs
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
whatever how do you interact with them
 
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
um a lot of it is Professional Knowledge
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
um you know I can tell my experience
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
here but
 
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.230 align:start position:0%
here but
um

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
those individuals have a lot of
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge and we did this with that and
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's how we get around
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
um and we were able to get that person
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
services or this is how we were able to
 
01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
um but then we also share
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
um resources so when we have like a
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
individual that
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
maybe I can't support the best I can
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
reach out to them and they may have a
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
vendor that they work with that works
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
specifically with people who need like
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
sign language but they may be
 
01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:42.380 align:start position:0%
behaviorally intensive at the same time
 
01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
so they're they're able to help we're

Institute of Health policy and he does
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%

the Indulgence of you and and the rest
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
for the record chairman McDonald thank
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
you very much uh members of the HHS
 
01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mark McLean
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro district 15 which
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
is Manchester Ward 8. I'm here to
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 69 which Builds on the
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
direct Primary Care legislation that we
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
passed two terms Ago by extending that
 
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
model to Health Care Facilities it
 
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
basically allows those Health Care
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
Facilities that operate on a
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
membership-based model or exclusively
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
take direct payment for services to be
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
excluded from the requirement to accept
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
all modes of payment so basically the
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
legislation is being brought forward in
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
attempt drive towards increased
 
01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
transparency in health care pricing to
 
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
kind of put some downward pressure on
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
costs and to introduce new service
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
models in under serve communities so I
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
think one of the areas where the
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act fell short in my
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
estimation was it really was promising
 
01:10:47.689 --> 01:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
to bring health care costs under control
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
and a key element that was discussed at
 
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
the time was um to introduce clearer
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
more understandable pricing information
 
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
that would encourage people to shop
 
01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:00.380 align:start position:0%
around and enhance competition
 
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that never happened and
 
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
Health care billing today remains just
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
as Byzantine as it's ever been
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
when I filed the legislation I got a
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
call almost immediately from the
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and to be up front
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know they're not supporting this but
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
we had a great conversation and they
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
really were able to you know graciously
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
kind of put me through some of their
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill one of the things
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
that they're saying on the transparency
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
front is us saying listen we already
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
comply with all the legal requirements
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
and on top of that the federal no
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
surprises act which has been
 
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored by Senator Hassan is going
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
to be coming in and that's going to be
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
bringing even greater transparency
 
01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
um and it's going to requiring
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
comprehensive good faith estimates for
 
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
services rendered and everything that we
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
had and it was very great conversation
 
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
and everything that was put forth in
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
that conversation was correct I think
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
really the only thing that disappointed
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
me about the conversation was just that
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
I agree that the the hospital
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
Association and other agencies are doing
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
everything that they can to comply with
 
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
the law when it comes to pricing
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
transparency but it seems that they stop
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
there and they don't go beyond that and
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
I think for me personally that's a shame
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
because I think that that is where the
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
Brain Trust is that's where the
 
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
knowledge is and I would like to see
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
um the agencies like the hospital
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
Association really kind of taking the
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
leads and and not waiting for the
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm also concerned a little
 
01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
bit though about the no surprises act
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I have a feeling that it may not
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
deliver as promised and it may actually
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
lead to inflated inflated pricing I love
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
the concept of the bill to be honest
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
with it I loved it so much that in the
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
last term I brought in HB 264 which
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
basically did the exact same uh thing as
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
no surprises but at the state level but
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
when I went over to Chairman hunt in the
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee I got crushed I got
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
crushed by chairman Hans I got crushed
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
by the committee I got crossed by the
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
hospital Association I got crushed by
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
the deputy the insurance commissioner
 
01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
because they're saying look the cost
 
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
structure is so complex that if you try
 
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
to do this it's actually potentially
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
going to create more inflated pricing
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
because maybe people are going to you
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
know kind of inflate their quotes things
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
that and so
 
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
um I really hope no surprises does what
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
it promises to do but I have a hunch
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
that it may fall prey to some of the
 
01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
pitfalls that were revealed when I
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
brought forth um HB uh 264. hb69 by
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
contrast is much more alexandrian and
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
that it kind of cuts through the tangle
 
01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:45.179 align:start position:0%
of the Health care billing by
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
introducing the direct pay model for
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
that model to work you truly have to be
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
transparent and because most people get
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
their insurance from commercial Market
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
or enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid I
 
01:13:58.610 --> 01:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
think the usage rates are facilities
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
using this model will likely be
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
relatively low but for those who are
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
uninsured self-insured or high
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
deductibles the idea of having uh good
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what your upfront pricing
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
is in the colonoscopy that may have
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
um enormous appeal for you and even a
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
small amount of competition May generate
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
change releasing facilities as well from
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
the all-payer model will also release
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
them from the enormous administrative
 
01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
burden that that engenders doctors
 
01:14:30.169 --> 01:14:30.179 align:start position:0%
become doctors because of the desire to
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
help others they're not accountants and
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be accountants and
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
close to half the administrative burden
 
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
in operating a facility is tied to
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
billing so if that can be eliminated the
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
potential in expansion of services may
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
be there um it won't be for everyone but
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
it will introduce competition new
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
approaches and possibly exposure to
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
Innovative new ways to deliver Health
 
01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
Care one of the main objections to hb69
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
in the past is to fear that it will
 
01:14:59.930 --> 01:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
decimate New Hampshire's critical access
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals I personally think that the
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
uptake rate is not going to be high
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
enough and so any immediate effect would
 
01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
be blunted
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
um but there are a lot of protections
 
01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
for critical access hospitals the
 
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
exclusion Zone remains intact the 101
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare reimbursement remains intact
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
the 24 7 emergency room requirement
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
remains intact none of those are changed
 
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
so the critical access hospitals are
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
still heavily armored against
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
competition but I asked the committee a
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
question are we protecting critical
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
access hospitals merely for the state
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
sake of protecting critical access
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals the reason that the federal
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
critical access act went into effect in
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
1997 was an attempt to preserve Health
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
Care access in the nation's rural
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
communities ultimately we have to
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
remember that's the real goal preserving
 
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:52.820 align:start position:0%
and ultimately expanding access in those
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
communities so one of the ways I think
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
that the critical access law actually
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
impedes the expansion of access is at a
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
caps the amount of hospital beds for
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
example at 25. so I asked legislative
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
research about you know Trends in bed
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
count throughout the state and and what
 
01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
I quickly discovered is Alice Peck 25
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
beds androscogan Valley 25 beds Cottage
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
Hospital 25 beds Franklin Hospital 25
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
beds Huggins Hospital 25 beds I'm not
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
going to go through the whole list in
 
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
the interest of time but I think you get
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
the idea so even if the hospitals wanted
 
01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
to staff beyond the 25 bed count I don't
 
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
think it's going to happen because
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're very concerned about preserving
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
their status as a critical access
 
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
hospital so recognizing this I think if
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
new methodologies are offered that may
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
offer an alternative way to expand
 
01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:48.659 align:start position:0%
access should they not be explored I'll
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
just leave you with this one note
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
because I know we're pressed for time
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
with Mr Rhodes but consider if you will
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
the way that the state has sought to
 
01:16:57.169 --> 01:16:57.179 align:start position:0%
expand the use of renewable energy
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
whether you like them or not Vehicles
 
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
like the renewable portfolio standard
 
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
energy efficient resource standards they
 
01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
were brought into being so that the
 
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
state could explore different renewable
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
options and ways to bring them to the
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
marketplace we have an all of the above
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
approach when it comes to going into
 
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
Renewables why then do we seem to be
 
01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
Tethered to a single path when it comes
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
to providing Health Care you know I
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
think that at a time when medical access
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
is increasingly under threat we should
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
just like with the renewable energy go
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
and consider an awe of the above
 
01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.209 align:start position:0%
and consider an awe of the above
approach

01:17:31.209 --> 01:17:31.219 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my testimony in the
 
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
interest of time and because Mr Rhodes
 
01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:40.739 align:start position:0%
has a flight it has to leave at 10 45 I
 
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
would respectfully ask if you could
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
defer questions to him if that's
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
possible thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
you representative McLean
 
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Rhodes would you like to come
 
01:17:59.450 --> 01:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:00.860 align:start position:0%
hey thank you
 
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson Vice chair Leon and
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify on House Bill
 
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
69. my name is Jared Rhodes I am a
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
health policy researcher affiliated with
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
the mercatus center at George Mason
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
University in Arlington Virginia and I'm
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
also an adjunct instructor at the
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Institute for health policy
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
and clinical practice in Hanover New
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I live in Lebanon New
 
01:18:25.739 --> 01:18:26.689 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I live in Lebanon New
Hampshire

01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here today as an individual not a
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative of of those institutions
 
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm here to say that I support
 
01:18:36.649 --> 01:18:36.659 align:start position:0%
hb69 uh the main reason that I support
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
the bill is I believe the residents of
 
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would benefit from
 
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
allowing direct pay Healthcare
 
01:18:45.370 --> 01:18:45.380 align:start position:0%
facilities to operate in this state and
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
passage of hb69 would be a step in that
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
direction I think under current law New
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire requires Health Care
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
Facilities to provide services
 
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
regardless of the source of payment and
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
this requirement to accept all payment
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
sources it may be a non-issue for large
 
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
hospitals or large Health Systems who
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually see size and as an advantage
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
but it creates a uniquely impossible
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
hurdle for one particular type of
 
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility and that's direct
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
pay Healthcare facilities a direct pay
 
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
health care facility is a facility that
 
01:19:20.770 --> 01:19:20.780 align:start position:0%
accepts only Cash
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
Direct pay facilities don't accept
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
payment from third parties insurance
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
companies or government programs the
 
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
reason they do this is to simplify their
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
business practices and eliminate the
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
administrative overhead associated with
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with multiple payers each with
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
its own paperwork and processes and
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
contracts the efficiency gain that it
 
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
gets plus the the sort of discipline
 
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
that comes from competing on prices that
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be naturally transparent
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
because you're dealing with you know
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
advertising to Consumers means that the
 
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
the prices at direct pay facilities can
 
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
be anywhere from 1 8 to 1 10 of the
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
prices of other facilities who are paid
 
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
through through Insurance a
 
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
tonsillectomy for instance that might be
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand dollars if you're paying
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
for it through Insurance could be three
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars direct pay or a
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
gallbladder surgery with a liver biopsy
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's twenty three thousand dollars of
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
paid through Insurance could be seven
 
01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
thousand direct pay
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
the ability to accept just one simple
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
streamlined source of payment is the
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
whole direct pay model by not accepting
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh payments from Myriad payers direct
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
pay facilities can have fewer
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
administrative staff maybe they have a
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
smaller building uh their Physicians can
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
spend less time going back and forth
 
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
with payers about coverage benefits and
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
prior authorizations and co-pays and so
 
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.649 align:start position:0%
prior authorizations and co-pays and so
forth

01:20:41.649 --> 01:20:41.659 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
direct pay facilities do exist in other
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
states this is not a brand new idea and
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
we could have them here too but our
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
current requirement that Healthcare
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
facilities accept all payment sources in
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
effect makes the direct pay uh pay
 
01:20:59.689 --> 01:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
business model impossible
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
um so in summary keeping this brief um I
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
believe our our status quo is is wrong
 
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
in in at least two ways first it's it's
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
actually unjust I think to the
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial Physicians and surgeons
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
who would like to open uh and operate a
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
facility under this model
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
um and then second uh it does not serve
 
01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
the health care interests of New
 
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents who would I think
 
01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
benefit from having greater choice and
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
cheaper alternatives uh for their care
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons I I support hb69
 
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you you're taking questions sir
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you very
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question
 
01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.270 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question
um

01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
could you outline for us specifically
 
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
what kinds of facilities are covered by
 
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
this bill because it is in the section
 
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
this bill because it is in the section
on

01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.370 align:start position:0%
on
um

01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:57.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals and
 
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.130 align:start position:0%
hospitals and
um

01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
Healthcare facility residential care and
 
01:22:06.649 --> 01:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
health facilities and I'm never very
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
clear exactly what is covered by that
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
right I I might need some help
 
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
understanding some of that too but the
 
01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
the my remarks today are have in mind
 
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
the the Standalone uh surgical you know
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
day ambulatory Surgical Center kind of
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
model that's that's what I'm
 
01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:28.820 align:start position:0%
um uh referring to in in my remarks
 
01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:31.820 align:start position:0%
and may I have one more Mr chair
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
my other question is
 
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:35.689 align:start position:0%
my other question is
um

01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
isn't the problem
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
understanding all the issues of billing
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
which are very valid uh isn't the
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
problem with this kind of service that
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
it Cherry picks
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
the people who are able to pay in full
 
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.830 align:start position:0%
the people who are able to pay in full
themselves

01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
thereby ensuring that
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's not the problem with the critical
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
care access is they will then only get
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
the people who are the neediest and the
 
01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
least insured and the least able to pay
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
thereby jeopardizing their status
 
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure that uh there's uh
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
that they're competing for the same
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
people here that they're competing for
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
the same patients and consumers
 
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
um there I think the number uh as we
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
heard from um Mr McLean the the number
 
01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
of uh facilities that would open would
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
be probably relatively small
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
um there are there's a relatively small
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
number of these types of facilities in
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh operation uh in in other states
 
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh it's it's it's not um it's
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
not at the scale that uh that that we've
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
seen uh creates a lot of tension between
 
01:23:54.169 --> 01:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah this uh on that issue that
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
you identify
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and I think what it what it actually
 
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
does is is offers an alternative to
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
um uh to to people who uh would like to
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
use this model
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
um some of which some of whom might be
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
uninsured themselves so it's it's not as
 
01:24:11.689 --> 01:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
if they're this is not quite the you
 
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
know if you're thinking of this and and
 
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
and ideas of uh you know oh this is
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
concierge medicine for the Rich and
 
01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
Famous I I don't think that's the case
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's actually the the reason it
 
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
appeals to a lot of people is because of
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
the lower prices because it's something
 
01:24:26.689 --> 01:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
that they actually can't afford it can
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
be more expensive to go uh the insurance
 
01:24:28.679 --> 01:24:31.149 align:start position:0%
be more expensive to go uh the insurance
route

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.159 --> 01:24:33.110 align:start position:0%

King
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald
 
01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.070 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald
um

01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of patients or consumers
 
01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
following you know riffing on
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Weber what kind of
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
patients or consumers are drawn to
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
direct pay health care facilities thank
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
you good question so it could be uh an
 
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
individual who's uninsured it could be a
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
person who is uh
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
thinking of themselves as self-insured
 
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh maybe they're they're a small
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
business owner they don't
 
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
um they're not buying a you know part of
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
a participating in a group small group
 
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
plan for themselves they have uh they
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
would like to purchase a catastrophic
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
care plan a high deductible health
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
insurance and then pay for these sorts
 
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:21.020 align:start position:0%
of other
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
smaller procedures and services
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
themselves uh because they they view
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
that as a better than going the
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
insurance route so those are some of the
 
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
the types of people yes representative
 
01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um uh in that
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
they take cash only they don't take
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
Federal insurance Medicare Medicaid are
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
they required to see any and all
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
patients that come through the door and
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
take care of them when they come through
 
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
the door regardless of ability to pay
 
01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:53.219 align:start position:0%
right well I think that there's still
 
01:25:53.219 --> 01:25:54.169 align:start position:0%
right well I think that there's still
some

01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
um some some statutes in in uh in effect
 
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
that requires uh for instance a
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
um addressing that right there's a uh I
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
think it is that that you must have a
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
financial assistance plan and and post
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
that and offer that right my
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that's part of
 
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
section 151-2 through F and that that
 
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
would still be uh in in play
 
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
um so and a lot of in in experience
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
um a lot of these places do offer that
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
too they will um they can offer
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
um payment plans even to uh to people
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
who want to to pay for things over a
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
long period of time in case they can't
 
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
afford it all in one go
 
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm seeing some similar we know that
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
this is a similar model to the direct
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
Primary Care model that we have in New
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um and I happen to be a
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
consumer of a primary care doctor who
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
uses that model and
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
um after I had my baby recently and
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't working
 
01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
um she actually suspended my payments
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
um completely and kept me on as a
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
patient and um do you think that there's
 
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
anything that's do do you see that um
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
these kind of Health Care Facilities
 
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
will also be similar in that fashion
 
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
that they may be you know the in the
 
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
interest of having
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
um return customers and um encouraging
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
people to who need this alternative
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
um to seek their services first of all
 
01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
congratulations on the baby and I I
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
think yes um I think there's a great
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
um this this really does bring the
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
patient The Physician Physicians
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
together uh there's no other third party
 
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
involved and so you have a a closer
 
01:27:55.129 --> 01:27:55.139 align:start position:0%
alignment of of Interest I think and um
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
this kind of return customer kind of um
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know model in ethos I think it's
 
01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
good for for that relationship and so
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
um yeah I've sort of you know certainly
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I've heard of of those kinds
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
of uh those those sorts of things
 
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:10.310 align:start position:0%
of uh those those sorts of things
happening

01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and and one other point that that
 
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
that comes out of what you said uh which
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
is that I do think this is a good
 
01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:22.139 align:start position:0%
compliment for um direct primary care we
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
have a a small but but healthy and
 
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
growing uh direct Primary Care kind of
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
seen here in in New Hampshire which I
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
think is a good thing uh it's a nice
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
once again just another alternative it
 
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
might be right for you it might not be
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
right for somebody else but it might be
 
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
right for you and if you go that route
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
with the direct primary care now you
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a really good
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
um option that that's compatible with
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
that that that that it doesn't make you
 
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
feel like well I I'm going direct
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
primary care for my primary care but now
 
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
I have to but I'm but I'm double paying
 
01:28:52.729 --> 01:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
almost for for health insurance I'm
 
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
gonna buy it but not use it right so
 
01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
you've already made that decision to go
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
that route and so this you know having a
 
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
direct pay Healthcare facility is going
 
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
to be really
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
um uh good for you and anybody who goes
 
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
that so I think it actually uh
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
reinforces and helps the um the direct
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
Primary Care scene grow
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
um both of both you and the
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
representative who testified talked
 
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
about a a very minimal uptake of these
 
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
kinds of programs and um
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
you know unfortunately
 
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
um in my mind we've experienced in New
 
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a program that was also
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
predicted to be very minimal but has
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
expanded dramatically the education
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts and so I'm wondering if
 
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.310 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts and so I'm wondering if
um

01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
in terms of the overall impact in terms
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
of the policies that would protect
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
people who are really Indigent and
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay
 
01:30:03.850 --> 01:30:03.860 align:start position:0%
in terms of the policies that um
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative cushman's provider
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
gave out of the goodness of their heart
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of those kinds of protections
 
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
could you imagine writing
 
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
some of those protections actually into
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
the legislation so we would be assured
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
that this would have minimal impact on
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
other providers
 
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I suppose but I'm not sure what those
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
would be uh exactly I mean I think I
 
01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
think it's a good approach here is to to
 
01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
think of
 
01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.310 align:start position:0%
think of
the

01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
landscape of options that are out there
 
01:30:44.209 --> 01:30:44.219 align:start position:0%
and and not every option has to
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
satisfy the entire market and and so you
 
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
can have different components that are
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
optimal for different compo parts of the
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
market that and so that's what I I guess
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
that would be my um
 
01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:00.950 align:start position:0%
that would be my um
uh

01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
that'd be that'd be my response on that
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
I think I think that this is this is a
 
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
good option for a particular
 
01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:10.940 align:start position:0%
um uh type of you know patient
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
particular type of consumer out there
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
um and allowing that to flourish
 
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me to be in conflict
 
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
taking the question I have actually a
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
request along with a question uh the
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
first is
 
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
as a university doing some research in
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
this area I assume that some sort of a
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
study out there talking about at the
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented this policy
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
and what impact has had around that
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
facility there's some sort of data out
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
there that you can share with us there
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
aren't any big studies on this
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's a it's a relatively
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
new area I mean I've done uh I recently
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
authored a a large report for working
 
01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
with the Saint Anselm uh Center for for
 
01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
ethics and society that looked at both
 
01:32:04.490 --> 01:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
direct primary care and
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and direct pay facilities and and
 
01:32:08.209 --> 01:32:08.219 align:start position:0%
sort of what
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
um you know what what does the landscape
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
of those look like but it's not we don't
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
have a national measurement of of all
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
these or an analysis state by state of
 
01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
how this has played out in all states my
 
01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
report was looking at New Hampshire for
 
01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:22.610 align:start position:0%
report was looking at New Hampshire for
instance

01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:32:25.330 --> 01:32:25.340 align:start position:0%
um it's a relatively new
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
idea and uh and there's not a lot of
 
01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
Health economists that I know that are
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
that are examining it so by can we say
 
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
to them quick thank you Mr chair so to
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
restate it we don't really know the
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
impact through research
 
01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.290 align:start position:0%
impact through research
we

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
there's no research out there to talk
 
01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
about the impact it has on the local
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
area health-wise as far as the
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
right okay yeah I'll be clear about that
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
number two is my understanding is that
 
01:32:58.729 --> 01:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
census is cash only it would not be
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
included in the patient's deductible so
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
if they do end up going to a facility to
 
01:33:05.689 --> 01:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
use their insurance policy all the money
 
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
they paid through cash would not be
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
considered part of the deductible would
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
that be true that is correct yeah and
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
and that's actually
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
um that could be actually thought of as
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
a protection I I mean I suppose I mean
 
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of I mean it's it's it's
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
on the the patient to be saying all
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
right um if I'm willing to do that it
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
must be a really good deal and
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
um and so you know that that could be
 
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
part of the limitation there if you're
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
if you're you know concerned about it
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
spreading too fast or something like
 
01:33:36.890 --> 01:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
that the in practice what we tend to see
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
is um that the the the price differences
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
in the uh are are such great that even
 
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:46.340 align:start position:0%
even with you know even being covered
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
for for it someplace else at a higher
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
price you know I mean and you could if
 
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
if uh if your insurance is offering to
 
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
to cover 80 percent of uh fifty thousand
 
01:33:57.649 --> 01:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
dollar surgery well but you could get
 
01:33:59.570 --> 01:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
that surgery for five thousand out of
 
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
pocket over here you know doing doing
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers it might still make sense to
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
just pay for it so that's that's how a
 
01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
lot of the the personal calculations end
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
up being representative lay on and then
 
01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh thank you Mr
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we struggled with
 
01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of Charity Care is
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
defaulting to State paid
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
um I I'm looking at this model and at
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
the lower cost it seems like it could be
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
a good Avenue for a charity care except
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill says that it's
 
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
paid directly by the patient and is not
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursed or otherwise paid by a third
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
party I'm wondering if changing that to
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
say and is not billed to a third party
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
would allow somebody to voluntarily
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
contribute to cover the cost to people
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
care anyways anywhere and would be a
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
drain drain on the system but unable to
 
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
pay their their way
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
yet that's a creative creative idea um
 
01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
and it might yeah that might that might
 
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
be good I'm not I'm trying to think of
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
um you know whether I've heard of that
 
01:34:59.209 --> 01:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
in other states I don't think I have so
 
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh that could be something that you'd
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
that you'd consider adding to this yeah
 
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:06.659 align:start position:0%
okay representative Weber
 
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of tangentially exploring that
 
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
same concept but from the other
 
01:35:11.699 --> 01:35:12.910 align:start position:0%
same concept but from the other
direction

01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh we heard
 
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
whatever one's thoughts are in the
 
01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:19.790 align:start position:0%
whatever one's thoughts are in the
charitable

01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
um notion of this
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
which is completely Unwritten into the
 
01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:25.990 align:start position:0%
which is completely Unwritten into the
bill

01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
people said well you know there they
 
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
have to have an assistance plan but
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
isn't that Assistance Plan made a
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
complete mockery of by the fact that you
 
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
have absolutely Institution
 
01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
by this bill has no requirement of any
 
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
sort to provide any care to anybody who
 
01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what was the question the
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
question is isn't it true that no matter
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
what all these speculations are about
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
charitable payments or payment you know
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
payment plans the institution itself is
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
under no obligation of any sort to
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
provide any sort of charity care
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
yeah the only
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I can point to is the
 
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
um the part about the financial
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
assistance plan and so yeah I don't know
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
how far that goes Etc or what other
 
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
components there are thank you
 
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel Mr chairman
 
01:36:32.209 --> 01:36:32.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you're aware of this model
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
already exists I can fly to Thailand
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and have this done at a
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
substantially lower cost than I can have
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
it done here what I'm struggling with
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
the issue again looking at other states
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
um I understand direct patient care in a
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
primary care setting I'm struggling to
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
understand the volumes that you're going
 
01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
to need to create and run a health care
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
facility that there can be enough people
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
does that work in other states
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um I mean one of the most
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
successful examples of this is it comes
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
from Oklahoma there's a a couple of
 
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
Physicians started uh something that
 
01:37:07.209 --> 01:37:07.219 align:start position:0%
they call the surgery center of Oklahoma
 
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
back in the late 90s and they've been
 
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
they've been uh in you know successful
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
and growing ever since then
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
um they you know a couple of their
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
Hallmarks is a very transparent pricing
 
01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:21.179 align:start position:0%
I mean as soon as they had a website
 
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
they were putting their their prices out
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the website and um and also other
 
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
other kinds of things that some
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
academics think of as as amazing uh
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
breakthroughs it's totally natural for
 
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
them for instance to do bundle pricing
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
and just and to say okay for for this
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
type of surgery whatever else might may
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
or may not be involved it's just one one
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
single price and so you're not getting
 
01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:46.139 align:start position:0%
um uh you you're not getting like a
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
facility fee and a physician fee and a
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
surgical fee and an anesthesiology fee
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
and everything uh kind of um uh
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
piecemeal like that
 
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and so yeah so that's um so we have
 
01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
some of these other uh examples there's
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's an example that I talk about as
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
well in in the report that I can share
 
01:38:04.199 --> 01:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
well in in the report that I can share
about

01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
um a surgical center in Arkansas as well
 
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
uh Colorado
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
um you don't have to go to Thailand um
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
you can go to these other places but it
 
01:38:16.729 --> 01:38:16.739 align:start position:0%
would be even night nicer if you could
 
01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
do it right here in New Hampshire is is
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
how I'm I'm thinking of it
 
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
hey you are you up for any more
 
01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
questions or you gotta get going I uh I
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
think I have to go I'm sorry
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%

House Bill 69 and I do appreciate

representative McLean um talking with me
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
he was very gracious in his time when I
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
did reach out as soon as um I saw this
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill or the LSR actually so I do
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and I wanted to
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that I also will go over my
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
testimony but um since critical access
 
01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
hospitals came up since I have been at
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association when I first
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
started I am uniquely qualified to talk
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
about critical access hospitals because
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
I helped them convert from a PPS
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
hospital or a non-critical access
 
01:41:44.169 --> 01:41:44.179 align:start position:0%
hospital to a critical access hospital
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
so I believe that even though I tend to
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
not comment on others testimonies unless
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
asked I do believe that it is
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate for me to State since I
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
think it was representative Weber asked
 
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
relative to how critical access
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals could be impacted by this a 80
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
percent and I think that's very
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
important eighty percent of services
 
01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
provided by critical access hospitals
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
are outpatient including
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
um outpatient surgery so just keep that
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
um because our critical access hospitals
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
which I think are near and dear to our
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
hearts um in the state certainly half of
 
01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
them are critical access hospitals we
 
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
could not survive without them so I
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
think that is very important to consider
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to to make that point
 
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer other questions but
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
again my my policy our policy is to not
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
comment on others testimony unless asked
 
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:42.179 align:start position:0%
thank you questions no I I'm not oh
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
um I I do um I do have my testimony um
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
the bill does exempt facilities
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
operating with membership based or
 
01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
direct payment business models from
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
certain health facility licensing
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
requirements as stated and I will skip
 
01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:01.790 align:start position:0%
requirements as stated and I will skip
down

01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:02.390 align:start position:0%
down
um

01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh to I think it was against
 
01:43:07.490 --> 01:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative Weber was asking which
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
specific facilities
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and so it would include all hospitals
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
um including residential care and
 
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities it would
 
01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:18.410 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities it would
include

01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
um uh Ambulatory Surgery centers excuse
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
me it's not long-term care sorry it was
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
it they're excluded but other health
 
01:43:28.209 --> 01:43:28.219 align:start position:0%
care facilities would be including
 
01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers hospice
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
facilities urgent care centers birthing
 
01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
centers in addition any special Health
 
01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
Care license which is includes cardiac
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
catheterization which they are they can
 
01:43:43.729 --> 01:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
be freestanding open heart surgery which
 
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
are not freestanding and our bypass and
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
mega voltage radiation which can also be
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
freestanding this bill would allow for
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
these types of facilities if if they
 
01:43:57.649 --> 01:43:57.659 align:start position:0%
exclusively provide services to persons
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
who are membership based or make direct
 
01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
payments to not accept all patients and
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
I think that goes to representative
 
01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
Murphy's point and that is a very big
 
01:44:09.169 --> 01:44:09.179 align:start position:0%
concern and I think the state of New
 
01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the legislature should
 
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
think about that from a policy
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
perspective they if they can't pay for
 
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
those Services
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
um these these individuals
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
um would not be eligible for charity
 
01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
care Etc the hospitals fall under this
 
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
statute and provide care to all patients
 
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
which I think is very important this is
 
01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:30.260 align:start position:0%
a cherry picking
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity as I think representative
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
Weber addressed
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'm also not aware of it's not wrapping
 
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
up please yes um I'm also not aware of
 
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
other facilities I would I would um
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate um seeing if they're what
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
other facilities throughout the country
 
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
but if you talk about Ambulatory Surgery
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
centers this this bill does not limit to
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers so our all
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
our hospitals would be impacted and I
 
01:44:58.729 --> 01:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
just want to leave um leave this um
 
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
thought with you that if you were to
 
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
01:45:04.729 --> 01:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
um what would happen if you had a
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
freestanding emergency room which is
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
allowable in this state if you have a
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
membership base and you have a gate at
 
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
the entrance saying that um at three
 
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning if uh just drop
 
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
parent with a sick child shows up and it
 
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
says for members only will there be a
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
gate if you um and then what happens to
 
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
that to that family that is um that is
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
really a chilling thought
 
01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
um we do not believe that this bill is
 
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the legislature to
 
01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:32.300 align:start position:0%
endorse this type of Health Care model
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
that excludes citizens from access to
 
01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
services and and we ask that you find
 
01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to legislate I'm
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:44.570 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
um everybody's mentioned you know
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
outpatient surgeries and freestanding
 
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
surgical surgical centers uh Etc but
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
does this also include uh freestanding
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
Radiology Suites like MRI Suites yeah um
 
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
actually they are not licensed under
 
01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
health facilities in the state of New
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so they would not be included
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
so they would not be included in this
 
01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill they could they could do this
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
independent of whether this bill without
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill they could do it independently
 
01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
now thank you um and I I think the other
 
01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
thing is on the direct Primary Care
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
model is under as I believe you know um
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
since um you fall under this statute is
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
under the Board of Medicine
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
um licensing so direct primary care has
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this um and I think
 
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
that it's important that everyone
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
understand that that is completely
 
01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
separate from what this is this is
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
licensing of Health Care facilities and
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
what all that means relative to charity
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
care Etc
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Miss
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
minahan for answering questions
 
01:46:54.169 --> 01:46:54.179 align:start position:0%
it seems like one of your biggest fears
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
is the possibility that a sick child
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
gets brought to an emergency room at 3am
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
only to find out that oh it's you know
 
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
members only and then something really
 
01:47:07.450 --> 01:47:07.460 align:start position:0%
bad happens as a result of that
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
these types of situations exist in other
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
states in other countries is there any
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
evidence to support that having happened
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
like do we have you know children that
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
have died because they've been taken or
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
is this just totally hypothetical no no
 
01:47:25.490 --> 01:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
evidence to back that up thank you
 
01:47:27.169 --> 01:47:27.179 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question this is
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
not my only concern I think I raised the
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
issue of our critical access hospitals I
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
am just it's a hypothetical because if
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
you were to pass this bill that
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
effectively could happen because this is
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
not limited to one type of facility and
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
again even if it were to limit it to
 
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers then we have
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
the issue of the critical access
 
01:47:53.090 --> 01:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
hospitals not being able to effectively
 
01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
treat to take care of the patients that
 
01:47:58.490 --> 01:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
they have and if you're cherry picking
 
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
so it was just a hypothetical I've never
 
01:48:03.050 --> 01:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
heard of such a system like this
 
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
anywhere to be honest in at least in the
 
01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
country I I don't know about the other
 
01:48:10.729 --> 01:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
countries representative Nagel thank you
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.729 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
question

01:48:13.729 --> 01:48:13.739 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
um we brought up direct Primary Care
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
earlier and most a lot of the healthcare
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
I think all the health care facilities
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
in the state do provide primary care and
 
01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
that part of your Revenue generation is
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
the direct primary care options in this
 
01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
state has that affected your services at
 
01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:31.609 align:start position:0%
state has that affected your services at
all

01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I do not have any data to
 
01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
um to refer to so I cannot actually
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
answer that question effectively I don't
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
know how many there are to be honest
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer thank you Mr
 
01:48:46.129 --> 01:48:46.139 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:48:46.139 --> 01:48:47.390 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
um going back to critical critical
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
access hospitals so
 
01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
um I'm remembering a surgical center
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
opening up next to Valley Regional
 
01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
Hospital when I worked there back in the
 
01:48:58.609 --> 01:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
90s this was actually before critical
 
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
accessibility nearly bankrupted the
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
hospital because they siphoned away a
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
lot of things it's a little bit of a
 
01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
different issue because it didn't have
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
to do with the payment model
 
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
but um my question is
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
um do you or can you get through other
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
state hospital associations any data on
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
what's happened in States that's had
 
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
this so we can see if there has been a
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
detriment because I know like our
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
critical Hospital you know there's no
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
margin so if we lose if we lose 10
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
percent of
 
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
of procedures that get reimbursed well
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in big trouble and I
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
think that's true in both New Hampshire
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
and Vermont
 
01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
um I last year when this similar bill
 
01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
was introduced I did reach out to my
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues throughout the country and
 
01:49:45.890 --> 01:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
again no one had heard of this I'm very
 
01:49:49.609 --> 01:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
interested in in learning um about the
 
01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
states that apparently have this but it
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's specific to Ambulatory
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
Surgery centers but to your point
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
um that is the re what you just
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
described back in the 90s is why
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
Congress passed the critical access
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals law to ensure that that
 
01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
hospitals like Valley Regional would not
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
go away because that is exactly what was
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
happening with so many critical small
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
hospitals throughout the country the
 
01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
other thing that you're reminding me of
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
is um the comment that that
 
01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:26.219 align:start position:0%
representative McLean made relative to
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
the license number of licensed beds
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
throughout the for all critical access
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals that is a that is a statutory
 
01:50:35.450 --> 01:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
requirement of and you know that because
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
you um you are in the critical access
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital service area so um they cannot
 
01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
by law um in order to be a critical
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
access Hospital you have to follow a lot
 
01:50:47.450 --> 01:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
of regulations like I said that's what I
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
helped the hospitals do working with the
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
state back um in 2001 through 2005. so
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
they cannot have more than 25 beds or
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
else they would not be considered a
 
01:50:59.570 --> 01:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
critical access Hospital hence why that
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
their license has 25 beds other
 
01:51:03.119 --> 01:51:05.390 align:start position:0%
their license has 25 beds other
questions

01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.129 --> 01:51:13.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I need to get a longer hand
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
at least an arm
 
01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
instead of looking at this as a
 
01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
potential Devastation to the hospitals
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
west of event the hospital taking a
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
larger area with population wise
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
opening up their own cash only facility
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
directly owned by the hospital per se
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
but it's part of the Health Care system
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
is there anything to say the Health Care
 
01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
system through a legal entity where you
 
01:51:41.689 --> 01:51:41.699 align:start position:0%
have a separate cooperation that the
 
01:51:44.209 --> 01:51:44.219 align:start position:0%
hospital system could in fact have in
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
some of the larger areas in our state
 
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
such a facility like this without having
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
to be competitive to you but instead of
 
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
turning the tables the other way and you
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
become more the person competing in this
 
01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:56.030 align:start position:0%
become more the person competing in this
Marketplace

01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
Marketplace
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
not under the current licensing regime
 
01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.609 align:start position:0%
not under the current licensing regime
because

01:52:01.609 --> 01:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
under the current one but if we change
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
it what I'm saying is at that point in
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
time and we allow for this to occur is
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
there anything to Bar a hospital through
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
a separate corporation which is not
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
directly owned by the hospital from
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
getting into this kind of a Marketplace
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
on their own I
 
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
probably cannot answer that question
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
um anything that falls under the
 
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
hospital though falls under Federal
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
requirements and of course they cannot
 
01:52:31.729 --> 01:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
and would not
 
01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
um discriminate based on ability to pay
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
so that that is their mission
 
01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
um and I think um they would not be
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
eager to entertain that kind of a model
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
um whether it's allowable or not
 
01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
um because that would not I think their
 
01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees would would look
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
unfavorably upon that um because it's
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against those that cannot
 
01:52:57.890 --> 01:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
pay and that is that certainly is not
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
their mission
 
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here my
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
question uh touches back on
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants you said that
 
01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:09.659 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are would be prohibited
 
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
from doing that from federal law is that
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
because they take Medicare and Medicaid
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
payments or is there any other aspects
 
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
that make them subject to federal law on
 
01:53:21.169 --> 01:53:21.179 align:start position:0%
how they operate so erisa
 
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
um the excuse me um mtala um if you have
 
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
a um a mtala which is the emergency
 
01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:32.219 align:start position:0%
medical law would require anyone that is
 
01:53:35.090 --> 01:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
a hospital to take everyone that comes
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
through the door so that has nothing to
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
do with Medicare that's a separate
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's a separate federal law and so if
 
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
I can follow up that if there was a that
 
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
I would there's no exemption in here for
 
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
these cash Pay Direct pay or membership
 
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals no there's no exemption for
 
01:53:51.729 --> 01:53:51.739 align:start position:0%
them to that requirement is there
 
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that would work I don't
 
01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:55.729 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that would work I don't
know

01:53:55.729 --> 01:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
but you don't see an exemption thank you
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't understand how that
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
would all work
 
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:54:04.729 --> 01:54:04.739 align:start position:0%
representative navel thank you Mr
 
01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:06.179 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks again
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
um this is going to sound like a stupid
 
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
question but it's not so if I show up in
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
your hospital and I say I want to pay
 
01:54:16.729 --> 01:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
cash would you turn me away no and as a
 
01:54:18.169 --> 01:54:18.179 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that question would you
 
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
charge me a different rate than I would
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
if I was paying Insurance
 
01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
um charges are charges
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
um and what's reimbursed is different
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
depending on what coverage you have but
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
I think the um one issue
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
does come up because we do have many um
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is complicated
 
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
um so if you have insurance whether it's
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
a ten thousand dollar deductible or
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
um a two thousand dollar or no
 
01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.129 align:start position:0%
um a two thousand dollar or no
deductible

01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:49.139 align:start position:0%
deductible
 
01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
um you if you have insurance you're not
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually eligible for a self-paid
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
discount which the hospitals not all
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
providers in the state must adhere to
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
this but the hospitals do and it's also
 
01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
part of the ACA that they must
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
um if you are self-pay you are you are
 
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
offered a discount but if you have
 
01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
insurance even though it's a ten
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar deductible you do have
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
insurance and I think that was to
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
represent a Merchant's earlier point you
 
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
are not considered uninsured you're
 
01:55:22.030 --> 01:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
considered you may consider yourself
 
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
underinsured but you are insured so if
 
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
you were to just pay cash but have
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
insurance I just wanted to qualify
 
01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
because this comes up
 
01:55:33.229 --> 01:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
um honestly this does come up we have a
 
01:55:36.609 --> 01:55:36.619 align:start position:0%
state law and a federal law relative to
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
self-pay discount answer charity what
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
you can offer if you don't have any
 
01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
insurance that is not the case if you
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
just choose to pay out of pocket you
 
01:55:49.970 --> 01:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
I hope that makes sense thank you other
 
01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:51.609 align:start position:0%
I hope that makes sense thank you other
questions

01:55:51.609 --> 01:55:51.619 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:55:53.689 --> 01:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:55:56.689 --> 01:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:55:56.699 --> 01:55:57.290 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:59.689 --> 01:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
I'll be blunt I'm not a fan of the
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
current system I know that many people
 
01:56:05.050 --> 01:56:05.060 align:start position:0%
are not satisfied with the hospital care
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
we have the long wait times I think that
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
things like limiting beds to keep
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
critical access Hospital status are
 
01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
things that contribute to that to
 
01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
decrease patient satisfaction and put
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
patients in danger sometimes and I'm
 
01:56:21.410 --> 01:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
just wondering hypothetically since we
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
were dealing with hypotheticals a minute
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
ago hypothetically if you know the we
 
01:56:28.970 --> 01:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
passed this bill and we have direct
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
payment hospitals prop up and they start
 
01:56:34.129 --> 01:56:34.139 align:start position:0%
to take some of the clients from the
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and hypothetically if they they're
 
01:56:41.209 --> 01:56:41.219 align:start position:0%
still required to have these payment
 
01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
plans so you know I I see
 
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
I see lower income people being drawn to
 
01:56:50.689 --> 01:56:50.699 align:start position:0%
that because they have the payment plan
 
01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:55.139 align:start position:0%
options and and lower prices for
 
01:56:55.139 --> 01:56:57.050 align:start position:0%
options and and lower prices for
services

01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:56:59.930 --> 01:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
um is it such a bad thing if a new
 
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
system that was more satisfying to
 
01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
patients and decreased wait times and
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
decreased costs is it such a bad thing
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
if you know the system changes
 
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:14.689 align:start position:0%
if you know the system changes
foreign

01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot in there
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
um critical access hospitals and the
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
reason that they converted to to
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
critical access Hospital status
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
um are are kind of complicated but one
 
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
of the um they are paid differently than
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
a larger facility so they have to
 
01:57:34.199 --> 01:57:36.229 align:start position:0%
a larger facility so they have to
maintain

01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
um all sorts of services and their cost
 
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
is their costs are reflective of that
 
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
hence why the Congress believes that
 
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
having our critical access hospitals be
 
01:57:51.729 --> 01:57:51.739 align:start position:0%
stable was a very important
 
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
federal policy back in the um in the in
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
early 2000s when they when they passed
 
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
that law so anything to disrupt that
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
would be again as rep as representative
 
01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
Palmer indicated the hospitals are
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
actually in dire Financial condition
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
right now and um and they the critical
 
01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
including the critical access hospitals
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
so disrupting that so you would um I
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
guess the hype the hype um the
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
hypothetical is really bringing in new
 
01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
entrants into the market
 
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
um and disrupting the current health
 
01:58:27.649 --> 01:58:27.659 align:start position:0%
care System
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
um I do
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
um kind of take offense to indicating
 
01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:34.139 align:start position:0%
that long wait times equates to low
 
01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:37.340 align:start position:0%
quality of care I think our hospitals
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
experience with their patients is would
 
01:58:43.129 --> 01:58:43.139 align:start position:0%
show otherwise but besides that it is
 
01:58:44.990 --> 01:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
really important to maintain the current
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
health care system that we have and all
 
01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:50.219 align:start position:0%
we're saying is just play by the rules
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
if you want to come in you get a license
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
like everyone else and you take you take
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
all comers and including charity care
 
01:59:00.169 --> 01:59:00.179 align:start position:0%
and certainly if you want to set up a
 
01:59:02.089 --> 01:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
payment plan that's great hospitals do
 
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
it all the time
 
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
and so again just play by the rules and
 
01:59:08.209 --> 01:59:08.219 align:start position:0%
then you could be part of the Health
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
Care system that has been here for in
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
some cases hundreds of years
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you chairman
 
01:59:17.689 --> 01:59:17.699 align:start position:0%
McDonald and thank you for taking yet
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
another one of my questions
 
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning of your testimony
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
I believe you said everybody loves our
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
critical access care hospitals but would
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
you believe that there are many who
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
actually do not and would you believe
 
01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
that there are many who are so unhappy
 
01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
with previous care that family members
 
01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
and friends have received that they will
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
actually drive hours further greater
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
distance out of their way to go to a
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
different hospital other than the one
 
01:59:47.209 --> 01:59:47.219 align:start position:0%
that they live nearby because they're so
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
unhappy with the critical access care
 
01:59:52.729 --> 01:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
hospital that they live near thank you
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know that that
 
01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
um requires an answer
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
um I as legislators if you have concerns
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
about hospitals or you're hearing from
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
constituents that's what we're here you
 
02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
should go talk to the CEO of the
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
hospital you should come talk to me um
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
and we can address those concerns the as
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
I have explained before the hospitals
 
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
are in crisis right now and there is a
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage as I think you're
 
02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
well aware throughout the entire system
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
not not just Health Care System the
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
entire economy right now is in crisis
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
relative to getting Workforce so that is
 
02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest issues that we're
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with right now but the hospitals
 
02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
are committed to taking care of all
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
patients that they can and unfortunately
 
02:00:41.810 --> 02:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
yes very very long wait times I was at a
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
hospital Ed the other night on as a as a
 
02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
guest not as a patient and the wait
 
02:00:50.410 --> 02:00:50.420 align:start position:0%
times are extraordinary extraordinary
 
02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
but you know what they take every every
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
single one that comes in doesn't matter
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
if they can pay or not and there they
 
02:00:58.490 --> 02:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
are they are taking care of those
 
02:01:01.490 --> 02:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
patients for every single minute of
 
02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
every single day so that's what I'm
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
proud of I'm proud of our hospitals that
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
are taking care of patients if you have
 
02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
a problem and your constituent has a
 
02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
problem I encourage you to come talk
 
02:01:12.530 --> 02:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
with me and we can certainly address it
 
02:01:15.410 --> 02:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
through the hospital but I don't I I
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
will not I don't know that I have
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
anything else to say thank you
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
alternative Leon
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
Miss Monahan for everything you do in
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
order to provide the best care that you
 
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
can to the people of New Hampshire and
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
everybody that you work with I
 
02:01:31.609 --> 02:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
appreciate how the system's in crisis
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm actually curious if it's the if
 
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's the unpaid care or if it's the ex
 
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
the increase in in Medicare and Medicaid
 
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
care that's paid below the sustainable
 
02:01:44.450 --> 02:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
rates which of those do you think is
 
02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
driving the hospitals further into
 
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:48.300 align:start position:0%
crisis those that are under the CMS
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
systems or those who are coming in
 
02:01:52.609 --> 02:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
without any any coverage at all it is
 
02:01:56.570 --> 02:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
just it is just the demand is just
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
extraordinary right now that is really
 
02:02:01.129 --> 02:02:01.139 align:start position:0%
the issue and they are just struggling
 
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
because of um again Workforce shortages
 
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
so the entire system it's not has
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with a particular payer
 
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Ms
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
Bennett for taking my question we talked
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
about the patient access but could you
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
speak to maybe you know but speak to the
 
02:02:23.209 --> 02:02:23.219 align:start position:0%
fact that in many
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
towns in which a critical access
 
02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
hospital is located
 
02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
it's a primary economic driver for that
 
02:02:30.290 --> 02:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
community so losing it is not just
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
losing patient access we're losing the
 
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
possibility of sustaining the community
 
02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:36.179 align:start position:0%
economically as well yes
 
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
I acknowledge that we have another fact
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
sheet that I should give you relative to
 
02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.109 align:start position:0%
sheet that I should give you relative to
um

02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:44.089 --> 02:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
to the uh actually it's part of the fact
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
sheet that I gave you but I have more
 
02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
information that I'm happy to share with
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
folks because yes hospitals and health
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
care in general are huge economic
 
02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
drivers and definitely the hospitals are
 
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes the largest employers in a
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
given community
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no other questions thank you
 
02:03:10.729 --> 02:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Greg Moore
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Moore if you can have
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
hold it for three minutes or so I I
 
02:03:26.209 --> 02:03:26.219 align:start position:0%
shall thank you Mr chairman members of
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thank you the
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak here today for the
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
record my name is Greg Moore I am the
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
state director with Americans for
 
02:03:32.649 --> 02:03:32.659 align:start position:0%
Prosperity here in New Hampshire
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of house bill 69.
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we believe that that this
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
is good legislation however I'll be
 
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
candid we would prefer bigger Bolder
 
02:03:45.169 --> 02:03:45.179 align:start position:0%
reforms in terms of deregulating the the
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
health care facility space but we think
 
02:03:48.890 --> 02:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
this is a good first step
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we think this
 
02:03:52.729 --> 02:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
isn't a huge step is because there
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
aren't any facilities that take direct
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
pay right now in New Hampshire
 
02:03:59.810 --> 02:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
and the law that is being adjusted by
 
02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 69 wasn't passed until 2016.
 
02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:05.219 align:start position:0%
so we made it all the way through 2016
 
02:04:07.370 --> 02:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
without any health care direct pay
 
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
health care facilities uh taking place
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so that's that that's
 
02:04:13.609 --> 02:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason why I believe
 
02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
this is not going to have a huge
 
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
transformative impact as much as frankly
 
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
we would like that however we do support
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation because we believe that
 
02:04:24.530 --> 02:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
it provides more options to Consumers
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
more to that to Health Care consumers
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire who
 
02:04:30.169 --> 02:04:30.179 align:start position:0%
need more options right now New
 
02:04:31.609 --> 02:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the highest use of high
 
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
deductible health plans in in the
 
02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:33.950 align:start position:0%
deductible health plans in in the
country

02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
and those those deductibles are among
 
02:04:37.490 --> 02:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
the highest in the country as well for
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
for family plan they are the highest so
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens your constituents
 
02:04:43.490 --> 02:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
are paying through the nose for health
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
care right now and that's fundamentally
 
02:04:47.689 --> 02:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
is creating creating the potential for
 
02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
for for the value for the uh facilities
 
02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
that might take direct pay the other
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
piece is that starting in 2019 when you
 
02:04:57.530 --> 02:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
passed the direct Primary Care law there
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
are people who are becoming more
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea of paying for
 
02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
their health care costs themselves as
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to going through a third party
 
02:05:05.639 --> 02:05:06.770 align:start position:0%
opposed to going through a third party
payer

02:05:06.770 --> 02:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
payer
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
third-party payers add a huge overhead
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
to the system and there was some I've
 
02:05:13.970 --> 02:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
seen some studies that show anywhere
 
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
between uh 35 and 60 of the health care
 
02:05:19.729 --> 02:05:19.739 align:start position:0%
costs are due to a lot of this overhead
 
02:05:22.270 --> 02:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
one example I saw is that there was a
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
National Association for independent
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
Physicians and they made a
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation that for every physician
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
they should have two people doing
 
02:05:30.599 --> 02:05:31.609 align:start position:0%
they should have two people doing
billing

02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
billing
 
02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
now that's obviously going to add a ton
 
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
a ton of overhead and moreover it
 
02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
creates a barrier between between the
 
02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
the doctor and the patient and while we
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the concerns of of
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
the hospitals who undoubtedly don't just
 
02:05:48.410 --> 02:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
like every other business they don't
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
want any more competition if they could
 
02:05:53.570 --> 02:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
avoid it but uh but the the focus for us
 
02:05:55.729 --> 02:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
is on getting more options to the
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
patients again I don't I don't foresee a
 
02:06:01.550 --> 02:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
major a major facility being built I
 
02:06:04.129 --> 02:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
think there's almost no chance of a an
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
actual Hospital there is another
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
provision in the law that created this
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
all-payer provision in 2016 that
 
02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
requires anyone who's seeking hospital
 
02:06:13.970 --> 02:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
license to have a 24 7 emergency
 
02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
department unless of course they were
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
they had their Hospital license before
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
2016 in which case they don't need to
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
have a 24 7 emergency department so I
 
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
don't foresee anyone that's that's going
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
to take a hospital license and that
 
02:06:27.649 --> 02:06:27.659 align:start position:0%
hospital license is for anyone who's
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
going to have a patient stay overnight
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna have a patient to stay
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
overnight is it possible we could see an
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgical Care Center
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
potentially but I think that the chances
 
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
of that are still pretty small but we
 
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
think it's a good positive step in the
 
02:06:42.050 --> 02:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
right direction and I'd be happy to take
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee okay
 
02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative Murphy
 
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question you you just
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned given patients uh I'm all for
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
options but you're talking about giving
 
02:06:55.390 --> 02:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
patients more options are you talking
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
specifically and only
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
a payment option versus the option of
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
having a facility that you stand up and
 
02:07:05.689 --> 02:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
has services available that cover the
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of services that the
 
02:07:10.070 --> 02:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
patients need not just the ones that are
 
02:07:12.169 --> 02:07:12.179 align:start position:0%
high revenues like a surgical center or
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
an MRI unit but all the services that a
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
um a patient and family might need
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:07:22.729 --> 02:07:22.739 align:start position:0%
um I I'd point to you what happened in
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
2016 the biggest impact the legislation
 
02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
that is would be changed by this uh
 
02:07:31.250 --> 02:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
relates back to legislation Senate Bill
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
481 from 2016. and the biggest change
 
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's come out of the healthcare
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
landscape now that bill was put in place
 
02:07:41.450 --> 02:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
because the certificate of need board
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
was being repealed so we no longer have
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
a certificate of need board
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
and the biggest change that we've seen
 
02:07:48.890 --> 02:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
that we've seen a proliferation of
 
02:07:50.689 --> 02:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
urgent care centers across across the
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
state now I have no doubt that that
 
02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
probably has some impact on the overall
 
02:07:55.970 --> 02:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
Workforce and maybe creating some of the
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
workforce challenges but we don't know
 
02:08:00.169 --> 02:08:00.179 align:start position:0%
where Innovation will go when we start
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
changing policies every industry when
 
02:08:04.370 --> 02:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's when as soon as it gets deregulated
 
02:08:06.129 --> 02:08:06.139 align:start position:0%
we start to see Innovation take place
 
02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
and uh those Innovations provide an
 
02:08:11.089 --> 02:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Change and for more
 
02:08:13.609 --> 02:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
growth and more new opportunities so
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
whether whether Health Care comes in one
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
one big box or is broken up into a bunch
 
02:08:21.229 --> 02:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
of tiny little boxes we think it's best
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
for for to have the opportunity to
 
02:08:24.890 --> 02:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
explore those opportunities for
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
Innovation because we think that those
 
02:08:28.250 --> 02:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
opportunities for Innovation invariably
 
02:08:30.410 --> 02:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
will provide greater greater choice for
 
02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
for consumers and and likely a greater
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
competition for health care you know for
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
health care services which will drive
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
prices down thank you and I see a hand
 
02:08:45.169 --> 02:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
over here yeah a representative profile
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:08:49.729 --> 02:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
Moore for taking my question so you
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
indicated that the the the language the
 
02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
current language in the bill that
 
02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:54.770 align:start position:0%
current language in the bill that
specifies

02:08:54.770 --> 02:08:54.780 align:start position:0%
specifies
 
02:08:57.290 --> 02:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
um licensed Healthcare facilities have
 
02:09:00.669 --> 02:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
to accept all forms of payment dates to
 
02:09:04.070 --> 02:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
2016. can you speak to the
 
02:09:05.810 --> 02:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
sort of the the
 
02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
landscape for critical care hospitals
 
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
before that and after that and if
 
02:09:16.070 --> 02:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
possible speak to
 
02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
um what is that what we've seen in other
 
02:09:20.089 --> 02:09:20.099 align:start position:0%
states with with respect to critical
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
care hospitals uh certainly uh think of
 
02:09:25.129 --> 02:09:25.139 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:09:27.709 --> 02:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
you know we worked on this issue closely
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
when the chairman and I happened to work
 
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
together over at DHHS
 
02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
um it was it was a big issue with
 
02:09:35.570 --> 02:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
working through the critical uh the
 
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals
 
02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:38.209 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals
um

02:09:38.209 --> 02:09:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you I'll tell you that
 
02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
that when you look at the I think you're
 
02:09:43.729 --> 02:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
talking about you said Critical Care did
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
you mean critical access hospitals
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:53.330 --> 02:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
the report that that uh I know Jared
 
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
Rhodes spoke about his report but if you
 
02:09:56.810 --> 02:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
look at his report one of the things it
 
02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
does is it actually shows a map
 
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
and each critical access Hospital under
 
02:10:03.770 --> 02:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
the law Senate Bill 481 same senate
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill that that is currently in
 
02:10:08.450 --> 02:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
fact uh each critical access hospital
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
has a 15-mile radius around which
 
02:10:13.250 --> 02:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
frankly it would be nearly impossible to
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
build a health care facility without
 
02:10:16.070 --> 02:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
without the support of the actual
 
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
critical access hospital now consider
 
02:10:21.770 --> 02:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
that 15 miles 15 mile radius is about
 
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
700 square miles
 
02:10:26.089 --> 02:10:26.099 align:start position:0%
and when you lump all those
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
together what you end up with the map
 
02:10:30.169 --> 02:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
and there is a map I encourage people to
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
look at it in the report it shows that
 
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
basically the only place where this
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
could have any effect this log is the
 
02:10:39.050 --> 02:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
southeast portion of the state because
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
those those
 
02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
critical access Hospital zones bump into
 
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
each other all across the northern
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
Central and western parts of the state
 
02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
so so that I think it'd be really a
 
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
challenge to to even find any of these
 
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
these things now as far as the overall
 
02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
stability and the health of critical
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
access hospitals nationally uh since the
 
02:11:02.810 --> 02:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
passage of the uh the the ACA the
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act uh hundreds of these
 
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
have gone out of business now I don't
 
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
know if that's relates to Simply Market
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
forces that work across the country that
 
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
they were headed that direction anyway
 
02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
but since since people started tracking
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
it since it passes now in New Hampshire
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
we have not had any despite the fact
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
that nationally there's a trend for its
 
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals to close in
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire none of the 13 critical
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
access hospitals which were there when I
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
was at HHS they're all still there we
 
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a new and frankly I think
 
02:11:34.129 --> 02:11:34.139 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things to consider about
 
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
the overall Healthcare landscape is that
 
02:11:39.649 --> 02:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
we have not built a new hospital in New
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since 1983 three
 
02:11:43.370 --> 02:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
not built a new hospital in New
 
02:11:46.129 --> 02:11:46.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since 1983 and that was uh in
 
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
the vice chairs town uh and it's been
 
02:11:50.689 --> 02:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
quite a while that our population has
 
02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.099 align:start position:0%
grown by 50 but we haven't built a new a
 
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
new hospital
 
02:11:57.169 --> 02:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
02:11:59.689 --> 02:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
yes you mentioned thank you Mr chairman
 
02:12:03.410 --> 02:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned the uh these most
 
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
likely emerging these
 
02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:06.649 align:start position:0%
likely emerging these
um

02:12:06.649 --> 02:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
like most likely emerging in the in the
 
02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
lower tier of the state can you speak to
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
whether you see that as potentially a
 
02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
draw for patients coming from nearby
 
02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
States and whether that is an economic
 
02:12:21.649 --> 02:12:21.659 align:start position:0%
Boom for your whether it draws economic
 
02:12:24.109 --> 02:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
activity I would say to
 
02:12:26.209 --> 02:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
um to New Hampshire
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
certainly uh certainly
 
02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
other states around us have very
 
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
restrictive regulatory policies
 
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
regarding uh regarding the facilities
 
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
licensing most of them still have
 
02:12:39.890 --> 02:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
certificate of need boards that we
 
02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:44.099 align:start position:0%
repealed in 2016. the uh and and so
 
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's always the opportunity for if we
 
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
have a new a new model that's working
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
well and maybe offering things at a
 
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
price point that they can't get in their
 
02:12:53.450 --> 02:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
home state that they would come to New
 
02:12:56.030 --> 02:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from somewhere else to decide
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
to get that care
 
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative Shapiro
 
02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:04.729 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
Moore

02:13:04.729 --> 02:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
Moore
 
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
um we've received a lot of assurances
 
02:13:09.649 --> 02:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
that this would be a very a small uptake
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
and that it wouldn't really affect
 
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
um hospitals although I appreciate your
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
bluntness when you said you would like
 
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
it to be bolder and you'd like it to
 
02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:19.490 align:start position:0%
it to be bolder and you'd like it to
um

02:13:19.490 --> 02:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
to Blossom and get bigger
 
02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
to what extent would organizations like
 
02:13:28.079 --> 02:13:29.109 align:start position:0%
to what extent would organizations like
yours

02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
yours
 
02:13:33.069 --> 02:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
play a part in promoting these
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
institutions where they to come into
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
being to to actually be to what extent
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
would political organizations play a
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
part in marketing these um
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
I hadn't considered the question thank
 
02:13:51.169 --> 02:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
you for the question I hadn't considered
 
02:13:53.569 --> 02:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
that uh I don't think that we would I
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
don't think there's too much of a first
 
02:13:56.510 --> 02:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
of all
 
02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
and I think you're you're
 
02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
talking maybe about some of the uptake
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
on the on the EFA uh
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
but there's no Market at this point you
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
you can't Market to something that
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist it would be my initial
 
02:14:10.669 --> 02:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
take is that that there are no of these
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
none of these facilities so you can't
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
say go to this facility that doesn't
 
02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
say go to this facility that doesn't
exist

02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
exist
 
02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up I'm talking about if
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation passed and they
 
02:14:26.270 --> 02:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is so personal uh that
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
doctor-patient relationship is so
 
02:14:32.209 --> 02:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
critical I I don't think there's a space
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
um I think that that what would drive it
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
more than anything is the transparency
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
and the pricing
 
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon uh thank
 
02:14:45.530 --> 02:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for being
 
02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
here or hearing all sorts of issues
 
02:14:49.490 --> 02:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
about the workforce shortage but we
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to hear about it because we
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
know it's real
 
02:14:55.089 --> 02:14:55.099 align:start position:0%
um by having one of these facilities
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
that would allow a doctor to choose how
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
they they practice like it used to be
 
02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
like when many doctors went to medical
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
school as opposed to the more employee
 
02:15:06.109 --> 02:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
relationship that a lot of doctors now
 
02:15:07.970 --> 02:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
experience do you think that that would
 
02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
help retain doctors that are later in
 
02:15:13.129 --> 02:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
their career maybe attract others who
 
02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
are dissuaded by the employee version of
 
02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
a medicine and do you think that it
 
02:15:19.729 --> 02:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
could help retain people that object to
 
02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
some of the CMS requirements
 
02:15:25.069 --> 02:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh I would I
 
02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
would say that I've had a chance to talk
 
02:15:28.490 --> 02:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
with some of the direct primary care
 
02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
doctors people who are offering direct
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
Primary Care
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
and they will and of course all of them
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
came out of the the old system that or
 
02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
the employee system as you described and
 
02:15:41.149 --> 02:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
I they they are uniformly uniformly
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
thrilled to be away from that uniformly
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
thrilled to be away from that might that
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
cause some to either stay in the area or
 
02:15:51.649 --> 02:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
or have the opportunity to uh practice
 
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
longer I think there's certainly a
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
possibility but but I will say that the
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
satisfaction from these doctors who are
 
02:16:00.649 --> 02:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
offering direct Primary Care is is high
 
02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I know that I know that uh the the
 
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
saint anselves paper I did a
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
satisfaction survey and they reached out
 
02:16:08.930 --> 02:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
to these direct primary care doctors and
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
I and I think that the data are in the
 
02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.589 align:start position:0%
I and I think that the data are in the
report

02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:16:15.709 --> 02:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Seth King
 
02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald uh
 
02:16:19.129 --> 02:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and I think a lot
 
02:16:20.569 --> 02:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
alike because I was going to ask the
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
exact same question except I was going
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
to ask about nurses my understanding is
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of nurses that have
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
recently left the workforce a lot of
 
02:16:30.890 --> 02:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
them are very unhappy with working
 
02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
within the Legacy system do you think
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
that you could bring back nurses to the
 
02:16:38.750 --> 02:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
workforce if there was an alternative
 
02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
system as well thank you thanks for the
 
02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
question uh I'll just say that I'll just
 
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
I interviewed somebody for a position
 
02:16:49.490 --> 02:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
with our organized with our organization
 
02:16:52.849 --> 02:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
who came out of the nursing field and
 
02:16:55.370 --> 02:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
she's she left the practice of nursing
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh because of the frustrations with the
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
existing system and that was an
 
02:17:00.410 --> 02:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
interview I had yesterday so it's fresh
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
02:17:05.089 --> 02:17:05.099 align:start position:0%
um and here I was thinking man we need
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
you in nursing but that's their choice
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's their their choice and and if we
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
have a system that that's taking these
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
highly skilled professionals out of the
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
out of the system I think it's I think
 
02:17:17.810 --> 02:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's obviously bad now there are other
 
02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
options for some nursing there's there's
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
some private duty nursing there's some
 
02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
other options that can't exist other
 
02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
than being jammed into the Legacy system
 
02:17:28.429 --> 02:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
uh but I think that again creating more
 
02:17:30.169 --> 02:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
opportunity just again this type of
 
02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
innovation we don't know what would
 
02:17:34.310 --> 02:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
happen should uh should should this
 
02:17:37.490 --> 02:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
should we have the system start and
 
02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:38.209 align:start position:0%
should we have the system start and
again

02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:17:40.129 --> 02:17:40.139 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't think there's
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
going to be unless we see the direct
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
direct I think the direct primary
 
02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:45.589 align:start position:0%
direct I think the direct primary
facility

02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
growth would track alongside direct
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
Primary Care growth I think that's the
 
02:17:53.570 --> 02:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
two have to ride hand in hand and uh
 
02:17:56.929 --> 02:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
keep in mind I will I will add one thing
 
02:17:56.939 --> 02:17:58.310 align:start position:0%
keep in mind I will I will add one thing
uh

02:17:58.310 --> 02:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:02.209 --> 02:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
when we pass this law in in 2016
 
02:18:04.129 --> 02:18:04.139 align:start position:0%
. uh one of the real focus of putting
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
the all-payer provision in
 
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
and I guess I have to back up to 2011.
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
2011 uh in 2011 and I think maybe
 
02:18:12.410 --> 02:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative McKay was the only one
 
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
around for that uh there was a bill to
 
02:18:17.690 --> 02:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
Simply outright repeal the con board and
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
pass the house and then went to the
 
02:18:20.209 --> 02:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
Senate and they said okay let's give it
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
three years and so it was going to be in
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
2014 and then in the budget in 2013 they
 
02:18:25.370 --> 02:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
said let's kick it out another two years
 
02:18:29.530 --> 02:18:29.540 align:start position:0%
so it went to 20 to 2016. and ultimately
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh uh one of the provisions
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
of of uh that the basis for the 2011 law
 
02:18:41.330 --> 02:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh was that some folks wanted to invite
 
02:18:43.849 --> 02:18:43.859 align:start position:0%
a cancer treatment facility into into
 
02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who said that they would
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire if the state got
 
02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
rid of its certificate uh certificate of
 
02:18:49.370 --> 02:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
need law
 
02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
and that that Pro that hospital did not
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
take all payers
 
02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
they did not take all payers and I
 
02:18:58.849 --> 02:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
suspect that that some of the provisions
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
you see are based upon and frankly if
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
you went and looked up the Senate
 
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
testimony from Senate Bill uh 481 you
 
02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
actually saw oncologists coming in
 
02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
saying we need essentially saying we
 
02:19:11.330 --> 02:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
need to keep Cancer Treatment Centers of
 
02:19:13.969 --> 02:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
America out of New Hampshire so I
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
suspect that's that's some of the basis
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
of of uh why that law went into effect
 
02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
but it's also important remember that in
 
02:19:22.250 --> 02:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
2016 we were under a very different
 
02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:23.870 align:start position:0%
2016 we were under a very different
landscape

02:19:23.870 --> 02:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:25.870 align:start position:0%
landscape
um

02:19:25.870 --> 02:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
right okay if you could
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cushman
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
02:19:41.089 --> 02:19:41.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
um can you speak a little bit
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so I could pay about 600 700 a month
 
02:19:51.650 --> 02:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
and receive primary care and instead I
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
pay 250 for my entire family and all of
 
02:19:56.450 --> 02:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
our Primary Care is covered and they
 
02:19:58.490 --> 02:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
have group buy-in for lab so the labs
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
are really cheap and I don't have any
 
02:20:03.469 --> 02:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
co-pays can you speak to what the cost
 
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
savings may look like for a person who
 
02:20:09.469 --> 02:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
chooses to utilize services at a direct
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
payment facility
 
02:20:14.929 --> 02:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
I I'd ref reference what Mr Rhodes said
 
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
earlier uh speaking he's spent a lot
 
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
more time looking at this longitudinally
 
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
than I have
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
um I think if you look at if you look at
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
the he references the surgery center of
 
02:20:25.439 --> 02:20:26.810 align:start position:0%
the he references the surgery center of
Oklahoma

02:20:26.810 --> 02:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
and talking about prices pricing being
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh 50 or less of what they get in a
 
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
facility that has to go through the
 
02:20:37.969 --> 02:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
tradition more traditional
 
02:20:40.429 --> 02:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
um more traditional payment methods so
 
02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh he'd probably be a better reference
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
than I okay other questions
 
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.550 align:start position:0%
than I okay other questions
name

02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
name
 
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions
 
02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
oh representative Nagel okay thank you
 
02:20:53.330 --> 02:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um thanks for taking my
 
02:20:54.830 --> 02:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious are you
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Laser Spine Center of
 
02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.309 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Laser Spine Center of
Florida

02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
02:21:00.370 --> 02:21:00.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I'm not familiar with it
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
thanks they pretty much operate on under
 
02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
the model you talked about
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
um their prices were extravagant and
 
02:21:10.010 --> 02:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
eventually they went out of business for
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
legal reasons but what are the one of
 
02:21:14.570 --> 02:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
the interesting things about direct pay
 
02:21:17.690 --> 02:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
is that if you look squarely at if you
 
02:21:19.730 --> 02:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
look squarely at Lasix which is a
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
procedure that's not covered by
 
02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:23.030 align:start position:0%
procedure that's not covered by
insurance

02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:27.740 align:start position:0%
um the Lasix procedure has both improved
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
qualitatively as you'd expect the
 
02:21:31.250 --> 02:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
petitioners do it more often they're
 
02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
going to get better at it but also the
 
02:21:36.889 --> 02:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
pricing has has dropped dramatically and
 
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
part of the thought on that is that
 
02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:40.070 align:start position:0%
part of the thought on that is that
because

02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
it is not covered by insurance and it is
 
02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
a competitive environment that we've
 
02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
seen the prices really drop so I'm not
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
familiar about the specifics I don't
 
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
know if lace if Lasix is what they were
 
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
offering in Florida
 
02:21:55.130 --> 02:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
oh they even use lasers yeah just name
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
just call themselves laser okay it's
 
02:22:00.530 --> 02:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
good marketing other questions
 
02:22:04.670 --> 02:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
and the last person signed up to testify
 
02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:11.030 align:start position:0%
and the last person signed up to testify
um

02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you Mr
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee
 
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
my name is Alex katrubis I'm here to
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
represent long-term care facilities both
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
for-profit and non-profit
 
02:22:31.849 --> 02:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
nursing homes private nursing homes and
 
02:22:34.969 --> 02:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to house bill 69.
 
02:22:37.130 --> 02:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
as you've heard right now in New
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do not have a certificate
 
02:22:40.910 --> 02:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
of need process we do not have a
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
certificate of need process in the
 
02:22:43.790 --> 02:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
nursing home World either but we do have
 
02:22:46.969 --> 02:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
a bed moratorium which the nursing home
 
02:22:49.130 --> 02:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
strongly support and we support it
 
02:22:50.929 --> 02:22:50.939 align:start position:0%
because our Health Care system is
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
interconnected and considerable taxpayer
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
dollars are involved if the balance
 
02:23:00.170 --> 02:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
of Care Resources is upset then the
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences could be
 
02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:02.990 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences could be
disastrous

02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
disastrous
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
the language of House Bill 69 may sound
 
02:23:09.410 --> 02:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
unobjectionable to the layperson simply
 
02:23:10.969 --> 02:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
exempting the requirement that a
 
02:23:12.889 --> 02:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
facility provided services to all
 
02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
persons who require the services the
 
02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
facility provides regardless of the
 
02:23:18.770 --> 02:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
source of payment for the services
 
02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
provided to any person any facility
 
02:23:24.650 --> 02:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
that is on a membership basis business
 
02:23:27.530 --> 02:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
model or exclusively provide services to
 
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
a person
 
02:23:30.889 --> 02:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
who make direct payment for services now
 
02:23:32.570 --> 02:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
that's directly from the bill so what's
 
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
the harm you may ask is this not a free
 
02:23:37.490 --> 02:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
market operation yet those questions
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
ignore the interconnectedness of our
 
02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:40.790 align:start position:0%
ignore the interconnectedness of our
system

02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
if a particular facility can cherry pick
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
those who are private paying and ignore
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
all others the burden will fall more
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
heavily upon taxpayers or the insured to
 
02:23:54.050 --> 02:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
subsidize those facilities that do not
 
02:23:56.450 --> 02:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
contract to those served by Medicaid
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare or private insurance
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
if this bill would be applied to nursing
 
02:24:03.650 --> 02:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
homes for example private Medicaid
 
02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
Contracting facilities would collapse
 
02:24:09.050 --> 02:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
flooding the County nursing homes
 
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
and you as representatives of your
 
02:24:13.070 --> 02:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
county delegation would have to foot the
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill for that
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
in signing the emergency medical
 
02:24:20.210 --> 02:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
treatment and Labor Act law in 1986 no
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
less a champion of the free market than
 
02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
President Ronald Reagan recognized that
 
02:24:27.290 --> 02:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities providers have a
 
02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
societal obligation prior to that point
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
a hospital could turn away even a dying
 
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
person unable to pay for his or her care
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
resulting in some facilities dumping
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
patients upon those facilities committed
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
to serving all in need
 
02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
but it would appear that house bill 69
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
would close the emergency room doors
 
02:24:48.650 --> 02:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
that Reagan opened at least where a
 
02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
facility is membership based or only
 
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
accepting direct payment for services so
 
02:24:55.130 --> 02:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
with that I have some other things I
 
02:24:56.570 --> 02:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
could say but there's a lot of folks
 
02:24:58.370 --> 02:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
behind me who are from the public who
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
want to speak on these other bills so
 
02:25:02.210 --> 02:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
with that Mr chairman I will submit the
 
02:25:04.730 --> 02:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
written testimony and suspend okay thank
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
you very much you're welcome
 
02:25:07.309 --> 02:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:25:09.770 --> 02:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
just a very brief clarification because
 
02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
I thought at one point I heard somebody
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
else say that this bill would not cover
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes that is correct it
 
02:25:20.090 --> 02:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
would not I read it as it would not
 
02:25:21.770 --> 02:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
cover the nursing homes however you all
 
02:25:23.570 --> 02:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
you heard the previous speaker talk
 
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
about how this is only the beginning and
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know it could be the camel's nose
 
02:25:30.050 --> 02:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
Under the Tent a slippery slope whatever
 
02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
you want to call it but as it stands
 
02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
right now it would not impact the nurse
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
so could I could I follow up so you're
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
just concerned about what the next step
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
is you're not concerned about the
 
02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
effects of this bill we are we are we
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
agree with the hospital Association we
 
02:25:47.690 --> 02:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
serve folks on Medicaid all of the
 
02:25:49.610 --> 02:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
private nursing homes to take Medicaid
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
patients and and we care about
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
folks that don't have resources who may
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
need care so we stand in solidarity with
 
02:25:58.490 --> 02:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals but it does not
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
directly impact nursing homes thank you
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
02:26:07.010 --> 02:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
last session we heard uh we heard some
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
bills on direct pay in nursing homes and
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
long-term care however we were told that
 
02:26:15.050 --> 02:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
that already is available that there is
 
02:26:17.210 --> 02:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
no all payers requirement and I was just
 
02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:18.410 align:start position:0%
no all payers requirement and I was just
curious

02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
curious
 
02:26:19.730 --> 02:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
um I was just curious if we were
 
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
misinformed last year
 
02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand your question
 
02:26:26.809 --> 02:26:26.819 align:start position:0%
my question is it's my understanding
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
that nursing homes and long-term care
 
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
are not required to take all payers so
 
02:26:34.330 --> 02:26:34.340 align:start position:0%
therefore they already have this freedom
 
02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
that that that is true but all 99 of the
 
02:26:41.570 --> 02:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
nursing homes take Medicaid
 
02:26:43.610 --> 02:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have to have a
 
02:26:45.650 --> 02:26:45.660 align:start position:0%
balanced system where we have private
 
02:26:47.450 --> 02:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
pay we have people who have long-term
 
02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
care insurance we have some people who
 
02:26:52.849 --> 02:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
pay out of pocket uh we we need all of
 
02:26:55.550 --> 02:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
the the different sources of revenue for
 
02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
reimbursement into the mix if we don't
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
have that it's going to fall on the
 
02:27:02.090 --> 02:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to foot the bill thank you
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay saying none
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to testify
 
02:27:19.309 --> 02:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
on HP 69 does anyone else wish to
 
02:27:19.319 --> 02:27:21.010 align:start position:0%
on HP 69 does anyone else wish to
testify

02:27:21.010 --> 02:27:21.020 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:27:23.210 --> 02:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I am closing the public
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb69
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we are returning to the public
 
02:27:35.809 --> 02:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 308 608 I'm sorry
 
02:27:37.550 --> 02:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
um also um
 
02:27:39.410 --> 02:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
I know we've got we're going to go
 
02:27:40.969 --> 02:27:40.979 align:start position:0%
through all the pink cards uh and
 
02:27:42.889 --> 02:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
everyone will be um is welcome to
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
testify uh but we do want to point out
 
02:27:47.210 --> 02:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
that we're also going to have a work
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
session on this bill on March 8th and uh
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's a obviously an important issue
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of interest and because
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
you filled out a pink card today you
 
02:27:57.650 --> 02:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to testify today
 
02:28:00.050 --> 02:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
you'll have that opportunity on March
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
8th also
 
02:28:02.690 --> 02:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
um there was a lady here earlier from
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
one sky and I I would welcome her back
 
02:28:09.050 --> 02:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
if she's still here and again I my
 
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
apologies for the earlier confusion
 
02:28:14.450 --> 02:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald my name is
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
Janan Archibald I am a legislative
 
02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
liaison from one sky and I'm here
 
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
because I've received testimony from two
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
family members and while I realize it's
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
not appropriate to read the testimony I
 
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
would just like to introduce it and then
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
pass it out for you to read
 
02:28:32.450 --> 02:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
um at your convenience so the first one
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
is the story of a single mom who has
 
02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
raised her child with complex
 
02:28:40.490 --> 02:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
disabilities and she was searching for a
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
Day program and you'd think that would
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
be a relatively easy thing to do but
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's not between his
 
02:28:49.309 --> 02:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
complex disabilities and then this
 
02:28:52.250 --> 02:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
individual also suffered from severe
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
physical and emotional abuse in Prior
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
care those two came together and it made
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
it very difficult to find an appropriate
 
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
program for him to enter into they
 
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
finally found a program that works great
 
02:29:07.849 --> 02:29:07.859 align:start position:0%
and he's thriving but the provider just
 
02:29:11.389 --> 02:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
informed this family member that they
 
02:29:12.770 --> 02:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
will not be doing direct billing to
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid any longer so now she is
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
wondering what to do with her son and
 
02:29:19.730 --> 02:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
you can read her story here
 
02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
the second the second testimony is from
 
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
another single mom who was talking about
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
when the state switched from a fee-based
 
02:29:31.969 --> 02:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
service to an HMO service for Medicaid
 
02:29:35.349 --> 02:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
and what ensued after that transition
 
02:29:37.969 --> 02:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
evidently some of the providers that
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
they use in specialists in Boston
 
02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
weren't part of the provider Network so
 
02:29:44.510 --> 02:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
it left her child without care until the
 
02:29:46.429 --> 02:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
state was able to roll back the program
 
02:29:48.410 --> 02:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
for the disability community and work
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
out the details so that is this
 
02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will also email it to
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
you with our direct contact information
 
02:29:55.730 --> 02:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to reach out to them
 
02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to reach out to them
directly

02:30:30.170 --> 02:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
for the earlier confusion no problem
 
02:30:31.309 --> 02:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:34.969 --> 02:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
so I was asked to um speak on um to give
 
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
you some perspective from a vendor I am
 
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
a vendor that I'm the executive director
 
02:30:43.010 --> 02:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
of next steps community services and
 
02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
we're a pretty small agency that
 
02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:47.570 align:start position:0%
we're a pretty small agency that
provides

02:30:47.570 --> 02:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
provides
 
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
um its which is intensive treatment
 
02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
services we have nine programs
 
02:30:55.730 --> 02:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
amongst the state we serve 30 people
 
02:30:58.849 --> 02:30:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities mental health
 
02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
disorders and who and or who are Justice
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
involved we have 32 beds in our programs
 
02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
two of which are um designated receiving
 
02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
facility Beds which the state of New
 
02:31:16.730 --> 02:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is required by law to have we
 
02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
provide person-centered holistic
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment to those 30
 
02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:22.910 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment to those 30
individuals

02:31:22.910 --> 02:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
um a sample of our clients just so you
 
02:31:27.290 --> 02:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
know what kind of folks that we serve we
 
02:31:29.389 --> 02:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
had one guy that was in New Hampshire
 
02:31:31.429 --> 02:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
hospital for 14 years
 
02:31:34.370 --> 02:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
we have another person that was
 
02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:35.090 align:start position:0%
we have another person that was
um

02:31:35.090 --> 02:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:37.969 --> 02:31:37.979 align:start position:0%
in the spew the specialized psychiatric
 
02:31:42.170 --> 02:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
unit in Concord for many many years and
 
02:31:44.030 --> 02:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
was going back and forth between there
 
02:31:46.610 --> 02:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
and the designated receiving facility
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
we have a gentleman that has autism that
 
02:31:52.610 --> 02:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
pretty much you know not pretty much but
 
02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
no one else in the entire state would
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
serve so those are the kinds of folks
 
02:31:58.429 --> 02:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
that we serve the most about very
 
02:32:00.650 --> 02:32:00.660 align:start position:0%
challenging and vulnerable people
 
02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
a few years ago we were told that we
 
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
would be our way of conducting business
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
now would be changing
 
02:32:10.490 --> 02:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and to be honest we were kind of
 
02:32:12.250 --> 02:32:12.260 align:start position:0%
excited and happy about that because
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
although change is difficult it's also
 
02:32:18.530 --> 02:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
um a good thing that we were moving from
 
02:32:22.130 --> 02:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
individualized budgets to rate setting
 
02:32:24.170 --> 02:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
within this new system
 
02:32:25.610 --> 02:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
um that we were changing from area
 
02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
agencies doing the billing for us
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
passing it through to us to us vendors
 
02:32:33.170 --> 02:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
being required to do direct billing
 
02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
so in April 2021
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
we next steps um
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
applied to become a Medicaid provider
 
02:32:44.809 --> 02:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
and along the way we've checked in with
 
02:32:46.429 --> 02:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
folks to see where we were in that
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
process and we were told this past fall
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
that there was someone within the state
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
that were vetting these applications for
 
02:32:56.809 --> 02:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
vendors so as we stand right now this is
 
02:32:58.490 --> 02:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
almost two years later
 
02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
we still don't have a provider number
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
yet with Medicaid
 
02:33:03.359 --> 02:33:04.130 align:start position:0%
yet with Medicaid
um

02:33:04.130 --> 02:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
so what's more concerning even than that
 
02:33:08.450 --> 02:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure that could get worked
 
02:33:11.410 --> 02:33:11.420 align:start position:0%
out is that we don't have really a
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
comprehensive thorough plan on this new
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
system we don't have we I'm talking its
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
vendors providers don't have
 
02:33:23.630 --> 02:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
um what it really looks like what do our
 
02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
rates really look like what is the rate
 
02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:27.530 align:start position:0%
rates really look like what is the rate
structure

02:33:27.530 --> 02:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
structure
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
um when are we going to get the rates
 
02:33:31.010 --> 02:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
when will we receive the rates when
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be will we have a chance to
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate those rates
 
02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:35.809 align:start position:0%
negotiate those rates
um

02:33:35.809 --> 02:33:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:39.530 --> 02:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
the consequences of of that is that what
 
02:33:41.929 --> 02:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
if we can't sustain the business that
 
02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
we're currently doing within those rates
 
02:33:46.610 --> 02:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
what will happen to again we only have
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
30 clients that we serve but these are
 
02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
30 clients that have already been proven
 
02:33:54.349 --> 02:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
to not be able to get services with
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else if we if we as an agency
 
02:33:59.929 --> 02:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
can't sustain business and provide these
 
02:34:02.690 --> 02:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
services to these folks they will
 
02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
be going that's not wrapping up please
 
02:34:06.650 --> 02:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
they will be going out of state at a at
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
an extremely higher cost and I will not
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
be able to sustain my very small agency
 
02:34:12.479 --> 02:34:13.309 align:start position:0%
be able to sustain my very small agency
of

02:34:13.309 --> 02:34:13.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:34:15.530 --> 02:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
of that that we do very important work
 
02:34:17.929 --> 02:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
for people that again it's a small
 
02:34:21.950 --> 02:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
majority of the DD population but it's
 
02:34:23.090 --> 02:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
an important
 
02:34:23.100 --> 02:34:24.349 align:start position:0%
an important
sector

02:34:24.349 --> 02:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
sector
 
02:34:28.490 --> 02:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah any questions uh
 
02:34:29.809 --> 02:34:29.819 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:34:31.969 --> 02:34:31.979 align:start position:0%
thank you very just very briefly you
 
02:34:34.490 --> 02:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
told us about the number of persons you
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
serve could you tell us very briefly
 
02:34:39.650 --> 02:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
maybe the number of full-time equivalent
 
02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
jobs you have
 
02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:42.969 align:start position:0%
jobs you have
about

02:34:42.969 --> 02:34:42.979 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
120 staff members
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
is that what you mean yes and follow-up
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up are those full-time or
 
02:34:52.969 --> 02:34:52.979 align:start position:0%
part-timers full-time okay yeah thank
 
02:34:54.650 --> 02:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:34:57.710 --> 02:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nutter upon
 
02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:35:02.929 --> 02:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
um a couple years ago I chaired a
 
02:35:08.570 --> 02:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
commission on Senate Bill 86 and um
 
02:35:13.010 --> 02:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
it was our understanding that we have we
 
02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
had like 40 people in New Hampshire
 
02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:16.070 align:start position:0%
had like 40 people in New Hampshire
whose

02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
whose
 
02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
um disabilities mental
 
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
judicially involved and wherever we're
 
02:35:22.849 --> 02:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
so severe that they were sent out of
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
state mostly to Florida for the tune of
 
02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:26.349 align:start position:0%
state mostly to Florida for the tune of
like

02:35:26.349 --> 02:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
380 000 a year
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
um for their care and do you have those
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
similar kind of patients in your
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
facilities Yes actually I mean again I
 
02:35:42.650 --> 02:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
think we're in the its
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
program service model there's only about
 
02:35:47.929 --> 02:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
you know 60 or so beds for those folks
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
of course we're interested in growing
 
02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
capacity so that we can take some of
 
02:35:54.650 --> 02:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
those folks back from Florida and other
 
02:35:56.090 --> 02:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
states Pennsylvania Massachusetts
 
02:35:56.100 --> 02:35:57.530 align:start position:0%
states Pennsylvania Massachusetts
whatever

02:35:57.530 --> 02:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
um but again where
 
02:36:01.490 --> 02:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
we're questioning whether we're going to
 
02:36:03.889 --> 02:36:03.899 align:start position:0%
be able to do business I can't I can't
 
02:36:05.630 --> 02:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
go to my board and say everything's
 
02:36:08.929 --> 02:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
going to be fine this fiscal year when I
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't even know what our rates are right
 
02:36:14.510 --> 02:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
now thank you so thank you okay thank
 
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:36:21.710 --> 02:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:24.770 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
you

02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Ellen
 
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:39.530 --> 02:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:36:43.309 --> 02:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Ellen McCann
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of Community
 
02:36:48.349 --> 02:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
Support Network which is the association
 
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
of area agencies
 
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh and several of the CEOs have spoken
 
02:36:55.490 --> 02:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
this morning I want to thank you for the
 
02:36:58.130 --> 02:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on behalf of HB
 
02:37:01.610 --> 02:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
608 and act for establishing a pilot
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
program to support the Bureau of
 
02:37:06.170 --> 02:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services redesigned
 
02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
I've been referring to this redesign
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
work as system transformation work
 
02:37:14.270 --> 02:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
because that is truly what's happening
 
02:37:16.429 --> 02:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
A system that has been in place for over
 
02:37:20.330 --> 02:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
35 years is being transformed and how it
 
02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
delivers and is reimbursed for services
 
02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
this is more transformation than at any
 
02:37:28.610 --> 02:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
time in the system's history
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
all being done while we are recovering
 
02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
from a pandemic and experiencing an
 
02:37:36.889 --> 02:37:36.899 align:start position:0%
unprecedented Workforce shortage
 
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
we support the need for this
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
transformation work as it will update
 
02:37:43.490 --> 02:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
some Antiquated processes and bring us
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
into compliance with Federal Regulations
 
02:37:48.290 --> 02:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
which is needed to obtain our federal
 
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
match dollars but and you've heard this
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
in a couple of other testimonies we are
 
02:37:56.690 --> 02:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
for change done right
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
the transformation requires the
 
02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:00.469 align:start position:0%
the transformation requires the
following

02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
following
 
02:38:03.010 --> 02:38:03.020 align:start position:0%
an overhauled I.T system
 
02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
revised core fundamental rules and a new
 
02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
revised core fundamental rules and a new
rule

02:38:07.750 --> 02:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
rule
 
02:38:10.429 --> 02:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
re-engineering many critical business
 
02:38:10.439 --> 02:38:12.110 align:start position:0%
re-engineering many critical business
processes

02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
processes
 
02:38:15.730 --> 02:38:15.740 align:start position:0%
new and revised extensive documentation
 
02:38:18.889 --> 02:38:18.899 align:start position:0%
comprehensive training a new slate of
 
02:38:18.899 --> 02:38:19.969 align:start position:0%
comprehensive training a new slate of
rates

02:38:19.969 --> 02:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
thoughtful organizational restructuring
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
and change management with thousands of
 
02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:27.410 align:start position:0%
and change management with thousands of
employees

02:38:27.410 --> 02:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:38:29.690 --> 02:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
families and individuals
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
that's a lot
 
02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
system transformation is no small tasks
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
these components I just itemized need to
 
02:38:43.610 --> 02:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
work together seamlessly like the gears
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
of a clock changes must be modeled out
 
02:38:50.929 --> 02:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
tested and piloted
 
02:38:50.939 --> 02:38:52.309 align:start position:0%
tested and piloted
why

02:38:52.309 --> 02:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:38:55.250 --> 02:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
to ensure new processes are fully
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
understood and that they work that rates
 
02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
are viable and that everyone understands
 
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
their role and responsibilities in the
 
02:39:05.170 --> 02:39:05.180 align:start position:0%
new system
 
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
this is change done right
 
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
and this is the spirit behind hb608 an
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
approach that ensures the least
 
02:39:18.230 --> 02:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
disruptive go live there are some things
 
02:39:19.490 --> 02:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
we want to talk about with
 
02:39:21.889 --> 02:39:21.899 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards that may impact
 
02:39:24.530 --> 02:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
the Bill's language a bit we want to
 
02:39:26.809 --> 02:39:26.819 align:start position:0%
make sure we utilize the right pilot
 
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
approach to ensure the stability and
 
02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the system
 
02:39:34.490 --> 02:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
the individuals and families this system
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
serves deserve no less they must have a
 
02:39:42.349 --> 02:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
stable system to ensure that the
 
02:39:44.770 --> 02:39:44.780 align:start position:0%
services that support them in living
 
02:39:48.429 --> 02:39:48.439 align:start position:0%
fulfilling lives are not disrupted
 
02:39:51.650 --> 02:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
individuals and families must not be the
 
02:39:53.330 --> 02:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
collateral damage in achieving
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
compliance by meeting a date
 
02:39:59.090 --> 02:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
large projects of this nature typically
 
02:40:02.450 --> 02:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
have Pilots of varying kinds scenario
 
02:40:05.090 --> 02:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
analyzes system testing extensive
 
02:40:07.849 --> 02:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
modeling of rates and processes and
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
we're confident we can work with the
 
02:40:11.210 --> 02:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
division of long-term supports and
 
02:40:13.130 --> 02:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
services and its Consultants to make
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
this happen you can begin wrapping up
 
02:40:17.570 --> 02:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
please yes
 
02:40:19.490 --> 02:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I will say
 
02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:20.270 align:start position:0%
um I will say
um

02:40:20.270 --> 02:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
on October 1st 2013 there was another go

basically there were three things too
 
02:40:51.770 --> 02:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
much work to do and not enough time the

they could easily push out the date to

02:51:32.690 --> 02:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Deborah descents I'm a
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
resident of Exeter uh and I'm in support
 
02:51:38.570 --> 02:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
of the pilot program
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
I am the mother of an adult man who
 
02:51:43.610 --> 02:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
receives Services through the Bureau of
 
02:51:46.370 --> 02:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services I am because of
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
him I founded an agency farmsteads of
 
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
New England over 20 years ago
 
02:51:58.030 --> 02:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
to provide services for him and others
 
02:52:02.030 --> 02:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
we are a fairly small agency we serve
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 individuals
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh in both day and and or Residential
 
02:52:08.399 --> 02:52:09.849 align:start position:0%
uh in both day and and or Residential
Services

02:52:09.849 --> 02:52:09.859 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:52:13.250 --> 02:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
we have a budget of about four million
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
dollars uh and have about 80 employees
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
most of whom are full-time and most of
 
02:52:22.969 --> 02:52:22.979 align:start position:0%
whom are providing Direct Care we have a
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
skeleton crew uh in terms of the
 
02:52:28.130 --> 02:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
administrative office
 
02:52:30.130 --> 02:52:30.140 align:start position:0%
I I have
 
02:52:34.429 --> 02:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
three aspects of the system change that
 
02:52:37.630 --> 02:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
are worrisome right now the first is
 
02:52:39.769 --> 02:52:39.779 align:start position:0%
direct billing
 
02:52:42.410 --> 02:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh when I first heard about direct
 
02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
billing I thought well that's nice you
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
know we'll have an option we can bill
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
for ourselves or we can continue to have
 
02:52:51.130 --> 02:52:51.140 align:start position:0%
the area agencies built for us
 
02:52:54.769 --> 02:52:54.779 align:start position:0%
but what we have learned uh in recent
 
02:52:58.730 --> 02:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
months is that we can only have one
 
02:53:02.570 --> 02:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
agency bill for us the one trading
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
partner as they call it so even though
 
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
we have contracts with six of the area
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
agencies we would have to find one
 
02:53:14.389 --> 02:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
agency willing to do all our billing
 
02:53:16.670 --> 02:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
um some of the area agencies have
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
recently announced that they do not have
 
02:53:21.469 --> 02:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and will not be able
 
02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
to bill for uh agencies
 
02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:26.150 align:start position:0%
to bill for uh agencies
um

02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:30.889 --> 02:53:30.899 align:start position:0%
there is one agency that has said they
 
02:53:33.889 --> 02:53:33.899 align:start position:0%
are going to spend the money to improve
 
02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure and they will do
 
02:53:40.269 --> 02:53:40.279 align:start position:0%
the billing for anyone who wants
 
02:53:43.130 --> 02:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
and while the individual price seems
 
02:53:46.190 --> 02:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable it would end up costing us
 
02:53:48.650 --> 02:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
for our 40 individuals twenty thousand
 
02:53:49.849 --> 02:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
and that is twenty thousand dollars we
 
02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
02:53:56.630 --> 02:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh under the current
 
02:53:56.640 --> 02:53:57.469 align:start position:0%
uh under the current
um

02:53:57.469 --> 02:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:59.570 --> 02:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
current system
 
02:54:03.410 --> 02:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh I can also say that uh I'm a member
 
02:54:05.510 --> 02:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the private provider Network so
 
02:54:08.990 --> 02:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
there's about 20 agencies
 
02:54:12.290 --> 02:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
um who I can't say that I speak for all
 
02:54:13.849 --> 02:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
of them but I can say that in
 
02:54:17.450 --> 02:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
discussions with the PPN group everyone
 
02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
is concerned uh how are they going to
 
02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
handle this we have had no training in
 
02:54:26.690 --> 02:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
how to do direct billing if we make a
 
02:54:28.730 --> 02:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
mistake it can take months to correct
 
02:54:32.090 --> 02:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
that mistake and to be paid and small
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
agencies like marcelves
 
02:54:37.790 --> 02:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
cannot wait months to get paid because
 
02:54:41.570 --> 02:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
my 80 employees need their paycheck this
 
02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:44.150 align:start position:0%
my 80 employees need their paycheck this
week

02:54:44.150 --> 02:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:47.809 --> 02:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
um the second area is the prior
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
authorization wrapping up man please yep
 
02:54:53.630 --> 02:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
prior authorization system again we've
 
02:54:55.670 --> 02:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
had no training in how to do prior
 
02:54:57.469 --> 02:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
authorizations even though we'll be
 
02:54:58.910 --> 02:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
required to
 
02:55:01.550 --> 02:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh and again there's going to be an
 
02:55:04.490 --> 02:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
expense to that and the rates haven't
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
been set yet so we have no idea
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
what the rates will be and if it will
 
02:55:11.990 --> 02:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
cover that
 
02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.389 align:start position:0%
cover that
um

02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:18.349 --> 02:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh and then the rates themselves a large
 
02:55:20.750 --> 02:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:22.070 align:start position:0%
part of the
um

02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:25.370 --> 02:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
the way the rates are being developed
 
02:55:30.110 --> 02:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
is based on 2021 data uh that the
 
02:55:32.330 --> 02:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
various agencies have provided and the
 
02:55:38.690 --> 02:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
cost reports uh in 21 2021 data is based
 
02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
in large part on historical budgets that
 
02:55:43.429 --> 02:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
may have been developed 10 or 15 years
 
02:55:45.530 --> 02:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
ago because we don't get cost of living
 
02:55:48.349 --> 02:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
increases every year
 
02:55:51.050 --> 02:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:55:53.870 --> 02:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not sufficient we
 
02:55:56.290 --> 02:55:56.300 align:start position:0%
that's part of why this is Staffing
 
02:56:00.110 --> 02:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
shortage today because we can't pay
 
02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
staff enough
 
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do the important work they do and
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap it up there I have submitted
 
02:56:10.130 --> 02:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
this testimony electronically a couple
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%

that
 
02:56:16.309 --> 02:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
could could we do you have a hard copy
 
02:56:18.110 --> 02:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
with you right now I do have one hard
 
02:56:19.790 --> 02:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
copy with me that'd be great if we could
 
02:56:21.650 --> 02:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
get it for the clerk
 
02:56:24.650 --> 02:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no questions okay thank you
 
02:56:33.410 --> 02:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you also signed up to speak is
 
02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:49.130 --> 02:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hand you some written stuff
 
02:56:55.550 --> 02:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.070 --> 02:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:57:00.889 --> 02:57:00.899 align:start position:0%

that written testimony speaks to the
what

02:57:01.790 --> 02:57:01.800 align:start position:0%

02:57:03.710 --> 02:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
and again you have three minutes that
 
02:57:05.690 --> 02:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
written testimony speaks to the what of
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
what we're hoping to accomplish with
 
02:57:09.170 --> 02:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
this legislation I'm going to speak to
 
02:57:11.389 --> 02:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
you now about the why
 
02:57:14.450 --> 02:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I am a parent of a 40 year old young
 
02:57:17.210 --> 02:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
woman who requires complete support she
 
02:57:19.610 --> 02:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
cannot walk speak do anything
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
independently I'm a single parent she
 
02:57:25.490 --> 02:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
lives at home with me therefore I am by
 
02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
definition part of her Hands-on Physical
 
02:57:30.889 --> 02:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
direct support team along with paid
 
02:57:36.010 --> 02:57:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
why this bill is important is because as
 
02:57:41.050 --> 02:57:41.060 align:start position:0%
you've already heard from the beginning
 
02:57:43.550 --> 02:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of this work let's put the federal
 
02:57:46.370 --> 02:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
mandate stuff aside over here for now a
 
02:57:47.870 --> 02:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
lot of the other initiatives that have
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
come out of the a m report were done
 
02:57:52.010 --> 02:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
completely without our input
 
02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
and as you can imagine there's nothing
 
02:57:56.269 --> 02:57:56.279 align:start position:0%
worse than having someone at thirty
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
thousand feet look at you and say I know
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
what you need
 
02:58:01.550 --> 02:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
instead of asking you
 
02:58:03.469 --> 02:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
we weren't asked
 
02:58:06.410 --> 02:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
and if we were asked we would have had a
 
02:58:07.790 --> 02:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
very different list of things that we
 
02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:08.590 align:start position:0%
very different list of things that we
saw

02:58:08.590 --> 02:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
saw
 
02:58:11.990 --> 02:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
as Hands-On part of the caregiving team
 
02:58:14.690 --> 02:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
that we needed in terms of initiative
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
supports where the state should be
 
02:58:19.490 --> 02:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
putting its attention
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
I will remind you that our entire system
 
02:58:25.550 --> 02:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
was created by us from the bottom up it
 
02:58:27.410 --> 02:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
was families that initiated the lawsuit
 
02:58:29.630 --> 02:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
that closed Laconia State School it was
 
02:58:31.550 --> 02:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
families that initiated Family Support
 
02:58:34.190 --> 02:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
legislation it was families who before
 
02:58:36.530 --> 02:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
the area agencies existed started their
 
02:58:39.050 --> 02:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
own little day programs Kimmy Nichols
 
02:58:40.610 --> 02:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
Center Debbie voter Center there are
 
02:58:43.490 --> 02:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
numerous of them came from us
 
02:58:45.650 --> 02:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
things like participant manage and
 
02:58:47.389 --> 02:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
directed Services which is a model
 
02:58:49.969 --> 02:58:49.979 align:start position:0%
option of managing your own supports
 
02:58:52.730 --> 02:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
came from us and the reason our system
 
02:58:55.429 --> 02:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
has historically always been highly
 
02:58:58.010 --> 02:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
ranked in the top five nationally is
 
02:59:01.130 --> 02:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
because we have been a bottom-up system
 
02:59:04.370 --> 02:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
and we've luckily had the opportunity to
 
02:59:06.710 --> 02:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the state on building
 
02:59:09.410 --> 02:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
that and the lens historically had been
 
02:59:11.330 --> 02:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
from the state perspective of how will
 
02:59:13.190 --> 02:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
that decision affect the uses of the
 
02:59:15.170 --> 02:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
system first and foremost let's look at
 
02:59:17.330 --> 02:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
that before we pull a trigger on
 
02:59:19.969 --> 02:59:19.979 align:start position:0%
anything that has not happened here
 
02:59:22.309 --> 02:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
why this legislation is important it's
 
02:59:24.769 --> 02:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
one of the few opportunities we have to
 
02:59:26.809 --> 02:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
slow down look at the things that aren't
 
02:59:29.630 --> 02:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
federally mandated and make sure that we
 
02:59:32.750 --> 02:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
on the ground the families who
 
02:59:34.849 --> 02:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
ultimately are going to have to clean up
 
02:59:38.690 --> 02:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
the mess if any one piece of it isn't
 
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
proven to work that's why this is
 
02:59:45.170 --> 02:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
important it's crucial that families and
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
individuals that use the system be
 
02:59:49.130 --> 02:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
literally part of the team that will
 
02:59:50.990 --> 02:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
create these Pilots
 
02:59:53.630 --> 02:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
Define what we want these Pilots to
 
02:59:53.640 --> 02:59:54.530 align:start position:0%
Define what we want these Pilots to
prove

02:59:54.530 --> 02:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
prove
 
02:59:56.750 --> 02:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
administer the pilots and do the
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
analysis of the data that is those
 
03:00:01.309 --> 03:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
crucial seats must must be held by users
 
03:00:03.110 --> 03:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the system
 
03:00:06.769 --> 03:00:06.779 align:start position:0%
we are the experts in the field
 
03:00:09.170 --> 03:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
make no mistake
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
and I have no question about many
 
03:00:15.469 --> 03:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
well-meaning people that work up at 30
 
03:00:17.570 --> 03:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
000 feet looking trying to fix things
 
03:00:17.580 --> 03:00:19.550 align:start position:0%
000 feet looking trying to fix things
but

03:00:19.550 --> 03:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:00:22.429 --> 03:00:22.439 align:start position:0%
ignorance is no excuse even if you're
 
03:00:22.439 --> 03:00:23.870 align:start position:0%
ignorance is no excuse even if you're
well-meaning

03:00:23.870 --> 03:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
well-meaning
 
03:00:27.050 --> 03:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
we need to be asked
 
03:00:31.010 --> 03:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
we need to be shown and when you get a
 
03:00:32.690 --> 03:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
chance to look at the written testimony
 
03:00:34.969 --> 03:00:34.979 align:start position:0%
I gave you I'd call your attention to
 
03:00:37.130 --> 03:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
the second sheet where I give you some
 
03:00:40.190 --> 03:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
math of the value
 
03:00:42.830 --> 03:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
based on statistics and I've cited all
 
03:00:46.429 --> 03:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
my data last year the value of the free
 
03:00:49.849 --> 03:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
supports families provide often to their
 
03:00:51.410 --> 03:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
own death
 
03:00:53.990 --> 03:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll leave you with this the
 
03:00:55.730 --> 03:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
direction things are going which are
 
03:00:58.250 --> 03:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
back to Medical model thinking siloing
 
03:00:58.260 --> 03:00:59.110 align:start position:0%
back to Medical model thinking siloing
people

03:00:59.110 --> 03:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:00:59.120 --> 03:01:00.670 align:start position:0%
people
and

03:01:00.670 --> 03:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:02.990 --> 03:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
restricting freedom of how each
 
03:01:04.849 --> 03:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
individual gets to choose what they want
 
03:01:07.610 --> 03:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
their life to look like
 
03:01:11.030 --> 03:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
I have no faith in that direction and as
 
03:01:13.130 --> 03:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
a parent who will be in a couple of
 
03:01:16.490 --> 03:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
weeks will be 65. my best option right
 
03:01:19.610 --> 03:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
now of what I'm hoping for is that my
 
03:01:22.610 --> 03:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
daughter dies before I do
 
03:01:24.290 --> 03:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
and that's a pretty awful thing for a
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
parent to have to hope for I hope none
 
03:01:29.450 --> 03:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
of you ever have to hope for that
 
03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
but we can fix it if we slow it down and
 
03:01:34.910 --> 03:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
ask us and that's what this bill seeks
 
03:01:36.769 --> 03:01:36.779 align:start position:0%
to do thank you
 
03:01:36.779 --> 03:01:39.910 align:start position:0%
to do thank you
questions

03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative gophalt
 
03:01:44.570 --> 03:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so and in the uh at
 
03:01:48.469 --> 03:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the uh first page of the
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
materials you handed us you refer to a
 
03:01:52.849 --> 03:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
concern that service definitions are
 
03:01:55.070 --> 03:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
being changed and you make the statement
 
03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
being changed and you make the statement
that

03:01:56.870 --> 03:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:56.880 --> 03:01:57.590 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
how they are defined matters very
 
03:02:03.410 --> 03:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
specifically so I'm wondering if you
 
03:02:05.450 --> 03:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
could speak to that a little bit further
 
03:02:07.309 --> 03:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
for us thank you I'll give you an
 
03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
example I I work in the field of patents
 
03:02:12.590 --> 03:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I work with a lot of patent
 
03:02:14.650 --> 03:02:14.660 align:start position:0%
attorneys and when a patent attorney
 
03:02:17.210 --> 03:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
writes the claims of why this is a
 
03:02:18.769 --> 03:02:18.779 align:start position:0%
unique invention they try to make those
 
03:02:21.370 --> 03:02:21.380 align:start position:0%
claims very broad that's always the goal
 
03:02:23.750 --> 03:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
and because you want to you want as many
 
03:02:26.030 --> 03:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
little variations to fit and still have
 
03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:28.790 align:start position:0%
little variations to fit and still have
protection

03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.250 --> 03:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
umbrella definitions of services would
 
03:02:33.230 --> 03:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
be like
 
03:02:35.929 --> 03:02:35.939 align:start position:0%
if you want this service you need to
 
03:02:38.450 --> 03:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
pick something that's blue
 
03:02:41.330 --> 03:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
well this navy blue aqua teal light blue
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
sky blue Etc you get a lot of
 
03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
flexibility to find a blue
 
03:02:47.630 --> 03:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
but if service definitions are narrowed
 
03:02:50.330 --> 03:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
to say you can have the navy blue one or
 
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
the powder blue one
 
03:02:53.630 --> 03:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
well that narrows how you're going to
 
03:02:57.710 --> 03:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
choose to implement your idea of a life
 
03:03:00.349 --> 03:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
and if you read any of in our law if you
 
03:03:02.090 --> 03:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
read any of the history of this system
 
03:03:05.450 --> 03:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
it has always been designed and worked
 
03:03:08.269 --> 03:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
toward allowing an individual with a
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
disability to access what I call my word
 
03:03:13.849 --> 03:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
an ordinary life the similar kind of a
 
03:03:15.170 --> 03:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
life that you would have be able to make
 
03:03:16.849 --> 03:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
the similar kind of choices that you
 
03:03:19.070 --> 03:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
have do the similar kinds of things that
 
03:03:20.929 --> 03:03:20.939 align:start position:0%
you would want to do but obviously with
 
03:03:22.849 --> 03:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
needing some supports and get as close
 
03:03:25.010 --> 03:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
to that as we possibly can as close to
 
03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
that Equity of a good life
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
and when you narrow service definitions
 
03:03:34.250 --> 03:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
to plug them into a rate that by
 
03:03:34.260 --> 03:03:35.170 align:start position:0%

definition
 
03:03:39.469 --> 03:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
Narrows flexibility and freedom and we
 
03:03:41.630 --> 03:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
haven't seen them yet that's the point
 
03:03:43.670 --> 03:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll be wonderful and terribly
 
03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:44.750 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll be wonderful and terribly
Broad

03:03:44.750 --> 03:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
Broad
 
03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:46.370 align:start position:0%
Broad
but

03:03:46.370 --> 03:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:03:49.610 --> 03:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
how can you implement something we again
 
03:03:52.670 --> 03:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
on the ground haven't seen yet so we can
 
03:03:53.929 --> 03:03:53.939 align:start position:0%
at least advise you if there's an
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence to that decision
 
03:03:58.990 --> 03:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
at least at least thank you
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:04:07.130 --> 03:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:09.769 --> 03:04:09.779 align:start position:0%
would you agree or disagree that in
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
order to have a pilot
 
03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:13.130 align:start position:0%
order to have a pilot
program

03:04:13.130 --> 03:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:04:14.990 --> 03:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's essential that we actually have a
 
03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
design to Pilot
 
03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
so what I'm hearing throughout this
 
03:04:20.210 --> 03:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
testimony is that we really don't even
 
03:04:23.330 --> 03:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
have a good design yet on the table
 
03:04:25.309 --> 03:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
so if we don't have a good design on the
 
03:04:25.319 --> 03:04:26.150 align:start position:0%
so if we don't have a good design on the
table

03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
table
 
03:04:28.849 --> 03:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
how can we have a pilot program if we
 
03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the design in place in other
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
words if you're going to have a model
 
03:04:35.450 --> 03:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
car you design the car and then you
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
create the model and you test it but I
 
03:04:39.410 --> 03:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
don't see a design yet as everybody's
 
03:04:42.230 --> 03:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
agreed to I think what we have is the
 
03:04:44.929 --> 03:04:44.939 align:start position:0%
set of questions or a good start on the
 
03:04:46.370 --> 03:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
set of questions that need to be
 
03:04:49.730 --> 03:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
answered because we've been asking them
 
03:04:51.590 --> 03:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
um you know in addition to a parent just
 
03:04:53.330 --> 03:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
to give you background I am a governing
 
03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
officer of one of the area agencies so
 
03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a board member I am on the
 
03:04:58.730 --> 03:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
developmental Services quality Council
 
03:05:01.070 --> 03:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
since its Inception and was chair for
 
03:05:03.410 --> 03:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
the first seven or eight years of it and
 
03:05:05.809 --> 03:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
I am on multiple committees
 
03:05:08.330 --> 03:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
related to the redesign process
 
03:05:12.590 --> 03:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm a knowledgeable parent I'm a
 
03:05:14.210 --> 03:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable member of this
 
03:05:16.490 --> 03:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
constituency we have asked many many
 
03:05:20.090 --> 03:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
many very detailed specific questions we
 
03:05:22.969 --> 03:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
do not have answers to and some of these
 
03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
Pilots would be geared to answering
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
those questions if you want one example
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
I can give it to you but I don't want to
 
03:05:30.290 --> 03:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
monopolize time thank you other
 
03:05:30.300 --> 03:05:32.929 align:start position:0%
monopolize time thank you other
questions

03:05:32.929 --> 03:05:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:34.670 --> 03:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
03:05:39.950 --> 03:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
just so everyone knows what what the
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
plan is we we are running behind but we
 
03:05:44.150 --> 03:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
are going to finish up this bill and
 
03:05:46.130 --> 03:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
what the plan is then to break for lunch
 
03:05:48.530 --> 03:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
and then take up the remaining two bills
 
03:05:54.290 --> 03:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
which are HB 238 and hb2 HB 317 and then
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
of course we'll be proceeding into
 
03:05:58.190 --> 03:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
executive sessions so if you're waiting
 
03:05:59.809 --> 03:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
for those other two bills we just want
 
03:06:01.250 --> 03:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
to let you know what the plan is
 
03:06:03.410 --> 03:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
just for planning purposes I am aware am
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
I correct in thinking we only have one
 
03:06:11.269 --> 03:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
early Bill still left to exec I think
 
03:06:13.010 --> 03:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's two isn't it we have two early
 
03:06:15.110 --> 03:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
bills to exec and we have another one
 
03:06:16.849 --> 03:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
that's looming on a May 11th Federal
 
03:06:19.010 --> 03:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
expiration of benefits so we have three
 
03:06:21.889 --> 03:06:21.899 align:start position:0%
that must be out today okay
 
03:06:26.210 --> 03:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm just concerned because uh we have
 
03:06:28.670 --> 03:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
those execs that are time critical we
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
have Bill hearings that are not time
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
critical but understandably concerning
 
03:06:35.090 --> 03:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
for the people who have been waiting for
 
03:06:38.809 --> 03:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
them uh but a number of us also have
 
03:06:41.570 --> 03:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
time issues at the end of the day so I
 
03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
just want to be sure that we're planning
 
03:06:45.650 --> 03:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
for that because it has been our
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
practice not to go past a certain time
 
03:06:50.690 --> 03:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
and I think people plan on that we're
 
03:06:52.370 --> 03:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
definitely going to take up the time
 
03:06:55.210 --> 03:06:55.220 align:start position:0%
sensitive executive session bills okay
 
03:06:58.309 --> 03:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:07:00.349 --> 03:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
03:07:03.010 --> 03:07:03.020 align:start position:0%
chairman I would just like to remind the
 
03:07:05.330 --> 03:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
committee and people in the audience
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
that one of the bills coming up
 
03:07:11.870 --> 03:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 238 involves
 
03:07:11.880 --> 03:07:12.590 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 238 involves
um

03:07:12.590 --> 03:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:14.929 --> 03:07:14.939 align:start position:0%
some of the similar ideas of what we've
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
been talking about which is really about
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
um people who are most affected being
 
03:07:22.429 --> 03:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
represented in the process so
 
03:07:25.010 --> 03:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
I know this oh people want to have their
 
03:07:26.450 --> 03:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
say and people want to ask their
 
03:07:28.010 --> 03:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
questions but there there's going to be
 
03:07:31.370 --> 03:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
some overlap when we talk about 2 30
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
when we have a hearing for 238
 
03:07:36.530 --> 03:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:07:38.929 --> 03:07:38.939 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:07:41.210 --> 03:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
okay hearing saying no one no other
 
03:07:43.550 --> 03:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
comments moving on the next person who
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh who has signed up to testify on hb608
 
03:07:57.530 --> 03:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
ma'am you've asked for five minutes if
 
03:08:01.490 --> 03:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
you could cut it down to three it'd be
 
03:08:01.500 --> 03:08:04.570 align:start position:0%
you could cut it down to three it'd be
great

03:08:04.570 --> 03:08:04.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
I will endeavor to read quickly sir okay
 
03:08:08.809 --> 03:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:10.969 --> 03:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
um and the only question I have is how
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
do I submit this to you because I just
 
03:08:14.690 --> 03:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
brought my copy to read
 
03:08:17.210 --> 03:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
how do I if you can just give it to the
 
03:08:19.070 --> 03:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
clerk okay because I've got notes on it
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
is that okay that's okay okay
 
03:08:24.110 --> 03:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:08:30.530 --> 03:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to ask you or to oppose as
 
03:08:33.769 --> 03:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
written uh House Bill 608 my name is
 
03:08:36.290 --> 03:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
Gina Cannon and I live here in Concord
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
with my husband and my daughter
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
prior to my daughter's birth I practiced
 
03:08:42.650 --> 03:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
law in Concord in Manchester
 
03:08:45.290 --> 03:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
I worked for New Hampshire DHHS as a
 
03:08:46.790 --> 03:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
hearings officer
 
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
and following her birth in order to have
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
the flexibility needed for her care I
 
03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
ran my own business as a private
 
03:08:56.690 --> 03:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
Professional Guardian for over a decade
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
I also worked for a brief stint in
 
03:09:00.469 --> 03:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
low-level administration at our local
 
03:09:03.530 --> 03:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
area agency and most recently served as
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
a term on our school board
 
03:09:07.610 --> 03:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
but that's me and that's not why I'm
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
here today I'm concerned for my daughter
 
03:09:14.090 --> 03:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
my daughter has multiple medical issues
 
03:09:16.429 --> 03:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
which result in her having considerable
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
developmental delays and which require
 
03:09:21.309 --> 03:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
complex Medical Care
 
03:09:23.450 --> 03:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
we are lucky
 
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
she's incredibly smart verbal and
 
03:09:27.950 --> 03:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
opinionated and she will in all
 
03:09:30.410 --> 03:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
likelihood never be able to live
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
independently and will be dependent upon
 
03:09:34.849 --> 03:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
the DD waiver system
 
03:09:37.130 --> 03:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
although she's very bright with her
 
03:09:39.230 --> 03:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
combined disabilities according to a
 
03:09:41.090 --> 03:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
recent study by the National Institute
 
03:09:44.090 --> 03:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
of Health the longitudinal probability
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
of her obtaining sufficient life skills
 
03:09:48.950 --> 03:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
and or employment sufficient to allow
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
her to live an independent life is
 
03:09:54.170 --> 03:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
statistically zero
 
03:09:56.809 --> 03:09:56.819 align:start position:0%
let me repeat that studies show despite
 
03:09:59.330 --> 03:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
an intellect well above average she will
 
03:10:01.570 --> 03:10:01.580 align:start position:0%
likely never be able to live
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
independently due to her developmental
 
03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:05.330 align:start position:0%
independently due to her developmental
disabilities

03:10:05.330 --> 03:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
she will turn 18 in just over six weeks
 
03:10:09.889 --> 03:10:09.899 align:start position:0%
and will start her transition into the
 
03:10:12.590 --> 03:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
world of Adult Services her father and I
 
03:10:14.389 --> 03:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
are justifiably concerned about the
 
03:10:17.090 --> 03:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
quality of life she can expect to have
 
03:10:19.490 --> 03:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
I have seen wonderful Services provided
 
03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
within our DD waiver system and
 
03:10:24.110 --> 03:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
appallingly horrific failures to provide
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
minimally appropriate services
 
03:10:28.370 --> 03:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
I do not believe there is a single
 
03:10:30.889 --> 03:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
person in attendance today who would
 
03:10:33.530 --> 03:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
willingly live The Limited lives that
 
03:10:35.389 --> 03:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
some of our adult intellectually and
 
03:10:37.370 --> 03:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled individuals
 
03:10:37.380 --> 03:10:38.450 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled individuals
live

03:10:38.450 --> 03:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
live
 
03:10:41.450 --> 03:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
they are for the most part not the full
 
03:10:43.809 --> 03:10:43.819 align:start position:0%
meaningful lives rich with relationships
 
03:10:46.849 --> 03:10:46.859 align:start position:0%
experiences and opportunities to
 
03:10:48.530 --> 03:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
contribute that we would want for our
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
loved ones
 
03:10:52.730 --> 03:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
please make no mistake our system needs
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
significant correction
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
but therein lies the difficulty and I do
 
03:10:59.150 --> 03:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
not envy your responsibilities today for
 
03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
after hours and hours of reading
 
03:11:04.190 --> 03:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
listening talking to various people with
 
03:11:06.530 --> 03:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
various points of view I sit before you
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
this morning to ask you to look at hb608
 
03:11:10.730 --> 03:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
with the same lens that you look at the
 
03:11:13.969 --> 03:11:13.979 align:start position:0%
underlying BDS restructuring with some
 
03:11:17.150 --> 03:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
healthy skepticism and wariness
 
03:11:19.010 --> 03:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
we've heard today change is difficult
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
people are afraid of the change people
 
03:11:23.210 --> 03:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
don't understand the change the
 
03:11:25.790 --> 03:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
underlying redesign has insufficient
 
03:11:27.889 --> 03:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
details at this point for individuals
 
03:11:30.650 --> 03:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
family members area agencies vendors or
 
03:11:33.290 --> 03:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
frankly anyone else to know with any
 
03:11:34.969 --> 03:11:34.979 align:start position:0%
degree of certainty whether this
 
03:11:37.250 --> 03:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
redesign will be positive or negative in
 
03:11:39.469 --> 03:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
the lives of some of our most vulnerable
 
03:11:41.090 --> 03:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
citizens you can begin wrapping up man
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
yep at the same time this bill has
 
03:11:45.230 --> 03:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
insufficient details to know whether
 
03:11:48.050 --> 03:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
enacting it would be of harm or benefit
 
03:11:50.450 --> 03:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
we have no standardized assessments
 
03:11:52.370 --> 03:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
across the state we have no standardized
 
03:11:55.849 --> 03:11:55.859 align:start position:0%
implementation we have no idea of the
 
03:11:58.250 --> 03:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
destination of this pilot project and
 
03:12:00.050 --> 03:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
how in the world do you know if you've
 
03:12:02.210 --> 03:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
arrived if or whether you need to
 
03:12:06.170 --> 03:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
backtrack if you have no goals
 
03:12:09.290 --> 03:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
in my opinion neither HP 608 nor the
 
03:12:10.670 --> 03:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
current redesign has sufficient
 
03:12:13.330 --> 03:12:13.340 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at this time to advance
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
and both need to return to the drawing
 
03:12:18.650 --> 03:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
board to develop infrastructure prior to
 
03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:27.230 --> 03:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
um I've just most problematically
 
03:12:28.910 --> 03:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
however is the distressingly imminent
 
03:12:33.830 --> 03:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
deadline centered by uh sorry set by CMS
 
03:12:35.809 --> 03:12:35.819 align:start position:0%
um the state of New Hampshire has known
 
03:12:37.730 --> 03:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
of this correction of action necessary
 
03:12:40.250 --> 03:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
since 2016 and we still have
 
03:12:43.490 --> 03:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
insufficient details of how we are going
 
03:12:46.910 --> 03:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
to comply this potentially risks 162
 
03:12:50.929 --> 03:12:50.939 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's 50 funding for
 
03:12:54.429 --> 03:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
approximately 5500 of our most
 
03:12:57.230 --> 03:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens
 
03:12:58.969 --> 03:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
okay thank you ladies and gentlemen I
 
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
don't envy you but this Mass has
 
03:13:02.269 --> 03:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately dropped squarely in your
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
lap thank you questions
 
03:13:08.210 --> 03:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions for this yes
 
03:13:11.330 --> 03:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative McLean yeah uh thank you
 
03:13:12.590 --> 03:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
03:13:15.410 --> 03:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
question so it sounds like if I'm
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
teasing out what you're saying you have
 
03:13:19.309 --> 03:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
a problem not just with the pilot but
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
with the redesign as well so as you say
 
03:13:25.429 --> 03:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
say you're opposed to it as written so I
 
03:13:27.530 --> 03:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
guess what what approach would you be
 
03:13:27.540 --> 03:13:29.030 align:start position:0%
guess what what approach would you be
advocating

03:13:29.030 --> 03:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
advocating
 
03:13:31.010 --> 03:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
um at this point well I think one of the
 
03:13:32.510 --> 03:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
things that's been suggested is that
 
03:13:34.370 --> 03:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
we're putting the cart before even
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
knowing whether it's a horse cart or a a
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
goat cart we don't know we need more
 
03:13:43.969 --> 03:13:43.979 align:start position:0%
details I would like to see BDS roll out
 
03:13:46.130 --> 03:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
a pilot project itself but at this point
 
03:13:48.050 --> 03:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough of a plan to know
 
03:13:49.969 --> 03:13:49.979 align:start position:0%
we have a pilot
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't think we can move
 
03:13:54.530 --> 03:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
forward requiring a pilot when we don't
 
03:13:57.170 --> 03:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
have an underlying plan
 
03:14:00.469 --> 03:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you very
 
03:14:02.399 --> 03:14:04.790 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you very
much

03:14:04.790 --> 03:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:06.410 --> 03:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative King can I
 
03:14:08.510 --> 03:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
approach that oh absolutely please come
 
03:14:08.520 --> 03:14:13.790 align:start position:0%
approach that oh absolutely please come
up

03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:16.849 --> 03:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
it's not Court yeah it's not Court I
 
03:14:20.450 --> 03:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:22.849 --> 03:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:14:25.250 --> 03:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Will Walker
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:38.269 --> 03:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
today thank you thanks for being here my
 
03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
name is Will Walker my wife Kelly and I
 
03:14:45.050 --> 03:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
live in Hollis with our 23 year old son
 
03:14:46.490 --> 03:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
who has autism
 
03:14:49.370 --> 03:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
he requires 24 7 observation okay so
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're directly impacted by the change
 
03:14:53.389 --> 03:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
Happening Here
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
um I've also in knee deep in this
 
03:14:58.910 --> 03:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
systems change I'm on two committees two
 
03:15:00.650 --> 03:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
working groups uh where the systems
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
change one is The Advisory Group and one
 
03:15:04.370 --> 03:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
is on the rates working group okay so
 
03:15:06.769 --> 03:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not just an outsider I'm also kind
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
of have an inside view of what's going
 
03:15:11.809 --> 03:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
on and I'm concerned and I'm here to ask
 
03:15:15.050 --> 03:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
for your support for HP 608
 
03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I've spent several decades in the
 
03:15:19.610 --> 03:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
software industry okay and as part of
 
03:15:21.530 --> 03:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
that I've released many projects and
 
03:15:23.330 --> 03:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
what you do in releasing a project is
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
you develop a a test plan you develop
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
success criteria you develop metrics for
 
03:15:31.490 --> 03:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
what it means to go live with your
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
project we call this a beta we'll go to
 
03:15:36.110 --> 03:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
Beta and we'll release it to a small set
 
03:15:38.809 --> 03:15:38.819 align:start position:0%
of customers see how it works out flesh
 
03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
out the problems find the unknowns and
 
03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
improve improve the software before we
 
03:15:46.250 --> 03:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
go live for the general public okay I
 
03:15:48.050 --> 03:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
don't see that being done here and I
 
03:15:52.849 --> 03:15:52.859 align:start position:0%
think hb608 allows us to do that okay
 
03:15:55.250 --> 03:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
and the the other thing I've been I've
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
been on a date driven deadline and the
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
results are usually a disaster okay my
 
03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
phone rings at 3 am in the morning I'm
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
on the phone the next day with the
 
03:16:06.769 --> 03:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
president of the company asking me why I
 
03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
cost a customer you know millions of
 
03:16:10.790 --> 03:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
dollars and lost because of a bug in our
 
03:16:12.889 --> 03:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
software okay we we don't want that to
 
03:16:15.050 --> 03:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
happen here right we we want our most
 
03:16:16.969 --> 03:16:16.979 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens to be in a stable
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
system okay so I support the idea of
 
03:16:22.190 --> 03:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
testing and vetting this system and
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
making sure it's going to serve our
 
03:16:26.290 --> 03:16:26.300 align:start position:0%
citizens our most vulnerable citizens
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately before it goes live okay
 
03:16:31.730 --> 03:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
so I support that and I'll just add one
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
more just you know anecdote my bank did
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
a systems change okay my it's I won't
 
03:16:39.889 --> 03:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
say who the bank is but they did a
 
03:16:42.230 --> 03:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
systems change what happened
 
03:16:45.590 --> 03:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
are automatic bill payments failed okay
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
so we weren't paying our electric bills
 
03:16:49.130 --> 03:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
we weren't paying our other bills that
 
03:16:50.990 --> 03:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
impacted us very negatively okay let's
 
03:16:54.050 --> 03:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
take that and now say okay this system
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
change happens and there's a bug in it
 
03:16:57.710 --> 03:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
and it's not about my electric bill
 
03:16:59.090 --> 03:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
anymore it's about whether my son
 
03:17:00.889 --> 03:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
receives Services it's about whether his
 
03:17:02.990 --> 03:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
direct support professional shows up to
 
03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
provide the services from that day okay
 
03:17:06.650 --> 03:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're risking here
 
03:17:09.650 --> 03:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
and as an Insider into this what I'm
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
seeing is that the devil is in the
 
03:17:15.410 --> 03:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
details okay these details surface every
 
03:17:17.450 --> 03:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
meeting a new issue comes up every
 
03:17:19.130 --> 03:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
meeting we don't understand the whole
 
03:17:21.950 --> 03:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
thing okay so a new issue comes up and I
 
03:17:23.690 --> 03:17:23.700 align:start position:0%
think Einstein said you know as the
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
circle of light grows so does the circle
 
03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
of Darkness okay so come out of these
 
03:17:30.290 --> 03:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
meetings and yes I understand that much
 
03:17:33.110 --> 03:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
better now but oh no I've got this many
 
03:17:36.710 --> 03:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
more questions than arose okay so when I
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
see that and as somebody who has led
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
projects and released them I am
 
03:17:44.210 --> 03:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
concerned that this is going too fast a
 
03:17:45.889 --> 03:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
pilot program will help us figure these
 
03:17:47.809 --> 03:17:47.819 align:start position:0%
things out better and do a much better
 
03:17:50.030 --> 03:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
job so we don't upset the system
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions yes
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:58.610 --> 03:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
03:18:00.170 --> 03:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
03:18:01.849 --> 03:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
this question I understand that you're
 
03:18:04.130 --> 03:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
in favor of the concept of having a
 
03:18:07.730 --> 03:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
pilot program and in reading the bill
 
03:18:07.740 --> 03:18:09.050 align:start position:0%
pilot program and in reading the bill
um

03:18:09.050 --> 03:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:11.090 --> 03:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
03:18:13.849 --> 03:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
the pilot program addressing and then it
 
03:18:16.130 --> 03:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
says topic shall include and it I won't
 
03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
I won't read it all but it includes
 
03:18:19.849 --> 03:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
various topics and then it says any
 
03:18:21.530 --> 03:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
additional changes to the existing
 
03:18:23.750 --> 03:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
system of care not defined in the
 
03:18:25.550 --> 03:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
contracts you'll also be included in the
 
03:18:28.969 --> 03:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
pilot program so the pilot program
 
03:18:31.610 --> 03:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
for my understand meager understanding
 
03:18:33.530 --> 03:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
of it is um
 
03:18:37.010 --> 03:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
is quite a a big pilot program I mean
 
03:18:40.250 --> 03:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's covering a lot of a lot of topics a
 
03:18:41.929 --> 03:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
lot of changes
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
um do you think there's
 
03:18:46.190 --> 03:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
what do you think it'll
 
03:18:50.990 --> 03:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
take to uh to design a pilot program and
 
03:18:54.290 --> 03:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
incorporate all these changes into the
 
03:18:57.769 --> 03:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
pilot and and and and addendum to that
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
question is can that be done by the um
 
03:19:01.439 --> 03:19:03.050 align:start position:0%
question is can that be done by the um
current

03:19:03.050 --> 03:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:19:03.060 --> 03:19:03.769 align:start position:0%
current
um

03:19:03.769 --> 03:19:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:06.530 --> 03:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
expiration time so thank you for that
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
question I I think there's two two
 
03:19:10.969 --> 03:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
changes that we're looking at here right
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
there's one for the July 1st corrective
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
action plan okay that one still has
 
03:19:17.750 --> 03:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions still unknown okay
 
03:19:19.550 --> 03:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
so we could do a pilot program just
 
03:19:22.429 --> 03:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
focused on that okay to help understand
 
03:19:24.110 --> 03:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
what it would mean to do a good pilot
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
program we need to involve more families
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
and more people with disabilities in
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
here right that's part of our RSA 171
 
03:19:32.269 --> 03:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
law state law is to involve people with
 
03:19:32.279 --> 03:19:33.349 align:start position:0%
law state law is to involve people with
disabilities

03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
03:19:35.090 --> 03:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
okay we need to Define what the success
 
03:19:37.610 --> 03:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
criteria are what are the uh you know
 
03:19:41.809 --> 03:19:41.819 align:start position:0%
what's the um what I write down uh
 
03:19:45.290 --> 03:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh boy quality metrics success criteria
 
03:19:47.929 --> 03:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
and so on and then the follow-on is post
 
03:19:50.510 --> 03:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
July there's these non-mandatory changes
 
03:19:53.450 --> 03:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
that BDS would like to make and we need
 
03:19:55.969 --> 03:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
to involve families in that and I think
 
03:19:58.190 --> 03:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
we do have time to develop a better plan
 
03:20:00.950 --> 03:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
for what's going to go on post-july and
 
03:20:04.130 --> 03:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
what the a pilot program would be
 
03:20:07.730 --> 03:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
follow up so you're really proposing
 
03:20:07.740 --> 03:20:08.630 align:start position:0%
follow up so you're really proposing
um

03:20:08.630 --> 03:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:11.450 --> 03:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
at least two pilots one with the
 
03:20:13.309 --> 03:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
immediate issues with the immediate
 
03:20:15.290 --> 03:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
deadline of July 1st and then another
 
03:20:15.300 --> 03:20:16.750 align:start position:0%
deadline of July 1st and then another
one

03:20:16.750 --> 03:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:20:20.750 --> 03:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
that using feedback from families will
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
address a broader group of issues yeah
 
03:20:24.530 --> 03:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I think you know what I'm
 
03:20:27.230 --> 03:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
proposing is look at the situations in
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
terms of what is required from a federal
 
03:20:31.010 --> 03:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
compliance point of view
 
03:20:34.250 --> 03:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
okay Implement those and then the the
 
03:20:37.429 --> 03:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
proposed broader changes keep that
 
03:20:37.439 --> 03:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
proposed broader changes keep that
separate

03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
separate
 
03:20:42.170 --> 03:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Merchant thank
 
03:20:43.370 --> 03:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
I think what I'm hearing and I want to
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
be clear about this instead of a pilot
 
03:20:53.570 --> 03:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
program is a design program to basically
 
03:20:56.090 --> 03:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
design something correct
 
03:20:58.429 --> 03:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
correctly that involves all the
 
03:21:01.070 --> 03:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including BDS
 
03:21:03.769 --> 03:21:03.779 align:start position:0%
and once we have the design program in
 
03:21:06.050 --> 03:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
place then we can do a pilot
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
but to think step one is getting the
 
03:21:10.610 --> 03:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
design built to begin with is that kind
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
of what I'm hearing
 
03:21:14.570 --> 03:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
I I think so I mean the design is in
 
03:21:17.150 --> 03:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
progress okay I mean it's it is and
 
03:21:18.830 --> 03:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's the concern is there are a lot
 
03:21:21.290 --> 03:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
of unknowns in this design but still in
 
03:21:23.929 --> 03:21:23.939 align:start position:0%
in software one of the things you do is
 
03:21:25.610 --> 03:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
you develop what your success criteria
 
03:21:26.750 --> 03:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
is you develop your less set of
 
03:21:28.370 --> 03:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
requirements what is this thing going to
 
03:21:30.590 --> 03:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
look like okay and then you implement
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
your your test plan or your beta program
 
03:21:34.490 --> 03:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
pilot program to make sure that you've
 
03:21:36.050 --> 03:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
met your requirements
 
03:21:38.450 --> 03:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
follow up please hello thank you so
 
03:21:39.650 --> 03:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
basically at this point in time to
 
03:21:42.290 --> 03:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
understand the software analogy we're
 
03:21:43.969 --> 03:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
still designing the software we haven't
 
03:21:46.610 --> 03:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
got to the beta test yet
 
03:21:48.349 --> 03:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
I I would probably characterize it that
 
03:21:49.969 --> 03:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
way yeah thank you
 
03:21:52.969 --> 03:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:22:01.130 --> 03:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
they also signed up to testify is uh Amy
 
03:22:09.410 --> 03:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
joard I believe it is uh from Concord
 
03:22:10.670 --> 03:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure I didn't pronounce that
 
03:22:15.410 --> 03:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:17.210 --> 03:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh you asked for six minutes ma'am we
 
03:22:19.070 --> 03:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
really need you to stick to you know
 
03:22:21.230 --> 03:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's pretty as much as you can
 
03:22:23.929 --> 03:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
nearly close to three I can hear you oh
 
03:22:25.730 --> 03:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
yeah you need to push the hit the button
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
03:22:29.690 --> 03:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
okay that's better
 
03:22:31.130 --> 03:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
um yes I will do my best to stick to
 
03:22:33.889 --> 03:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
that time frame thank you for allowing
 
03:22:36.290 --> 03:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
me to testify here this morning my name
 
03:22:38.630 --> 03:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
is Amy Gerard I am from Concord and I
 
03:22:40.550 --> 03:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
live with my family and a daughter with
 
03:22:41.929 --> 03:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
a disability
 
03:22:44.630 --> 03:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
I am here to oppose
 
03:22:44.640 --> 03:22:46.429 align:start position:0%
I am here to oppose
hbo608

03:22:46.429 --> 03:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
hbo608
 
03:22:49.190 --> 03:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
I represent other family members and
 
03:22:51.469 --> 03:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
individuals served with the sorry I
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
represent individuals that have come
 
03:22:54.120 --> 03:22:55.190 align:start position:0%
represent individuals that have come
together

03:22:55.190 --> 03:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:22:57.950 --> 03:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill because we don't
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill in as the way it
 
03:23:03.710 --> 03:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
is written really speaks to the issues
 
03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
of the pilot program and how this should
 
03:23:09.650 --> 03:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
be implemented
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bureau of Developmental
 
03:23:13.250 --> 03:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
Services has been under a CMS corrective
 
03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
action plan since 2016. specific to the
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and direct bill as
 
03:23:19.809 --> 03:23:19.819 align:start position:0%
noted in a
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
2017 position paper from Sydney the
 
03:23:24.530 --> 03:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
scope of the CMS cap regarding the
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
centers for Medicare and Medicaid
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
services has determined that New
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's service system does not
 
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
comply with these rules and as a result
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%

deadline of July 1st 2023 the
 
03:23:46.429 --> 03:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
legislation as proposed does not comply
 
03:23:49.010 --> 03:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
with these Federal deadlines
 
03:23:51.170 --> 03:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
the Redden legislation states the
 
03:23:53.090 --> 03:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
purpose of the pilot program will be to
 
03:23:55.190 --> 03:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
test with Alvarez and Marcel Public

comprehensive rollout of the redesign
 
03:24:02.090 --> 03:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
program however these concepts are not
 
03:24:04.130 --> 03:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
clear and the quality educators are not
 
03:24:06.229 --> 03:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
available or transparent
 
03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
Additionally the legislation provides
 
03:24:09.710 --> 03:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
language that the data points being
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
gathered to determine positive or
 
03:24:13.610 --> 03:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
negative consequences are based on
 
03:24:13.620 --> 03:24:14.750 align:start position:0%
negative consequences are based on
topics

03:24:14.750 --> 03:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
topics
 
03:24:18.469 --> 03:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
such as but not limited to mandated and

03:24:29.929 --> 03:24:29.939 align:start position:0%
the language continues to allow any
 
03:24:31.429 --> 03:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
additional change that may be included
 
03:24:33.170 --> 03:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
in the pilot program without mentioning
 
03:24:35.389 --> 03:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
scope or review and to me that is very
 
03:24:35.399 --> 03:24:37.309 align:start position:0%
scope or review and to me that is very
dangerous

03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
03:24:39.710 --> 03:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
the timeline as someone had mentioned
 
03:24:42.110 --> 03:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
earlier and I'll be brief the timeline
 
03:24:44.510 --> 03:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
is of great concern there are numerous
 
03:24:46.490 --> 03:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
concerns the timeline as proposed and in
 
03:24:47.809 --> 03:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
this the date and time requirements
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
contradict each other while
 
03:24:52.010 --> 03:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
contradicting the CMS cap deadlines
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
within no later date data of July 1st
 
03:24:56.690 --> 03:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
this leaves two to three area agencies
 
03:24:58.969 --> 03:24:58.979 align:start position:0%
with less than four months if this
 
03:25:00.650 --> 03:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
legislation is accepted as written at
 
03:25:02.929 --> 03:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
the date of this letter to implement a
 
03:25:05.210 --> 03:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
net new pilot program closeout current
 
03:25:07.670 --> 03:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
programming inform consumers families
 
03:25:09.110 --> 03:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
and vendors and create sustainable
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
standardized data points together for
 
03:25:13.729 --> 03:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
analysis the pilot scope intends to have
 
03:25:16.429 --> 03:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
data for a minimum of 10 months however
 
03:25:18.110 --> 03:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
the pilot analysis should be publicly
 
03:25:21.290 --> 03:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
available by March 1st 2024 a mere eight
 
03:25:22.729 --> 03:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
to nine months when the pilot is
 
03:25:22.739 --> 03:25:23.690 align:start position:0%
to nine months when the pilot is
initiated

03:25:23.690 --> 03:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
initiated
 
03:25:25.849 --> 03:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
as we know that data analysis must begin
 
03:25:27.889 --> 03:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
before a public report can be produced
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
we would anticipate the data analysis
 
03:25:33.370 --> 03:25:33.380 align:start position:0%
I hear the timer
 
03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
the data analysis
 
03:25:38.570 --> 03:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
would engage 30 to 60 days before the
 
03:25:40.429 --> 03:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
reporting deadline as proposed this
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
creates a slimming of the data
 
03:25:43.070 --> 03:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
collection time frame closer to seven
 
03:25:44.929 --> 03:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
months of data four are shorter than the
 
03:25:46.849 --> 03:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
10-month minimum requested
 
03:25:48.769 --> 03:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
and I know and I appreciate that I am
 
03:25:50.210 --> 03:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
running out of time and I just wouldn't
 
03:25:53.210 --> 03:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
like to indulge you for one more thing
 
03:25:56.030 --> 03:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
I know that the Bureau of Department of
 
03:25:58.030 --> 03:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
Health and excuse me the Bureau of
 
03:26:00.530 --> 03:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services has worked really
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
hard with families and consumers over
 
03:26:04.969 --> 03:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
the last years to make sure that our
 
03:26:06.530 --> 03:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
voices are heard
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
I am very concerned that people are not
 
03:26:11.450 --> 03:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
coming forward because they are afraid
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
they are afraid of retaliation from the
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
area agencies they are afraid that their
 
03:26:17.830 --> 03:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
services will be cut they are afraid
 
03:26:20.990 --> 03:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
that the Mantra of going back to Laconia
 
03:26:23.210 --> 03:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
is true
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
I do not hear that from the Department
 
03:26:30.050 --> 03:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
I hear Innovation I hear appropriate
 
03:26:32.510 --> 03:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
systems change and I hear that they
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
really want to be able to move forward
 
03:26:36.349 --> 03:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
and make sure that families and
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
individuals particularly individuals
 
03:26:40.010 --> 03:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities are
 
03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
served in the way that they need to be
 
03:26:43.429 --> 03:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
served and have a full and robust life
 
03:26:45.830 --> 03:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
full of services that provide a good and
 
03:26:47.690 --> 03:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
decent quality of life
 
03:26:50.769 --> 03:26:50.779 align:start position:0%
I am proposed I am opposed to this pilot
 
03:26:54.050 --> 03:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe that this will
 
03:26:56.210 --> 03:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
solve anything
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
hey thank you questions
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean
 
03:27:03.530 --> 03:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:27:08.090 --> 03:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
um we we took some testimony a little
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
bit earlier
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
um about the suggestion that maybe we
 
03:27:13.190 --> 03:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
would go forward
 
03:27:15.889 --> 03:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
um with the redesign on the the
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
corrective action elements of it but
 
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
maybe pilot the a m portion
 
03:27:25.010 --> 03:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
um if the bill were amended to modify
 
03:27:27.650 --> 03:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
the scope in some way would you is that
 
03:27:30.349 --> 03:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
something you think you could support
 
03:27:33.229 --> 03:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
let me see if I understand you correctly
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
um so you're saying that we wouldn't the
 
03:27:37.070 --> 03:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill that proposed changes would
 
03:27:39.530 --> 03:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
implement the corrective action plan and
 
03:27:40.969 --> 03:27:40.979 align:start position:0%
direct bill
 
03:27:43.130 --> 03:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying yeah it's my
 
03:27:44.570 --> 03:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
understanding from the testimony that
 
03:27:45.950 --> 03:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's just two elements of this
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
there's we got to get the the CMS uh the
 
03:27:52.010 --> 03:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
corrective action part done and there's
 
03:27:53.690 --> 03:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
a hard date on that and then there's the
 
03:27:56.870 --> 03:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
a m recommendations so if you were to
 
03:28:00.830 --> 03:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
push forward with the one element of it
 
03:28:00.840 --> 03:28:01.490 align:start position:0%
push forward with the one element of it
um

03:28:01.490 --> 03:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:03.170 --> 03:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
because you have to because the time
 
03:28:05.929 --> 03:28:05.939 align:start position:0%
constraints and then do the pilot on the
 
03:28:08.030 --> 03:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
a m recommendation so you're basically
 
03:28:10.309 --> 03:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
dividing it up
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
would that be something you could
 
03:28:14.690 --> 03:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
support I think if the scope was clear
 
03:28:18.290 --> 03:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:21.410 --> 03:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
03:28:27.290 --> 03:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
um you said something in your testimony
 
03:28:31.429 --> 03:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
that was a concern of mine that I think
 
03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
has gone away but you mentioned the
 
03:28:35.870 --> 03:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
concern that programs would be suspended
 
03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
while the pilot program was going on my
 
03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
understanding from everything I've heard
 
03:28:43.130 --> 03:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
is that's not going to happen but the
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
plans that BDS has created will be
 
03:28:47.389 --> 03:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
suspended indefinitely not the actual
 
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
programs am I wrong about that I think
 
03:28:53.150 --> 03:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
that it is very unclear within this bill
 
03:28:55.250 --> 03:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
is what I'm going back to and there's a
 
03:28:58.190 --> 03:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
what I was saying about the fear is that
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
there is a general Community fear of the
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
redesign itself
 
03:29:03.840 --> 03:29:05.389 align:start position:0%
redesign itself
because

03:29:05.389 --> 03:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:29:07.550 --> 03:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
people are afraid that what the redesign
 
03:29:09.889 --> 03:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
means is that they we are all going back
 
03:29:12.530 --> 03:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
to the days of Laconia state school and
 
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
nobody wants that that is not what I'm
 
03:29:16.610 --> 03:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
hearing from the Department however that
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
is not what I have been seeing in the
 
03:29:22.010 --> 03:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
stakeholder meetings that have been vast
 
03:29:25.309 --> 03:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
I am hearing from many stakeholders who
 
03:29:27.650 --> 03:29:27.660 align:start position:0%
are afraid to come forward that they do
 
03:29:29.330 --> 03:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
feel heard by the department
 
03:29:31.729 --> 03:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
and they are incredibly excited about
 
03:29:35.450 --> 03:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
this redesign because it will allow for
 
03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
broader Services
 
03:29:39.170 --> 03:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
individualized services that will
 
03:29:42.710 --> 03:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:44.570 --> 03:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
you mentioned Department which
 
03:29:46.250 --> 03:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
department sorry Department of Health
 
03:29:48.769 --> 03:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
and Human Services CDs
 
03:29:52.250 --> 03:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
see no other questions okay thank you
 
03:29:59.210 --> 03:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:01.309 --> 03:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
and the final person signed up to
 
03:30:04.790 --> 03:30:04.800 align:start position:0%

challenges of programs as they develop
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
and providing a doorway of communication
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
from those uh in in the field providing

intent of generating Cooperative

collaboration to achieve consensus
 
04:08:08.330 --> 04:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
with new programs coming on the table
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
and being reviewed is to have those who
 
04:08:13.370 --> 04:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
were then committed to meeting what
 
04:08:16.250 --> 04:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
those programs require to be part of
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
their generation
 
04:08:22.969 --> 04:08:22.979 align:start position:0%

04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
exists and and having a a doorway open
 
04:08:36.650 --> 04:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
between the uh Department of Health and
 
04:08:38.809 --> 04:08:38.819 align:start position:0%

you've heard already on the previous two
 
04:09:06.889 --> 04:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
uh two bills this is uh one conduit that
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh we hope to add to and to provide as a
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
solid resource that once programs are
 
04:09:15.600 --> 04:09:16.729 align:start position:0%

physical but the intellectual commitment
 
04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
to meet the requirements because they

the meetings have the challenges of how
 
04:11:29.570 --> 04:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
they can get to the meeting is to win to
 
04:11:31.250 --> 04:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is just like we have
 
04:11:34.070 --> 04:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
here a zoom connection for these
 
04:11:35.809 --> 04:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
meetings and that they would be
 
04:11:37.729 --> 04:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
considered part of the Quorum that's
 
04:11:41.330 --> 04:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
needed when policies are voted on is
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
that it's done by by a majority as per
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
statute that we have uh in here but
 
04:11:48.769 --> 04:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
that's that is uh ultimately
 
04:11:51.410 --> 04:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
as you wait we threw read through this
 
04:11:54.110 --> 04:11:54.120 align:start position:0%

black letter hope the copies did show
that

04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:00.650 --> 04:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh is those are the additions and to

uh is those are the additions and to
facilitate

04:12:02.450 --> 04:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
facilitate
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
functional participation by the council
 
04:12:08.330 --> 04:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
members in developing in collaboration
 
04:12:10.849 --> 04:12:10.859 align:start position:0%
with the department policies and
 
04:12:13.849 --> 04:12:13.859 align:start position:0%
regulations and services that will be
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
supported once passed and because
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
they're meeting exactly what has been
 
04:12:23.870 --> 04:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
received in in overview and testimony at
 
04:12:25.250 --> 04:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
the meetings that they have in working
 
04:12:27.110 --> 04:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
with the Department who's doing the work
 
04:12:29.150 --> 04:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
and putting these programs together as
 
04:12:31.370 --> 04:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
stated earlier to meet the funding
 
04:12:33.290 --> 04:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
through whether it's CMS or state
 
04:12:35.330 --> 04:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
funding there's qualifications needed
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
but meeting the the broad uh challenges
 
04:12:43.130 --> 04:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
and requirements uh if if you don't live
 
04:12:45.290 --> 04:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
the life then you're not going to know
 
04:12:47.570 --> 04:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
what it is and those requirements are
 
04:12:50.150 --> 04:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
brought together by this by this Council
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
and it's to facilitate what they bring
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
to the table will be part of the
 
04:12:59.210 --> 04:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
policies ultimately approved and and
 
04:13:01.250 --> 04:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
offered what ultimately comes back here
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
to to Health and Human Services
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
04:13:08.750 --> 04:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
04:13:11.210 --> 04:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
McMahon for being here today would these
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
change do you think that these changes
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
would solve or at least significantly
 
04:13:16.969 --> 04:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
address the concerns we heard this
 
04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
morning about people in the community
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:26.269 --> 04:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
I well the short short answer is yes I
 
04:13:28.969 --> 04:13:28.979 align:start position:0%
do when there's a voice I can speak
 
04:13:31.370 --> 04:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
alone in the woods or I can you know
 
04:13:34.490 --> 04:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
speak in front of to to get the
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
collaborative cooperation and that's
 
04:13:38.750 --> 04:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
working together and and it's having
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
here where you where you will be given
 
04:13:43.370 --> 04:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
that that opportunity but you've got to
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
show up
 
04:13:46.969 --> 04:13:46.979 align:start position:0%
and and there was there's the continuity
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
that is offered uh that does exist but
 
04:13:51.790 --> 04:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
what was not taking place was more
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
participation and recognition of the
 
04:13:56.510 --> 04:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
contribution and that contribution is to
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
put uh the uh like it says in here a
 
04:14:01.090 --> 04:14:01.100 align:start position:0%
council member on the decision-making
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
capacity of
 
04:14:07.729 --> 04:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
um contracts or Services uh as being
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
spent after we have uh voted for funding
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
here in the finance
 
04:14:15.110 --> 04:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
hello and would you be opposed to
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
changing it to being enacted upon
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
passage so that the script has a better
 
04:14:19.969 --> 04:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
voice going forward
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
and faster right now it says 60 days
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
after passage so if we do this amendment
 
04:14:27.830 --> 04:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it with it upon Passage
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
well I I uh well I'm I'm one that wants
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everyone's fully
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
loaded before that they'll support this
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
and also I am one that does believe and
 
04:14:38.450 --> 04:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be funny let's do it
 
04:14:41.090 --> 04:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
while we're young so it's it's yes the
 
04:14:42.830 --> 04:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
if the if the committee is in support of
 
04:14:46.010 --> 04:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
that I sure sure am and and I would
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
offer that those who I've spoken to and
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
others will testify on uh on the service
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
Council that uh and I haven't asked him
 
04:14:55.370 --> 04:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
that it's just that we need this done
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
now and that's why I was honor honored
 
04:15:00.530 --> 04:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
to be able to offer this bill for your
 
04:15:03.710 --> 04:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
consideration and support
 
04:15:06.410 --> 04:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:15:08.809 --> 04:15:08.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative McKay
 
04:15:11.150 --> 04:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:15:11.160 --> 04:15:14.389 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
representative

04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:17.269 --> 04:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
you think it's a criteria that the
 
04:15:19.610 --> 04:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
members of this Council be young so that
 
04:15:22.490 --> 04:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
they can do things in the early part of
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:29.450 --> 04:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
I mean do they need to be young I think
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
they should be well no they need to be
 
04:15:33.790 --> 04:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
aggressively mature
 
04:15:36.530 --> 04:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
and uh age does not play a role there
 
04:15:38.689 --> 04:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh communicated with manners
 
04:15:42.110 --> 04:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
and do the work but whether you're um
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
up there in age or not uh if you're
 
04:15:46.250 --> 04:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
living the life that's what gets people
 
04:15:49.370 --> 04:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
really motivated and this is a Avenue
 
04:15:52.610 --> 04:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
where you can speak and people and those
 
04:15:54.110 --> 04:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
who are there will can understand and
 
04:15:56.210 --> 04:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
talk on the correct language and then
 
04:15:57.410 --> 04:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
working with our Department of Health
 
04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is to continue for us
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and this is my bias to
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
lead the way in home and community-based
 
04:16:06.170 --> 04:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
care and that's what what we need now
 
04:16:08.030 --> 04:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's whether those are willing to put it
 
04:16:09.110 --> 04:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the time
 
04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
and as I learned from your guidance many
 
04:16:15.110 --> 04:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
years ago I said you need to show up
 
04:16:18.410 --> 04:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that the uh
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
was that this member often says we
 
04:16:23.870 --> 04:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
should vote for this while we're still
 
04:16:28.130 --> 04:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
young and and get the work done and I
 
04:16:29.809 --> 04:16:29.819 align:start position:0%
just want to be sure that you were
 
04:16:32.450 --> 04:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
applying that to this legislation as
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
well thank you yes I was waiting for you
 
04:16:36.610 --> 04:16:36.620 align:start position:0%
to finally say you supported yes
 
04:16:39.530 --> 04:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
it took a while instead of land you had
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
a question uh no oh I'm sorry oh sorry
 
04:16:44.570 --> 04:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
oh yes okay I'm representative Cushman
 
04:16:46.490 --> 04:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:16:49.010 --> 04:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
being here and for taking my question
 
04:16:53.570 --> 04:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I I I believe that I like this
 
04:16:53.580 --> 04:16:55.010 align:start position:0%
um I I I believe that I like this
amendment

04:16:55.010 --> 04:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:16:57.950 --> 04:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
um I do have concerns about one section
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's on page three
 
04:17:02.150 --> 04:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
um it says that the meeting shall be
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
open to the public subject to the
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
provisions of rsa91a on online 23 and
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
24. but then
 
04:17:11.809 --> 04:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
um and then you define the Quorum but
 
04:17:14.750 --> 04:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
91a does not permit remote
 
04:17:17.809 --> 04:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
um members who are attending to be a
 
04:17:20.210 --> 04:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
part of the Quorum or to vote and so
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
this would be a precedent being set that
 
04:17:25.849 --> 04:17:25.859 align:start position:0%
has never been in our state to my
 
04:17:25.859 --> 04:17:26.750 align:start position:0%
has never been in our state to my
knowledge

04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
and um no it looks like I have some
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
feedback from the other committee
 
04:17:30.960 --> 04:17:32.450 align:start position:0%
feedback from the other committee
members

04:17:32.450 --> 04:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon is it is it not
 
04:17:42.170 --> 04:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
true that under the first of all there
 
04:17:45.769 --> 04:17:45.779 align:start position:0%
is 91a yes and that we have any number
 
04:17:48.349 --> 04:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
of exceptions to 91a that are built into
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
either 91a itself or everywhere else in
 
04:17:54.250 --> 04:17:54.260 align:start position:0%
the statutes
 
04:17:57.170 --> 04:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
for various things that are not that
 
04:17:59.689 --> 04:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
ought to be on under 91a under its plain
 
04:18:01.309 --> 04:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
language but we have accepted them
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
confidential records for example is that
 
04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
true yeah and yes yes ma'am and then I'm
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
if I may I have a series I'm in attorney
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
mode if I may Mr chairman
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
um is it
 
04:18:18.490 --> 04:18:18.500 align:start position:0%
um also not true that 91a right now
 
04:18:21.550 --> 04:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
permits remote participation
 
04:18:25.309 --> 04:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
when a quorum is present in the room
 
04:18:28.429 --> 04:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
other members May participate remotely
 
04:18:30.830 --> 04:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
is that true if you know that's my end
 
04:18:32.510 --> 04:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding which is why
 
04:18:34.670 --> 04:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's in in the billas of recommendation
 
04:18:38.210 --> 04:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
and then finally Mr chairman uh and
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that for purposes of a
 
04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
quorum if we are to involve members of
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
this community and their caregivers
 
04:18:47.760 --> 04:18:49.670 align:start position:0%
this community and their caregivers
meaningfully

04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
meaningfully
 
04:18:52.370 --> 04:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
with all the issues that they may have
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
with respect to their medical care and
 
04:18:56.210 --> 04:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
their transport and their ability to get
 
04:18:59.809 --> 04:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
to meetings that we need this exception
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
like all the other exceptions to 91a in
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
order for there to be the kind of
 
04:19:08.950 --> 04:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
meaningful participation
 
04:19:12.050 --> 04:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
04:19:15.830 --> 04:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
the community and their caregivers so
 
04:19:19.010 --> 04:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose for this exemption
 
04:19:20.689 --> 04:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
well I want to check if you're a sponsor
 
04:19:22.370 --> 04:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
of the bill with me that sure sounded
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
like it
 
04:19:23.279 --> 04:19:24.530 align:start position:0%
like it
uh

04:19:24.530 --> 04:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
yes Joanna uh at the the uh the issue is
 
04:19:29.389 --> 04:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
that you know you're exactly correct I
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate your very knowledgeable
 
04:19:34.370 --> 04:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
expression on that there's there's the
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
law then there's the application of the
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
law and it's it's and it's for our
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
citizens and the protection of our
 
04:19:43.010 --> 04:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
citizens so that's why it's here and
 
04:19:45.710 --> 04:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a subset of our
 
04:19:45.720 --> 04:19:47.090 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a subset of our
population

04:19:47.090 --> 04:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:19:49.130 --> 04:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
that still can participate but
 
04:19:51.410 --> 04:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
physically can't uh may not get there
 
04:19:53.929 --> 04:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
and this allows them to participate
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'll thank you
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
for taking the question it's good to see
 
04:20:02.689 --> 04:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
you back
 
04:20:05.630 --> 04:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
in regards to the Quorum and what we
 
04:20:07.010 --> 04:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
just heard from representative Weber
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
many of the individuals may be on this
 
04:20:09.359 --> 04:20:10.790 align:start position:0%
many of the individuals may be on this
Council

04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
Council
 
04:20:13.370 --> 04:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
could have transportation issues
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
would it be better to have an exemption
 
04:20:18.050 --> 04:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
to 91a so there's not a requirement for
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:29.150 --> 04:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
this isn't compliance with 91a 91a
 
04:20:31.570 --> 04:20:31.580 align:start position:0%
requires a physical Quorum
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative did you have an answer
 
04:20:35.570 --> 04:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
for that or
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
04:20:40.969 --> 04:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
um I hosted another bill House Bill 308
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
which deals uh exactly with this
 
04:20:46.910 --> 04:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
initially it started out to be a bill
 
04:20:50.210 --> 04:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
allowing the rare disease Council to
 
04:20:52.130 --> 04:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
meet but we also added in the
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
disabilities and then there was an
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that made it a much broader
 
04:20:59.570 --> 04:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
um Bill and it has passed through
 
04:21:02.090 --> 04:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
Judiciary so it's got you know two more
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
three more steps to do but would it was
 
04:21:07.849 --> 04:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
with your Council exactly in mind that
 
04:21:12.110 --> 04:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
that was initiated and it would allow
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
um you needed a third of the membership
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
to be in a physical location but that
 
04:21:19.729 --> 04:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
the rest of the people online could
 
04:21:22.729 --> 04:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
count as the Quorum right so it that's a
 
04:21:25.210 --> 04:21:25.220 align:start position:0%
fix if that goes through
 
04:21:28.010 --> 04:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:21:28.020 --> 04:21:30.729 align:start position:0%
other questions
yes

04:21:30.729 --> 04:21:30.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up again okay
 
04:21:35.809 --> 04:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions
 
04:21:41.110 --> 04:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
that sun is not I do not have a question
 
04:21:44.809 --> 04:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
seeing you look into the glare of if
 
04:21:46.370 --> 04:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
this is bothering people I'll close it
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
we open the blind we open the curtains
 
04:21:51.490 --> 04:21:51.500 align:start position:0%
so that air could come in that's fine
 
04:21:53.750 --> 04:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
because the glare isn't helping my
 
04:21:56.150 --> 04:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
eyesight right now okay I'll close
 
04:22:00.050 --> 04:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman yes if I may um uh
 
04:22:06.349 --> 04:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
Charlie McMahon okay yeah just to add
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
one comment there the intent here was
 
04:22:11.330 --> 04:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
not to facilitate uh non
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
-physical presence for folks not to come
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
to these to this meeting it's
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
specifically was is targeting
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
the individuals who can't get their due
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
to their physical challenges so so it's
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
not to abuse the uh any intent of
 
04:22:27.120 --> 04:22:29.389 align:start position:0%
not to abuse the uh any intent of
transparency

04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
when you're having a meeting or or to
 
04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
play with a quorum requirement when very
 
04:22:36.530 --> 04:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
important decisions are being made
 
04:22:38.090 --> 04:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%

DHHS oversight committee and I am past

chairman of Health Human Services and
 
04:24:04.490 --> 04:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs committee when I first
 
04:24:07.250 --> 04:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
got to Concord I decided to adopt the
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
needs of the DD Community as one of my
 
04:24:13.550 --> 04:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
places of interest and have been active
 
04:24:16.849 --> 04:24:16.859 align:start position:0%
in this work for going on to seven years
 
04:24:20.929 --> 04:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
in my work as a part-time executive
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
director of a family
 
04:24:25.969 --> 04:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
Medical Practice Center
 
04:24:28.189 --> 04:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
I know
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
this part I know we have served many DD
 
04:24:34.610 --> 04:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
patients when the department started to
 
04:24:37.250 --> 04:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
consider a redesign of the Bureau of
 
04:24:40.010 --> 04:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services I did some
 
04:24:42.610 --> 04:24:42.620 align:start position:0%
shuttle dis
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
diplomacy among department leaders the
 
04:24:49.370 --> 04:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
area agencies and those with DD people
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
at home while we didn't come to any
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
conclusions it was apparent that more
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
work has to be done in order to create a
 
04:24:59.689 --> 04:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
system that both serves the department
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
and the recipients in my opinion we
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
still aren't there yet I believe the
 
04:25:09.530 --> 04:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
people working at DHHS
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
in the area of Developmental disability
 
04:25:15.469 --> 04:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
planning a change in the system are
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
capable and caring not a few of them
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
themselves have DD loved ones
 
04:25:24.410 --> 04:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
I enjoy my time with the department
 
04:25:28.429 --> 04:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
leaders however numbers of stakeholders
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
have indicated their input needs to be
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
welcomed and considered more than has
 
04:25:37.790 --> 04:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
happened to date in my opinion there's
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
still a disconnect the bill before us
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 238 asks for more important
 
04:25:48.290 --> 04:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
more input before any contract is
 
04:25:51.530 --> 04:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
finalized in my opinion this is most
 
04:25:53.649 --> 04:25:53.659 align:start position:0%
justifi justified
 
04:25:55.729 --> 04:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
I could
 
04:25:58.490 --> 04:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
live with any of the three bills you are
 
04:25:59.950 --> 04:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
considering today
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
608 317 or this one as long as the
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
transition to a two-tier waiver is
 
04:26:11.750 --> 04:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
delayed so further conversation and
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
collaboration can take place thank you
 
04:26:17.210 --> 04:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:21.950 --> 04:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:23.649 --> 04:26:23.659 align:start position:0%
no I know
 
04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
that was kind of a rhetorical that was
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
kind of perhaps not that was meant to be
 
04:26:32.809 --> 04:26:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:34.729 --> 04:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh the cleric wants a copy of that
 
04:26:34.739 --> 04:26:41.210 align:start position:0%
uh the cleric wants a copy of that
testimony

04:26:41.210 --> 04:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative

04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
04:27:10.729 --> 04:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
my name is Melissa Nemeth I am the
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the Bureau of
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services no one's ever
 
04:27:17.450 --> 04:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
told me I was quiet before
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and and Robert Moore from the
 
04:27:20.809 --> 04:27:20.819 align:start position:0%
Department is here with me as well um
 
04:27:23.330 --> 04:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
he's going to speak to the piece
 
04:27:25.130 --> 04:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
relative to Contracting while I'm going
 
04:27:27.950 --> 04:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
to address the remaining elements of the
 
04:27:30.530 --> 04:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
bill the department is not taking a
 
04:27:32.510 --> 04:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
position on the bill today but did want
 
04:27:34.490 --> 04:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
to provide information and point out
 
04:27:36.649 --> 04:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
some concerns that we do have in the way
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
that the bill is currently written I
 
04:27:42.050 --> 04:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
think as you've heard you know associate
 
04:27:44.330 --> 04:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner santanello in her testimony
 
04:27:46.849 --> 04:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
this morning the the department very
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
much values the input of all
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders be it those on the quality
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
Council family members area agencies
 
04:27:57.110 --> 04:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
what have you we realize and recognize
 
04:27:59.809 --> 04:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
that they are key components and key
 
04:28:01.429 --> 04:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
contributors to all the work that is
 
04:28:05.330 --> 04:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
done but the this bill appears to move
 
04:28:08.330 --> 04:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
the quality Council more from The
 
04:28:11.450 --> 04:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
Advisory role that they have today into
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
an oversight position and as you're all
 
04:28:17.090 --> 04:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
well aware the department already
 
04:28:19.210 --> 04:28:19.220 align:start position:0%
reports to Health and Human Services
 
04:28:22.729 --> 04:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
oversight on a regular basis and could
 
04:28:25.870 --> 04:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
provide much of this information
 
04:28:28.969 --> 04:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
and I think you are going to hear some
 
04:28:32.269 --> 04:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
testimony today that others you know
 
04:28:34.370 --> 04:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
that are part of the community family
 
04:28:37.250 --> 04:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
members feel perhaps that their
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
feedback is not heard and not listened
 
04:28:40.319 --> 04:28:40.929 align:start position:0%
feedback is not heard and not listened
to

04:28:40.929 --> 04:28:40.939 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:28:43.849 --> 04:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
BDS feels we have a very robust
 
04:28:46.130 --> 04:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement process and an
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
elaborate system for the members of the
 
04:28:50.210 --> 04:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
quality Council specifically to have
 
04:28:52.969 --> 04:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
their voices heard some of the members
 
04:28:54.950 --> 04:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
are very involved in the redesign
 
04:28:56.889 --> 04:28:56.899 align:start position:0%
efforts that are going on and sit on
 
04:28:59.210 --> 04:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
committees that have been established as
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
part of the redesign work there is a
 
04:29:04.370 --> 04:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
member of the Department of Health and
 
04:29:06.769 --> 04:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
Human Services Bureau of Developmental
 
04:29:10.010 --> 04:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
Services who is a member who sits on the
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
quality Council and provides a great
 
04:29:14.929 --> 04:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
deal of information through all of their
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
meetings we respond to requests that we
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
get a vast number of requests for
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
certain data points from the quality
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
Council that we are more than willing to
 
04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
provide and have provided and will
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
continue to do
 
04:29:31.849 --> 04:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
in this bill you know while it may be
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
well intentioned to the extent folks
 
04:29:36.769 --> 04:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
feel they aren't being heard we have
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
some concern learns that there might
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
actually be some unintended negative
 
04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
consequences of this that will be to the
 
04:29:44.570 --> 04:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
detriment of the individuals that are
 
04:29:47.689 --> 04:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
supported it would some of what is in
 
04:29:49.370 --> 04:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
here would significantly impact the
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
ability of the department to conduct its
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
functions and impede the efficient
 
04:29:56.030 --> 04:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
delivery of services to this vulnerable
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.090 --> 04:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
on page three of the bill it requests
 
04:30:08.809 --> 04:30:08.819 align:start position:0%
that or it would require that we seek
 
04:30:11.450 --> 04:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
input solicit input before and
 
04:30:13.130 --> 04:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the council at the
 
04:30:15.429 --> 04:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
initial stages of consideration
 
04:30:19.370 --> 04:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
for any policies it goes on it's a long
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
list and it would seem to and again this
 
04:30:24.290 --> 04:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
could be not the intention of the bill
 
04:30:26.330 --> 04:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
but reading it it seems to be that there
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
would be very little work that the
 
04:30:30.410 --> 04:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental Services could
 
04:30:32.809 --> 04:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
do without soliciting input and again
 
04:30:34.490 --> 04:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
while it's valued
 
04:30:37.250 --> 04:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
if it is required at every level of
 
04:30:40.070 --> 04:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
every move that the department makes
 
04:30:43.550 --> 04:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to be unduly burdensome and
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
prevent the department from doing the
 
04:30:46.729 --> 04:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
important work every day that needs to
 
04:30:48.050 --> 04:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
be done to ensure that these services
 
04:30:54.170 --> 04:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.670 --> 04:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
um sure
 
04:31:01.010 --> 04:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
so it begins on page three line line 37
 
04:31:04.490 --> 04:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to lines one and two
 
04:31:08.330 --> 04:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
x one through six really of page four of
 
04:31:12.170 --> 04:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
the bill and it goes beyond even the
 
04:31:14.689 --> 04:31:14.699 align:start position:0%
areas that the quality council is
 
04:31:16.610 --> 04:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
already charged with receiving
 
04:31:18.649 --> 04:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
information and providing
 
04:31:22.550 --> 04:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations for another concern that
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
the department has is that although this
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee has been and I I hear the
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
timer I'll wrap up
 
04:31:31.969 --> 04:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
um the the quality council is charged in
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
the current statute with providing
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the department and
 
04:31:38.750 --> 04:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
providing an annual report I I will say
 
04:31:42.050 --> 04:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
that the it's my understanding that
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
annual reports have not always been
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
provided on a regular basis in those
 
04:31:48.530 --> 04:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
that I have seen for the last five or
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
four or five years
 
04:31:52.490 --> 04:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
the areas for which they provided
 
04:31:54.290 --> 04:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
recommendations have been with respect
 
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
to administrative rules and the waiver
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
amendments or the waiver renewals
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
primarily and although these are
 
04:32:02.929 --> 04:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
important from this group those are
 
04:32:04.729 --> 04:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
areas that are open to all public
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement so the department
 
04:32:11.090 --> 04:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
has not received to date a lot of
 
04:32:13.370 --> 04:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
information and recommendations from
 
04:32:15.170 --> 04:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
and with that if I could I we had asked
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
for three minutes each if I I don't know
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
if you want to ask questions now and I
 
04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
know Robert has to get to a meeting so
 
04:32:23.570 --> 04:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
maybe if he could provide a testimony
 
04:32:25.849 --> 04:32:25.859 align:start position:0%
before we take any questions
 
04:32:28.250 --> 04:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:32:29.450 --> 04:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
um Robert Moore DHHS contracts and
 
04:32:33.469 --> 04:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
procurement director so I'm here as
 
04:32:35.210 --> 04:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
Melissa said to speak specifically about
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
the impacts on the procurement process
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
of HB 238 I'll be brief just just three
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
key points some current concerns that I
 
04:32:45.170 --> 04:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
have about that we have about this bill
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
and its impacts on our ability to
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
conduct Fair confidential and efficient
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
procurements one we must be in
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
compliance with all relevant statutes
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
related to the current process RSA 21g37
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
actually requires the process to remain
 
04:33:02.450 --> 04:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
confidential so the issuing agency
 
04:33:05.390 --> 04:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
including DHHS is not able to provide
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
any information related to the
 
04:33:08.631 --> 04:33:08.641 align:start position:0%
procurements or contracts from the date
 
04:33:10.670 --> 04:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
a request for proposal closes up until
 
04:33:13.250 --> 04:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
GNC approval so it's click not clear to
 
04:33:14.689 --> 04:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
me that this bill would not put us in
 
04:33:17.769 --> 04:33:17.779 align:start position:0%
conflict with RSA 21g37
 
04:33:20.631 --> 04:33:20.641 align:start position:0%
secondly in relatedly many of the
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
members on this Council would be
 
04:33:25.131 --> 04:33:25.141 align:start position:0%
representatives of organizations that
 
04:33:26.810 --> 04:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
are current vendors and contractors with
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS or potential bidders on some of
 
04:33:31.369 --> 04:33:31.379 align:start position:0%
these requests for proposals so I think
 
04:33:33.529 --> 04:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
there's a real potential here for
 
04:33:35.810 --> 04:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
perceived if not actual conflicts of
 
04:33:38.090 --> 04:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
interest if we're giving a subset of our
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
potential betters the opportunity to
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
give input on the solicitations prior to
 
04:33:44.631 --> 04:33:44.641 align:start position:0%
them being issued
 
04:33:45.949 --> 04:33:45.959 align:start position:0%
um and then just the third point I want
 
04:33:47.631 --> 04:33:47.641 align:start position:0%
to make and sort of echoing a comment
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
that Melissa made I think this is adding
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
another level of bureaucratic review and
 
04:33:54.349 --> 04:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
approval to what is already can be a
 
04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
prolonged process and speaking
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
specifically about the procurement
 
04:34:00.289 --> 04:34:00.299 align:start position:0%
process this could potentially delay our
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
ability to issue these requests for
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
proposals and get contracts to governor
 
04:34:06.769 --> 04:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
and executive Council for approval which
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately could delay the timely
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
delivery of these services so thank you
 
04:34:14.810 --> 04:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you questions yes representative
 
04:34:14.820 --> 04:34:18.769 align:start position:0%
thank you questions yes representative
Weber

04:34:18.769 --> 04:34:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:20.929 --> 04:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
the confidential nature of the
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
Contracting process
 
04:34:26.390 --> 04:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
how onerous would it be for you to
 
04:34:30.369 --> 04:34:30.379 align:start position:0%
involve the council in uh
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
solicit the feedback of the council
 
04:34:36.410 --> 04:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
prior to the RFP stage so when you're
 
04:34:38.631 --> 04:34:38.641 align:start position:0%
developing an RFP
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
surely you would want
 
04:34:42.529 --> 04:34:42.539 align:start position:0%
or what maybe you wouldn't want wouldn't
 
04:34:45.970 --> 04:34:45.980 align:start position:0%
you want feedback from the council
 
04:34:49.970 --> 04:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
as to what the effect of whatever your
 
04:34:51.709 --> 04:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
proposal is is going to be on their
 
04:34:51.719 --> 04:34:54.470 align:start position:0%
proposal is is going to be on their
community

04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:56.330 --> 04:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
so I I think that would raise more the
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
issue of the conflict of interests with
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
potential representatives of
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
organizations that could be potential
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
Bettors on this request for a proposal
 
04:35:05.570 --> 04:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
on these requests for a proposal giving
 
04:35:07.609 --> 04:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
input on you know the selection criteria
 
04:35:09.769 --> 04:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
the eligibility requirements I think
 
04:35:11.631 --> 04:35:11.641 align:start position:0%
there is a way to solicit input from
 
04:35:13.970 --> 04:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
this Council and I'll look to Melissa to
 
04:35:15.650 --> 04:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
speak to this more on the goals or
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
overall objectives of a request for a
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
proposal but the actual input on the
 
04:35:22.131 --> 04:35:22.141 align:start position:0%
document itself could raise those
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
potential perceived conflicts of
 
04:35:23.760 --> 04:35:24.830 align:start position:0%
potential perceived conflicts of
interest

04:35:24.830 --> 04:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:35:27.769 --> 04:35:27.779 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow-up follow-up so what
 
04:35:29.689 --> 04:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
I'm really trying to get at and I think
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
we're maybe saying the same thing but
 
04:35:33.410 --> 04:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time feeling like
 
04:35:34.849 --> 04:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
you're actually responding to my
 
04:35:37.490 --> 04:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:35:37.500 --> 04:35:38.750 align:start position:0%
question is
um

04:35:38.750 --> 04:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:41.390 --> 04:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
isn't there a way and perhaps we have
 
04:35:44.090 --> 04:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
not yet drafted it properly
 
04:35:47.209 --> 04:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
to solicit the input and maybe it exists
 
04:35:51.170 --> 04:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
already but what is the way that you
 
04:35:55.090 --> 04:35:55.100 align:start position:0%
will solicit the input of the community
 
04:35:57.769 --> 04:35:57.779 align:start position:0%
that is and I'm not talking about all
 
04:36:00.289 --> 04:36:00.299 align:start position:0%
you know the community that is the
 
04:36:00.299 --> 04:36:01.869 align:start position:0%
you know the community that is the
recipient

04:36:01.869 --> 04:36:01.879 align:start position:0%
recipient
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the care for one thing and also I
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
understand your concern about conflicts
 
04:36:14.269 --> 04:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
of interest but uh how do you propose to
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
solicit the input from the people who
 
04:36:19.970 --> 04:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
are providing the care because if
 
04:36:22.250 --> 04:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
there's anything we heard in the last
 
04:36:25.869 --> 04:36:25.879 align:start position:0%
four hours of Our Lives it is that
 
04:36:28.730 --> 04:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
neither the community receiving the care
 
04:36:31.250 --> 04:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
nor the providers of the Care feel like
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%
they're adequately being heard
 
04:36:36.170 --> 04:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
let's do you want to take them
 
04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:36:39.230 --> 04:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and I think that
 
04:36:41.570 --> 04:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit tough to
 
04:36:43.551 --> 04:36:43.561 align:start position:0%
um to answer this question in a way
 
04:36:45.650 --> 04:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
because it the department feels that it
 
04:36:47.689 --> 04:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
is providing ample opportunities and
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
receiving the feedback
 
04:36:50.750 --> 04:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and I know that the people that are
 
04:36:52.849 --> 04:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
providing the feedback don't don't feel
 
04:36:54.410 --> 04:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
that that's the case
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
um and so it is a little bit difficult
 
04:36:58.131 --> 04:36:58.141 align:start position:0%
to sit here too I think I would need to
 
04:37:00.650 --> 04:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
take this back and provide a follow-up
 
04:37:02.810 --> 04:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
and speak with our our program folks
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
themselves to see um you know what we
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
might potentially be able to offer uh to
 
04:37:11.390 --> 04:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
answer the question that you've raised
 
04:37:14.810 --> 04:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
I am seeing no other questions
 
04:37:25.209 --> 04:37:25.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.830 --> 04:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.529 --> 04:37:33.539 align:start position:0%
okay you guessed
 
04:37:35.631 --> 04:37:35.641 align:start position:0%
um from quality control
 
04:37:53.810 --> 04:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:59.709 --> 04:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.170 --> 04:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
I have a seat on the quality Council as
 
04:38:05.631 --> 04:38:05.641 align:start position:0%
a family member
 
04:38:09.051 --> 04:38:09.061 align:start position:0%
since its Inception by legislation in
 
04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
2009 the quality Council seats have been
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
filled with people with disabilities
 
04:38:19.490 --> 04:38:19.500 align:start position:0%

at least 51 percent of the members of

the councils are individuals with
 
04:38:33.289 --> 04:38:33.299 align:start position:0%

the ideas and opinions of these men
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%

the bureau does not
 
04:38:55.970 --> 04:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
all of these groups are seated on the
 
04:38:57.650 --> 04:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
quality Council
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
the council is an independent voice
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
which includes a diverse group of
 
04:39:07.131 --> 04:39:07.141 align:start position:0%
stakeholders with various thoughts and
 
04:39:10.429 --> 04:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
opinions the council's advocacy is a
 
04:39:12.730 --> 04:39:12.740 align:start position:0%
result of regular discussions
 
04:39:15.289 --> 04:39:15.299 align:start position:0%
compromises from all the stakeholders
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
this voice is critical
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
the legislation as amended seeks to
 
04:39:26.090 --> 04:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
expand the quality council's ability to
 
04:39:28.970 --> 04:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
influence decisions made by the Bureau
 
04:39:31.970 --> 04:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
of Developmental services and clarifies
 
04:39:34.490 --> 04:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the Bureau of

also the legislation addresses issues
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
that the ability of the quality

04:41:55.610 --> 04:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
04:42:07.320 --> 04:42:08.270 align:start position:0%
taking this question
um

04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:10.190 --> 04:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
this may have been better as to the
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
people who um
 
04:42:14.810 --> 04:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
testified before you but I'll put it up
 
04:42:16.970 --> 04:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
for you for the two of you
 
04:42:18.770 --> 04:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
um there was concern from the Department
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
that this would um
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
give people on the council
 
04:42:25.200 --> 04:42:27.350 align:start position:0%
give people on the council
um

04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:30.170 --> 04:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
these weren't their words but too much
 
04:42:34.128 --> 04:42:34.138 align:start position:0%
power or veto power over many things and
 
04:42:36.530 --> 04:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
tie their hands in a certain way
 
04:42:39.530 --> 04:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
I may have characterized that poorly but
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
um but in any case in the original bill
 
04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
it does say that um
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
the council shall solicit input and make
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations but it also says it will
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
give due deference to the council's
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
input I'm not really sure what give do
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
deference means
 
04:43:01.970 --> 04:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
if that gives them veto power but in any
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
case that part seems to be excluded from
 
04:43:07.368 --> 04:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
the amendment which replaces the whole
 
04:43:09.650 --> 04:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
bill which is my understanding
 
04:43:09.660 --> 04:43:11.990 align:start position:0%
bill which is my understanding
so

04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:15.430 --> 04:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
is your understanding that
 
04:43:18.890 --> 04:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
you will be able to give
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
um feedback about a very broad number of
 
04:43:27.310 --> 04:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
issues including redesign including
 
04:43:31.490 --> 04:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
contracts putting out rfps for contracts
 
04:43:31.500 --> 04:43:33.850 align:start position:0%
contracts putting out rfps for contracts
but

04:43:33.850 --> 04:43:33.860 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:43:37.030 --> 04:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately you will be sharing
 
04:43:39.650 --> 04:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
responsibility for making decisions with
 
04:43:40.730 --> 04:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
04:43:42.830 --> 04:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
or that one will have more
 
04:43:45.050 --> 04:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
responsibility will ultimately have more
 
04:43:49.570 --> 04:43:49.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:52.250 --> 04:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
I think our intent with this is that we
 
04:43:53.930 --> 04:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
would be giving input to the department
 
04:43:55.550 --> 04:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
and then they would be held accountable
 
04:43:57.470 --> 04:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
for responding to that input either to
 
04:43:59.208 --> 04:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
say yes we agree with that or know that
 
04:44:01.128 --> 04:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
we don't in a really thoughtful and
 
04:44:03.230 --> 04:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
thorough process but I think we need the
 
04:44:04.910 --> 04:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision for these things is
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
going to rely with the Department who's
 
04:44:09.530 --> 04:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing the services
 
04:44:12.170 --> 04:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up but the intent is
 
04:44:14.690 --> 04:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
not that you would have veto power over
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
for families and people with
 
04:44:24.050 --> 04:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
disabilities and that they would be
 
04:44:25.730 --> 04:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
responsible for saying well we think it
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
does because of this or we we agree with
 
04:44:30.050 --> 04:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
you this wasn't how we meant it you know
 
04:44:31.310 --> 04:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to have those kinds of
 
04:44:33.410 --> 04:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
discussions that we haven't we haven't
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
felt like we have had in the past back
 
04:44:36.120 --> 04:44:38.270 align:start position:0%
felt like we have had in the past back
in

04:44:38.270 --> 04:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:44:41.330 --> 04:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
so so that this would create more of an
 
04:44:41.340 --> 04:44:43.550 align:start position:0%
so so that this would create more of an
honest

04:44:43.550 --> 04:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
honest
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
um vibrant back and forth in terms of
 
04:44:48.530 --> 04:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
getting to a final solution right
 
04:44:50.930 --> 04:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative Leon um
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you both
 
04:44:53.930 --> 04:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the intent of this but
 
04:44:58.010 --> 04:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
it looks like I don't know if there's a
 
04:45:00.410 --> 04:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
certain minimum level of change at which
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
something below a certain level is
 
04:45:04.730 --> 04:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
necessary to come to the committee that
 
04:45:07.430 --> 04:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
come to the council and which decisions
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
are just those day-to-day operations and
 
04:45:11.330 --> 04:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
I think trying to get a handle on that
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
would be helpful for us so that we can
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not
 
04:45:17.330 --> 04:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
crossing the line in the wrong place so
 
04:45:18.590 --> 04:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
that then it needs to come back and get
 
04:45:21.230 --> 04:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
Revisited so could you help with that
 
04:45:21.240 --> 04:45:23.810 align:start position:0%
Revisited so could you help with that
yeah

04:45:23.810 --> 04:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:29.208 --> 04:45:29.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can assure the quality that
 
04:45:32.040 --> 04:45:32.750 align:start position:0%
so that we can assure the quality that
is

04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:45:34.970 --> 04:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
happening to the families
 
04:45:37.610 --> 04:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
and many of the members are family
 
04:45:40.010 --> 04:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
members whether they hold an agency seat
 
04:45:43.010 --> 04:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
or not so
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
not the day-to-day that we're concerned
 
04:45:47.810 --> 04:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
with with the redesign it's a different
 
04:45:50.570 --> 04:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
story right but what we're asking the
 
04:45:53.510 --> 04:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
bureau to do be is transparent with it
 
04:45:56.330 --> 04:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
the entity that was created to assure
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
quality for families
 
04:46:00.830 --> 04:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
and it's a communication
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
thing and you know you what you might
 
04:46:07.970 --> 04:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
describe as we're talking to the
 
04:46:10.250 --> 04:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
families and the families are telling us
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
no they're not
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
so we have to come to some agreement and
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
some understanding and that takes a
 
04:46:21.530 --> 04:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
conversation a transparent conversation
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
follow up um thank you and us follow-up
 
04:46:26.208 --> 04:46:26.218 align:start position:0%
would that be for to determine what what
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
qualifies as a major decision versus one
 
04:46:29.930 --> 04:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
that's minor that's something where I'd
 
04:46:32.270 --> 04:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
like to get an idea of what level of um
 
04:46:34.128 --> 04:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
what level of detail you're interested
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
in and that might just be a follow-up
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
issue to get back with the committee but
 
04:46:39.650 --> 04:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
I think that would be helpful to know
 
04:46:41.330 --> 04:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
and we can I mean the quality Council
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
meets on Tuesday so we can definitely
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
talk about that as a council so that we
 
04:46:47.150 --> 04:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
can give you a position in more details
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
on that but I can tell you that the
 
04:46:50.510 --> 04:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
intent was not that we would be involved
 
04:46:52.730 --> 04:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
if someone's moving offices or they need
 
04:46:54.890 --> 04:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
a new copy machine or things like that
 
04:46:56.750 --> 04:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
it was the big decisions that are
 
04:46:58.128 --> 04:46:58.138 align:start position:0%
significantly impacting the
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
developmental Disability Services System
 
04:47:02.330 --> 04:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:05.930 --> 04:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
you want to see any other questions
 
04:47:11.690 --> 04:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you
 
04:47:11.700 --> 04:47:17.350 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you

hey all right
 
04:47:42.540 --> 04:47:43.670 align:start position:0%
hey all right

04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier I am also a
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
member of the DD quality Council I was
 
04:48:10.670 --> 04:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
its chair for the first seven or eight
 
04:48:10.680 --> 04:48:12.470 align:start position:0%
its chair for the first seven or eight
years

04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
um you've already heard about the
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
membership and why those members are so
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
crucial to be heard on quality issues
 
04:48:24.650 --> 04:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
this is a legislatively seated Council
 
04:48:26.930 --> 04:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
it has a very specific mandate to
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
monitor all accessory system in order to
 
04:48:32.570 --> 04:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
do that we need meaningful data on a
 
04:48:36.110 --> 04:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
regular basis as we request it
 
04:48:38.208 --> 04:48:38.218 align:start position:0%
department has a seat on the council as
 
04:48:42.368 --> 04:48:42.378 align:start position:0%
well and is an active participant
 
04:48:45.410 --> 04:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
sometimes our requests for data are
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
responded to promptly sometimes not
 
04:48:52.490 --> 04:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
um we've got some pieces of data we've
 
04:48:54.650 --> 04:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
requested over and over again in the
 
04:48:56.690 --> 04:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
context of a meeting it's meant to be
 
04:49:00.050 --> 04:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
collegial it's meant to be collaborative
 
04:49:01.970 --> 04:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
um but it's gotten to the point where
 
04:49:04.010 --> 04:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes it seems like for the council
 
04:49:05.930 --> 04:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
to get what it needs it needs to put its
 
04:49:07.250 --> 04:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
requests in writing so they're very
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
specific so there's no misunderstanding
 
04:49:12.288 --> 04:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
of what is being asked and then we
 
04:49:14.330 --> 04:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
usually ask for written responses and
 
04:49:14.340 --> 04:49:15.410 align:start position:0%
usually ask for written responses and
and

04:49:15.410 --> 04:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
it's just come to that and and to be
 
04:49:19.730 --> 04:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
fair you know over the years the
 
04:49:21.530 --> 04:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
bureau's been short staffed and you know
 
04:49:24.590 --> 04:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know amassing data is is a
 
04:49:26.208 --> 04:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
challenging thing so this isn't meant to
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
be punitive but it's meant to be clear
 
04:49:30.590 --> 04:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
when you sit in a room and you have a
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
conversation among a lot of people
 
04:49:36.770 --> 04:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
but you don't document it sometimes you
 
04:49:37.850 --> 04:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
leave that meeting if you don't meet
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
again for two months you forget what did
 
04:49:41.570 --> 04:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
I promise I was going to do I mean you
 
04:49:44.270 --> 04:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
know so having
 
04:49:46.368 --> 04:49:46.378 align:start position:0%
specifically data requests from the
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
Department be very clear and very
 
04:49:49.970 --> 04:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
specific in what is being asked and then
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
having the department come back and say
 
04:49:53.810 --> 04:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
we'll get you this by this date we can't
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
give you that because we don't collect
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
it or whatever
 
04:50:00.490 --> 04:50:00.500 align:start position:0%
um keeps continuity it keeps the Council
 
04:50:05.330 --> 04:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
on track and it's clear you know there's
 
04:50:06.830 --> 04:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
nothing better than a written contract
 
04:50:08.208 --> 04:50:08.218 align:start position:0%
even among the best of friends
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's roles are clearly defined
 
04:50:13.310 --> 04:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
and it is really difficult for the
 
04:50:16.310 --> 04:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
council to do the work it has to do
 
04:50:18.350 --> 04:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
further what we've learned from
 
04:50:20.690 --> 04:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
testimony on the last bill
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
had the department come to this Council
 
04:50:26.090 --> 04:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
before it hired a m
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
so this council could have made
 
04:50:29.448 --> 04:50:29.458 align:start position:0%
recommendations on what the system
 
04:50:31.610 --> 04:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
really needed to work on for the
 
04:50:33.470 --> 04:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
meaningful improvements that everybody
 
04:50:35.570 --> 04:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
wants it would have looked very
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
different very different
 
04:50:41.330 --> 04:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
instead the department embarked on this
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
exercise with an out-of-state consultant
 
04:50:45.410 --> 04:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
for an exorbitant amount of money
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
and it's gone in such a direction on
 
04:50:51.708 --> 04:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
many of the recommendations that are not
 
04:50:54.288 --> 04:50:54.298 align:start position:0%
what families have repeatedly said they
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
want and so this would avoid that
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
because had had the department come to
 
04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
the council and said what do you think
 
04:51:01.368 --> 04:51:01.378 align:start position:0%
of the idea of two-tiered waivers with
 
04:51:03.650 --> 04:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
caps we could have given them some very
 
04:51:07.010 --> 04:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
meaningful feedback on why perhaps
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
that's not the best idea and would be
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
documented and written and there would
 
04:51:13.368 --> 04:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
be robust back and forth not only among
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
the people who administer such things
 
04:51:17.150 --> 04:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
but the people for whom it will impact
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
most the people on the ground the
 
04:51:21.708 --> 04:51:21.718 align:start position:0%
families and the individuals served and
 
04:51:23.090 --> 04:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
maybe we could have avoided a whole
 
04:51:25.850 --> 04:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff and and there's been
 
04:51:27.530 --> 04:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
enough said on the remote access issue I
 
04:51:30.288 --> 04:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
think you get why that's important
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
um keeping also in mind that many
 
04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
families right now can't hire staff so
 
04:51:35.090 --> 04:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
they've had to leave their own jobs to
 
04:51:36.110 --> 04:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
be staff
 
04:51:37.970 --> 04:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
but you know they're members and they
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
have meaningful voices and we don't want
 
04:51:41.690 --> 04:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
them to be silenced
 
04:51:43.850 --> 04:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
um but you really
 
04:51:46.970 --> 04:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
um need to understand that
 
04:51:49.788 --> 04:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
not Consulting the final users of the
 
04:51:52.610 --> 04:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
system first
 
04:51:55.128 --> 04:51:55.138 align:start position:0%
can result in many unintended negative
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
consequences that now I think we're
 
04:51:58.730 --> 04:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
starting to try to see if we can put the
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
brakes on and dig out of and so this is
 
04:52:03.470 --> 04:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
being more proactive to avoid such
 
04:52:08.810 --> 04:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
perfect timing
 
04:52:14.330 --> 04:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
any questions get it down now
 
04:52:18.050 --> 04:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:25.010 --> 04:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Will Walker
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
hello thanks again for the opportunity
 
04:52:36.050 --> 04:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
to speak live in Hollis with my son
 
04:52:38.330 --> 04:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
who's 23 year olds with autism
 
04:52:41.208 --> 04:52:41.218 align:start position:0%
I'm requesting your support for HP 238
 
04:52:43.310 --> 04:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to repeat too much of
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
what's already been said uh in the
 
04:52:46.128 --> 04:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning and what's
 
04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
happened now but you know my wife and I
 
04:52:50.690 --> 04:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
are Advocates we Advocate strongly for
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
our son
 
04:52:55.490 --> 04:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
um we rely upon being involved we we we
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
rely upon the nothing about us without
 
04:53:00.770 --> 04:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
us portion right if you if you look at
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 171 it means that people uh and and
 
04:53:05.810 --> 04:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
families of people with disabilities
 
04:53:08.330 --> 04:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
need to be involved in changes affecting
 
04:53:08.340 --> 04:53:09.110 align:start position:0%
need to be involved in changes affecting
them

04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
okay so we cannot always be aware of
 
04:53:14.750 --> 04:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
everything we can rely upon the quality
 
04:53:17.448 --> 04:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
Council to be aware okay we want them to
 
04:53:18.890 --> 04:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
have the awareness we want them to have
 
04:53:20.930 --> 04:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
the information we want them to have to
 
04:53:23.208 --> 04:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
have the ability to have input they help
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
us right they help families provide
 
04:53:29.330 --> 04:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
input help families provide you know the
 
04:53:31.788 --> 04:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
influence over what policies are going
 
04:53:33.230 --> 04:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
to affect them so
 
04:53:34.850 --> 04:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
be very brief

of everything that we've been talking to
 
04:54:31.850 --> 04:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
talking about today uh I'm from Mount
 
04:54:34.368 --> 04:54:34.378 align:start position:0%
Vernon New Hampshire I am a parent of a
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
now adult daughter who experiences a
 
04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
significant developmental disability
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
um she still lives at home with my
 
04:54:43.570 --> 04:54:43.580 align:start position:0%
husband and I and her younger brother
 
04:54:45.770 --> 04:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to pass this around
 
04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
picture of Chloe here so you can see who
 
04:54:54.070 --> 04:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
my husband and I provide
 
04:54:58.730 --> 04:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
um just about all of the supports that
 
04:55:01.368 --> 04:55:01.378 align:start position:0%
she needs she needs support 24 7 to be
 
04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
safe and to live a meaningful life we've
 
04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
also helped to support her to open up
 
04:55:07.128 --> 04:55:07.138 align:start position:0%
her own small business she loves
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
shredding paper so she um has Chloe's
 
04:55:12.410 --> 04:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
Shred Shed in her own workspace and my
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
husband and I work full-time remotely
 
04:55:18.350 --> 04:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
and we while he's working I'm with Chloe
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
while I'm working he's with Chloe so
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
between our full-time jobs and caring
 
04:55:24.770 --> 04:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
for Chloe because she can never be left
 
04:55:24.780 --> 04:55:25.750 align:start position:0%
for Chloe because she can never be left
alone

04:55:25.750 --> 04:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
alone
 
04:55:28.610 --> 04:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
that's our life and we haven't been able
 
04:55:33.230 --> 04:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
to hire dsps to fully utilize her budget
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
and support her needs because of the
 
04:55:37.490 --> 04:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
workforce crisis
 
04:55:40.448 --> 04:55:40.458 align:start position:0%
getting to this bill right here today
 
04:55:44.570 --> 04:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
this bill HB 238 I urge you to support
 
04:55:46.490 --> 04:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
it because it's a reasonable and
 
04:55:48.650 --> 04:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate and it really seeks to make
 
04:55:50.810 --> 04:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
sure that the quality Council the
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
experts within the system the users of
 
04:55:56.208 --> 04:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
the system and the vendor agencies and
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
area agencies and other stakeholder and
 
04:55:59.280 --> 04:56:01.610 align:start position:0%
area agencies and other stakeholder and
groups

04:56:01.610 --> 04:56:01.620 align:start position:0%
groups
 
04:56:04.368 --> 04:56:04.378 align:start position:0%
that know where the barriers are where
 
04:56:06.288 --> 04:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
the challenges are you know they're at
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
that street level and they can provide
 
04:56:09.730 --> 04:56:09.740 align:start position:0%
the knowledge
 
04:56:14.330 --> 04:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
and wisdom to help make appropriate
 
04:56:14.340 --> 04:56:16.430 align:start position:0%
and wisdom to help make appropriate
changes

04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:56:18.288 --> 04:56:18.298 align:start position:0%
to either the waivers or the
 
04:56:19.970 --> 04:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
developmental service system so it can
 
04:56:21.550 --> 04:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
work more efficiently
 
04:56:21.560 --> 04:56:23.770 align:start position:0%
work more efficiently
unfortunately

04:56:23.770 --> 04:56:23.780 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
the council was sidestepped during this
 
04:56:28.850 --> 04:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
most recent process when the bureau went
 
04:56:31.730 --> 04:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the system and this bill
 
04:56:34.250 --> 04:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
will help to ensure that it brings it
 
04:56:35.570 --> 04:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
back I know that the department
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned a few things about you know
 
04:56:39.288 --> 04:56:39.298 align:start position:0%
was this going from advisory to
 
04:56:39.298 --> 04:56:40.850 align:start position:0%
was this going from advisory to
oversight

04:56:40.850 --> 04:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
04:56:40.860 --> 04:56:42.110 align:start position:0%
oversight
um

04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:44.330 --> 04:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
and they mentioned how robust their
 
04:56:46.310 --> 04:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input was I wanted to let
 
04:56:48.708 --> 04:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
you know while I I'm not on one of the
 
04:56:50.330 --> 04:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
work groups they were holding the
 
04:56:52.610 --> 04:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
department was holding these Zoom like
 
04:56:54.490 --> 04:56:54.500 align:start position:0%
webinar meetings
 
04:56:57.470 --> 04:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
not every month but several they've had
 
04:57:00.170 --> 04:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
them for you know multiple months and
 
04:57:03.170 --> 04:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
you can't see anybody who's on other
 
04:57:05.448 --> 04:57:05.458 align:start position:0%
than the bureau people and the a m
 
04:57:07.368 --> 04:57:07.378 align:start position:0%
people you can't see any of the families
 
04:57:09.708 --> 04:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
or individuals in order to ask a
 
04:57:11.930 --> 04:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
question you have to type it into the
 
04:57:14.868 --> 04:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
chat my daughter Chloe can't type it in
 
04:57:16.850 --> 04:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
so it was very hard for people with
 
04:57:20.208 --> 04:57:20.218 align:start position:0%
disabilities to even access that and to
 
04:57:23.330 --> 04:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
be perfectly honest based on the
 
04:57:25.970 --> 04:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
proposals that they've put forward that
 
04:57:29.330 --> 04:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
input isn't there and they're not
 
04:57:32.030 --> 04:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
listening some parents feel like they
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input themselves to death
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
because you keep putting in some input
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
but it's not really being hurt and this
 
04:57:43.850 --> 04:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
bill make makes sense because it will
 
04:57:45.590 --> 04:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
help to ensure that and I'm sure about
 
04:57:48.410 --> 04:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
the contract ma'am yes the Contracting
 
04:57:50.448 --> 04:57:50.458 align:start position:0%
confidentiality I'm sure there's a way
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
around that as well this bill will help
 
04:57:55.310 --> 04:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
put the spirit of the law that's already
 
04:57:58.970 --> 04:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
in place for this entity it'll help see
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
that through and ensure that they're
 
04:58:04.368 --> 04:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
making those functional contributions
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:11.090 --> 04:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
oh yes go ahead representative profile
 
04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
yes so you hit on a concern that I had
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
when I read the bill which is you can
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism for input the question
 
04:58:17.280 --> 04:58:18.050 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism for input the question
is

04:58:18.050 --> 04:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:58:20.570 --> 04:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
will that input be heard and responded
 
04:58:23.930 --> 04:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
to so the bill the bill does provide
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
that there should be a response you know
 
04:58:29.990 --> 04:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
if exactly both in an affirmative in a
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
um so if the if the department agrees
 
04:58:34.190 --> 04:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
with or doesn't agree with
 
04:58:34.200 --> 04:58:35.150 align:start position:0%
with or doesn't agree with
um

04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:38.150 --> 04:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that you can uh
 
04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
foresee that might help to ensure that
 
04:58:43.250 --> 04:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
that input is really
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
um clearly heard and acted upon when
 
04:58:47.208 --> 04:58:47.218 align:start position:0%
appropriate I guess right you know so so
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
that's my general concern about this is
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
we can create a commission we can create
 
04:58:52.430 --> 04:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
it we can create a mechanism for people
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
to provide input which is great
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
um how do we ensure that that input is
 
04:59:00.770 --> 04:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
is really taken to Heart well there's no
 
04:59:02.510 --> 04:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
guarantees in life but this really does
 
04:59:04.730 --> 04:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
help you know when the quality Council
 
04:59:07.250 --> 04:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for over for the
 
04:59:09.050 --> 04:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
oversight of quality within the system
 
04:59:10.970 --> 04:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
can't get the information they need to
 
04:59:13.610 --> 04:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
be able to evaluate things make
 
04:59:15.350 --> 04:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations I think it's really
 
04:59:16.910 --> 04:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
important this bill includes the fact
 
04:59:18.530 --> 04:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
that when they do make recommendations
 
04:59:20.690 --> 04:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
the quality Council that if the
 
04:59:22.610 --> 04:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
department chooses to forego those
 
04:59:24.230 --> 04:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations that they respond in
 
04:59:27.770 --> 04:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
writing they explain why that's the case
 
04:59:27.780 --> 04:59:28.430 align:start position:0%
writing they explain why that's the case
um

04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think prior to this bill
 
04:59:33.110 --> 04:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know it was more like checking the
 
04:59:34.730 --> 04:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
box right we say oh we have these
 
04:59:36.770 --> 04:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
advisory councils oh we checked that box
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
we scheduled those meetings but I'll
 
04:59:40.850 --> 04:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
tell you as a family member spending
 
04:59:43.490 --> 04:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
several hours month after month
 
04:59:46.128 --> 04:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
typing into the chat and there were some
 
04:59:48.050 --> 04:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
sessions where they're like oh we don't
 
04:59:49.730 --> 04:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
feel like you know we can't scroll all
 
04:59:51.830 --> 04:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
the way back down the chat to find your
 
04:59:54.410 --> 04:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
questions just retype them
 
04:59:57.410 --> 04:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
it was just very frustrating and you
 
04:59:59.570 --> 04:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
know I'm not the fastest typer having
 
05:00:02.208 --> 05:00:02.218 align:start position:0%
one ham and having a hand and having a
 
05:00:04.730 --> 05:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
limb difference I'm like this this is
 
05:00:06.410 --> 05:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
about the developmental service system
 
05:00:08.330 --> 05:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
why aren't we making this accessible and
 
05:00:09.708 --> 05:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
I realize there are challenges around
 
05:00:11.690 --> 05:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
covid and maybe people didn't want to
 
05:00:13.970 --> 05:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
congregate in person but there were
 
05:00:15.890 --> 05:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
better ways to do that this is a
 
05:00:19.730 --> 05:00:19.740 align:start position:0%
reasonable step to help ensure that our
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
our input is being more thoughtfully
 
05:00:22.980 --> 05:00:24.948 align:start position:0%
our input is being more thoughtfully
considered

05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
considered
 
05:00:27.650 --> 05:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
gives the council more teeth
 
05:00:30.890 --> 05:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:32.690 --> 05:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions
 
05:00:37.550 --> 05:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:39.410 --> 05:00:39.420 align:start position:0%

good afternoon everyone I'm it'sadora

Rodriguez Le chandray I serve as the
 
05:00:59.690 --> 05:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
executive director at the New Hampshire
 
05:01:02.050 --> 05:01:02.060 align:start position:0%
Council on developmental disabilities
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chair and members of
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
the committee for hearing my testimony I
 
05:01:09.830 --> 05:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
won't take up too much time because I
 
05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
simply want to reiterate the importance
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
of the quality Council we are an entity
 
05:01:20.990 --> 05:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
that seats no less than three members of
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
the quality Council
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
we see a person with a disability a
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
direct support professional and an
 
05:01:31.368 --> 05:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
enhanced home care provider these are
 
05:01:34.250 --> 05:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
seats that are integral to determining
 
05:01:37.250 --> 05:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
and evaluating the service system and
 
05:01:39.830 --> 05:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
providing meaningful feedback and
 
05:01:39.840 --> 05:01:41.410 align:start position:0%
providing meaningful feedback and
recommendations

05:01:41.410 --> 05:01:41.420 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
05:01:44.810 --> 05:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
on what the service system needs and
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
what may or may not be
 
05:01:49.610 --> 05:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of decisions
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
that are made and so in my testimony
 
05:01:56.770 --> 05:01:56.780 align:start position:0%
that I provided I also cited the RFA
 
05:01:59.990 --> 05:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
171a which talks about the quality
 
05:02:02.270 --> 05:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
council's role in providing meaningful
 
05:02:05.448 --> 05:02:05.458 align:start position:0%
feedback to the department on decisions
 
05:02:09.050 --> 05:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
regarding quality services and as other
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
people have said
 
05:02:13.128 --> 05:02:13.138 align:start position:0%
that cannot happen if we are not
 
05:02:16.128 --> 05:02:16.138 align:start position:0%
receiving timely information before
 
05:02:18.890 --> 05:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
changes and decisions are made by the
 
05:02:18.900 --> 05:02:20.090 align:start position:0%
changes and decisions are made by the
department

05:02:20.090 --> 05:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:02:25.850 --> 05:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:27.948 --> 05:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
any questions from anyone
 
05:02:29.690 --> 05:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none
 
05:02:35.810 --> 05:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:38.448 --> 05:02:38.458 align:start position:0%
I have no other no other no one else
 
05:02:42.170 --> 05:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify on HB 238 does

public hearing on HB 238 and open the
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HP 317 and recognize
 
05:02:56.570 --> 05:02:56.580 align:start position:0%

05:03:13.550 --> 05:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:16.730 --> 05:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and uh
 
05:03:19.610 --> 05:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
boy you got you're a hard-working group
 
05:03:22.730 --> 05:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
so we tried I'm I'm representative Jerry
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
Stringham from Lincoln Woodstock and I'm
 
05:03:30.350 --> 05:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
here to introduce HB 317 which is an act
 
05:03:33.410 --> 05:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to study
 
05:03:36.170 --> 05:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
transitioning to a two-tiered waiver
 
05:03:38.990 --> 05:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
system for individuals eligible for
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
disability services
 
05:03:45.708 --> 05:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
uh as is a very clear uh by now uh the
 
05:03:47.930 --> 05:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
individuals and area agencies and other
 
05:03:50.448 --> 05:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
individuals that serve disabled Granite
 
05:03:50.458 --> 05:03:51.410 align:start position:0%
individuals that serve disabled Granite
Staters

05:03:51.410 --> 05:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
05:03:55.128 --> 05:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
uh have concerns about the transition to
 
05:03:56.810 --> 05:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
the Alvarez and Marshall reports
 
05:03:58.448 --> 05:03:58.458 align:start position:0%
recommendation of a two-tiered
 
05:04:01.128 --> 05:04:01.138 align:start position:0%
disability system
 
05:04:03.350 --> 05:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
since you have heard a lot about it
 
05:04:05.810 --> 05:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
already I will just say that important
 
05:04:08.030 --> 05:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
state stakeholders feel strongly that
 
05:04:11.288 --> 05:04:11.298 align:start position:0%
they're input had not been heard yet and
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
I saw that they had severe concerns that
 
05:04:17.770 --> 05:04:17.780 align:start position:0%
the move to a tier two two-tiered system
 
05:04:21.610 --> 05:04:21.620 align:start position:0%
May create more problems that it solves
 
05:04:24.410 --> 05:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
my intent here was to assure thoughtful
 
05:04:28.010 --> 05:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
input before implementing to a change to
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
the two-tiered system with legislative
 
05:04:32.510 --> 05:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
input as well
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh HB 317's legislative solution is to
 
05:04:37.730 --> 05:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
create a commission to more thoroughly
 
05:04:40.448 --> 05:04:40.458 align:start position:0%
examine the two-tier program
 
05:04:44.750 --> 05:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
regarding HB 317 itself I have received
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
some feedback about the makeup of the
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh and that some that may want
 
05:04:52.750 --> 05:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
to provide input
 
05:04:55.628 --> 05:04:55.638 align:start position:0%
are not part of the membership
 
05:04:59.810 --> 05:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
OLS had restricted the committee size
 
05:05:04.670 --> 05:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
due to RSA 1449 but over the weekend I
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
got some also some additional
 
05:05:09.050 --> 05:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
information from the former chair that
 
05:05:10.610 --> 05:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
has some suggestions that would
 
05:05:12.910 --> 05:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
strengthen the committee
 
05:05:16.670 --> 05:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
and still still be within the context of
 
05:05:20.208 --> 05:05:20.218 align:start position:0%
1449 just mainly on naming those as
 
05:05:22.610 --> 05:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
non-voting members which in his
 
05:05:26.590 --> 05:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
experience is quite quite
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
effective so uh the other the other
 
05:05:32.448 --> 05:05:32.458 align:start position:0%
opportunity would be to as I've seen
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
other bills do say notwithstanding 1449
 
05:05:38.930 --> 05:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
and then having the broader committee is
 
05:05:41.890 --> 05:05:41.900 align:start position:0%
in the draft Amendment that
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
that I had worked on before ALS OLS had
 
05:05:50.570 --> 05:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
turned it down so basically this this
 
05:05:52.850 --> 05:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
bill was just a committee to to allow
 
05:05:56.448 --> 05:05:56.458 align:start position:0%
thoughtful progress on the structure of
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
the disability program particularly
 
05:06:01.250 --> 05:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
emphasizing the two-tier disability
 
05:06:03.530 --> 05:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
system and there's a lot of people here
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
with a lot more experience than me on
 
05:06:09.770 --> 05:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
this but uh I thank you for for uh
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
taking this up and looking out for these
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh important and valued citizens and of
 
05:06:16.970 --> 05:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
course I'm happy to answer any questions
 
05:06:19.310 --> 05:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
that you may have thank you question
 
05:06:24.730 --> 05:06:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:06:28.490 --> 05:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
taking the question I think I'm going to
 
05:06:30.590 --> 05:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
wait to ask for a definition of a
 
05:06:33.170 --> 05:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
two-tiered waiver system unless you want
 
05:06:35.570 --> 05:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
to answer that but the question I have
 
05:06:38.448 --> 05:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
for you is we just heard a bill about
 
05:06:38.458 --> 05:06:39.708 align:start position:0%
for you is we just heard a bill about
the

05:06:39.708 --> 05:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:42.170 --> 05:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities Council and
 
05:06:44.990 --> 05:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
the ways that that should be a more
 
05:06:45.000 --> 05:06:46.128 align:start position:0%
the ways that that should be a more
um

05:06:46.128 --> 05:06:46.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
that there should be more responsiveness
 
05:06:49.610 --> 05:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
between the department and the
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities Council
 
05:06:56.448 --> 05:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
why is this not duplicative
 
05:06:58.730 --> 05:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's possible there's some over
 
05:07:00.890 --> 05:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
overlap uh the disability the
 
05:07:02.830 --> 05:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
communications I had with the disability
 
05:07:06.530 --> 05:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh Community was specifically on the
 
05:07:09.650 --> 05:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
implementation of the two-tiered system
 
05:07:09.660 --> 05:07:11.208 align:start position:0%
implementation of the two-tiered system
where

05:07:11.208 --> 05:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:07:13.550 --> 05:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
um uh you know where the level of
 
05:07:16.610 --> 05:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
benefits would be different for uh one
 
05:07:18.410 --> 05:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
group of disabled
 
05:07:18.420 --> 05:07:19.070 align:start position:0%
group of disabled
um

05:07:19.070 --> 05:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:22.490 --> 05:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
citizens versus versus another changing
 
05:07:24.530 --> 05:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
basically the packages of services they
 
05:07:28.610 --> 05:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
would be eligible to receive so this
 
05:07:30.170 --> 05:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
committee which has a you know short
 
05:07:32.570 --> 05:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
comparatively short Horizon would really
 
05:07:36.410 --> 05:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
be addressing specifically that program
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh rather than perhaps a broader issue
 
05:07:41.868 --> 05:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
with the previous bill but I'm not an
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
expert on the earlier bill either thank
 
05:07:43.920 --> 05:07:44.990 align:start position:0%
expert on the earlier bill either thank
you

05:07:44.990 --> 05:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you had your hand
 
05:07:48.110 --> 05:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
up a moment ago
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
I think that my my piece of turf has
 
05:07:55.490 --> 05:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
been plowed already so thank you
 
05:07:57.530 --> 05:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Nagle
 
05:07:59.390 --> 05:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
05:08:02.030 --> 05:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
my question so we've heard three bills
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
today that there's a lot of overlap on
 
05:08:07.190 --> 05:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
and the first bill was 608
 
05:08:09.890 --> 05:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
um it would seem to me that if that Bill
 
05:08:12.170 --> 05:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
gets passed that this bill becomes
 
05:08:12.180 --> 05:08:13.850 align:start position:0%
gets passed that this bill becomes
Superfluous

05:08:13.850 --> 05:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
Superfluous
 
05:08:13.860 --> 05:08:15.288 align:start position:0%
Superfluous
um

05:08:15.288 --> 05:08:15.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
um do you have an opinion on 608 I'm
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
just curious well I I did speak with the
 
05:08:23.930 --> 05:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of 608 before uh you know
 
05:08:27.410 --> 05:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
during the bill submission process and
 
05:08:30.890 --> 05:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
um you know I thought that uh you know
 
05:08:32.930 --> 05:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
committee or commission might be a
 
05:08:34.250 --> 05:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
better way to get at the issue than
 
05:08:36.190 --> 05:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
actually trying to implement something
 
05:08:40.010 --> 05:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
and uh under under uh some kind of a
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
temporary program
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
um so I I just thought it was a better
 
05:08:46.910 --> 05:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
way to start so I ended up submitting
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
this bill rather than signing on to that
 
05:08:49.440 --> 05:08:50.708 align:start position:0%
this bill rather than signing on to that
one

05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:08:53.150 --> 05:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:09:00.350 --> 05:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
on page on line 11 and
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
again on 15
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
you use the word leader of the minority
 
05:09:06.000 --> 05:09:07.430 align:start position:0%
you use the word leader of the minority
party

05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
party
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
a party seems strange to be in that
 
05:09:14.288 --> 05:09:14.298 align:start position:0%
context that's a very political
 
05:09:17.050 --> 05:09:17.060 align:start position:0%
concept from my point of view
 
05:09:21.288 --> 05:09:21.298 align:start position:0%
and so I wonder if that's whether
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh whether you wanted this to be a
 
05:09:28.208 --> 05:09:28.218 align:start position:0%
political appointment by the sound of it
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh that's not really what I what I had
 
05:09:33.410 --> 05:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
in mind I just I just thought it's a
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue so so
 
05:09:37.320 --> 05:09:37.970 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue so so
um

05:09:37.970 --> 05:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
should probably be a bipartisan
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
commission so that was my thought at the
 
05:09:46.690 --> 05:09:46.700 align:start position:0%
time maybe you could just take out party
 
05:09:50.690 --> 05:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
or have a party or something
 
05:09:50.700 --> 05:09:52.430 align:start position:0%
or have a party or something
yeah

05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
I am seeing none
 
05:10:04.750 --> 05:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Melissa
 
05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
Nemeth from the Department of Health and
 
05:10:16.810 --> 05:10:16.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:19.128 --> 05:10:19.138 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again Mr chairman and
 
05:10:20.990 --> 05:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee again for the
 
05:10:23.330 --> 05:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
record my name is Melissa Nemeth and I
 
05:10:25.070 --> 05:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
am the legislative liaison for the
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental services and
 
05:10:28.850 --> 05:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
again we wanted to provide some
 
05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
information to the committee with
 
05:10:32.270 --> 05:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
respect to this bill
 
05:10:34.010 --> 05:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
um and in part to answer representative
 
05:10:37.128 --> 05:10:37.138 align:start position:0%
Shapiro's question that he posed to the
 
05:10:41.570 --> 05:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor the tiered waivers are the
 
05:10:43.690 --> 05:10:43.700 align:start position:0%
idea is that potentially there could be
 
05:10:46.368 --> 05:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
two different waivers for people with
 
05:10:48.288 --> 05:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and the
 
05:10:50.930 --> 05:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
services provided on those waivers would
 
05:10:52.368 --> 05:10:52.378 align:start position:0%
be a little different with one being
 
05:10:55.128 --> 05:10:55.138 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive than the other in the
 
05:10:57.890 --> 05:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
idea being that the end goal is to
 
05:11:00.650 --> 05:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
ensure that only those individuals with
 
05:11:03.050 --> 05:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
the highest level of need access to
 
05:11:06.050 --> 05:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
access access the services that are the
 
05:11:08.690 --> 05:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
most costly so really ensuring that
 
05:11:10.788 --> 05:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
people are getting the most appropriate
 
05:11:13.310 --> 05:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
services in in the most you know there's
 
05:11:15.650 --> 05:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness but it has to to
 
05:11:17.570 --> 05:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
match the needs of the individual so the
 
05:11:18.830 --> 05:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
idea is you you match that up
 
05:11:18.840 --> 05:11:20.590 align:start position:0%
idea is you you match that up
appropriately

05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
05:11:24.590 --> 05:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
and that was a recommendation from a m
 
05:11:27.110 --> 05:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
um we have already the department has
 
05:11:29.330 --> 05:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
been working on that there is um as as
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
part of the redesign work that you've
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
heard a great deal about today there are
 
05:11:35.330 --> 05:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
several committees that have been
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
established one is titled the waiver
 
05:11:41.868 --> 05:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
structure work group and it was decided
 
05:11:45.670 --> 05:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
and they've met excuse me for uh since
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
2021 and still ongoing today but as of
 
05:11:54.410 --> 05:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
the spring of 2022 because as you've
 
05:11:56.090 --> 05:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
heard there is a great deal of change
 
05:11:59.690 --> 05:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
happening the department decided that in
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
the context of all the other work going
 
05:12:03.708 --> 05:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
on perhaps it was time to slow down
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
where we could and so it was decided
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
that the tiered waiver discussions would
 
05:12:11.448 --> 05:12:11.458 align:start position:0%
be tabled for a time and those
 
05:12:13.128 --> 05:12:13.138 align:start position:0%
discussions are not expected to pick
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
back up until the fall or or winter of
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
this year the waiver structure work
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
group is still meeting and and they are
 
05:12:23.810 --> 05:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
discussing you know services and service
 
05:12:25.970 --> 05:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
definitions but the idea of a tiered
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
waiver has been put on hold by the
 
05:12:31.490 --> 05:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
department at this time and it's it
 
05:12:33.110 --> 05:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
almost feels like this commission could
 
05:12:35.390 --> 05:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
be a duplication of efforts with that
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
group that is going on
 
05:12:38.930 --> 05:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
um and I know that you know a lot of the
 
05:12:41.150 --> 05:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
concerns are making sure that this would
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
really change potentially services that
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
are are being provided in the structure
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the waiver so it's critically
 
05:12:49.128 --> 05:12:49.138 align:start position:0%
important to hear from all stakeholders
 
05:12:52.730 --> 05:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
most importantly those of the families
 
05:12:55.010 --> 05:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
so we have those ongoing groups where
 
05:12:56.448 --> 05:12:56.458 align:start position:0%
there are family members that are
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
present on those groups but if the
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
department if and when the department
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
proposes any changes to a waiver per the
 
05:13:05.390 --> 05:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines there is a lengthy
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
period of time with stakeholder
 
05:13:10.190 --> 05:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
engagement where to the extent that it's
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
that people feel their input has not
 
05:13:15.288 --> 05:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
been provided prior to even a draft of
 
05:13:17.208 --> 05:13:17.218 align:start position:0%
the waiver they would have an additional
 
05:13:19.250 --> 05:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
time to voice those concerns the
 
05:13:20.990 --> 05:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
department would be responsible for
 
05:13:23.288 --> 05:13:23.298 align:start position:0%
responding to those concerns
 
05:13:25.250 --> 05:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
additionally we would have to get
 
05:13:27.830 --> 05:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
approval from HHS oversight before
 
05:13:29.628 --> 05:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
implementing any waivers and we would
 
05:13:33.050 --> 05:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
also have to go bring that to the
 
05:13:35.270 --> 05:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
medical care advisory committee so there
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
are a lot of groups that would provide
 
05:13:39.170 --> 05:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
oversight and a lot of opportunities for
 
05:13:41.448 --> 05:13:41.458 align:start position:0%
feedback in that regard
 
05:13:44.690 --> 05:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber thank you and
 
05:13:49.368 --> 05:13:49.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question could
 
05:13:52.610 --> 05:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
you give us uh not necessarily now but
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps by email the exact composition
 
05:13:57.288 --> 05:13:57.298 align:start position:0%
of that working group I'd be happy to do
 
05:14:01.010 --> 05:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
that yes so we know who is there and and
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
to what extent the people covered by the
 
05:14:06.890 --> 05:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
various other bills are already involved
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
in that group I would be happy to I can
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
get to the um the clerk there is a
 
05:14:15.770 --> 05:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
website devoted to the stakeholder
 
05:14:17.628 --> 05:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
engagement through this redesign process
 
05:14:20.090 --> 05:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
that it will take you there's a lot of
 
05:14:21.410 --> 05:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
links and it can take you to a lot of
 
05:14:23.810 --> 05:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
places but it has the makeup of all of
 
05:14:25.550 --> 05:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
these different groups that has the
 
05:14:26.770 --> 05:14:26.780 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes
 
05:14:28.970 --> 05:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
for most of the meetings I don't know if
 
05:14:30.530 --> 05:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
all the meeting minutes are posted but
 
05:14:31.970 --> 05:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
there is a great deal of information
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
that I think could be helpful for all
 
05:14:34.850 --> 05:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
these bills and I'd be happy to provide
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you thank you all the
 
05:14:37.200 --> 05:14:39.970 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you thank you all the
questions

05:14:39.970 --> 05:14:39.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:42.170 --> 05:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
05:14:44.448 --> 05:14:44.458 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much this
 
05:14:46.490 --> 05:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
seems like one of the opportunities for
 
05:14:49.070 --> 05:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
the council to work with that work group
 
05:14:51.170 --> 05:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if there's a way for
 
05:14:52.970 --> 05:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
that to happen with input so that
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
instead of having this this um
 
05:14:58.670 --> 05:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
commission there's more dialogue between
 
05:15:00.890 --> 05:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
the existing Council and that work group
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that those voices can happen
 
05:15:02.400 --> 05:15:04.430 align:start position:0%
so that those voices can happen
organically

05:15:04.430 --> 05:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
organically
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't have a great answer
 
05:15:07.610 --> 05:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
for that because I'm not sure I have the
 
05:15:09.288 --> 05:15:09.298 align:start position:0%
list but I know that's the the work
 
05:15:10.970 --> 05:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
group itself I think a lot of those
 
05:15:12.890 --> 05:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
meetings are public so I'm not sure I
 
05:15:15.110 --> 05:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
can certainly get back to you once I get
 
05:15:16.910 --> 05:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
more information from the program about
 
05:15:18.650 --> 05:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
what those opportunities are it's likely
 
05:15:20.208 --> 05:15:20.218 align:start position:0%
they exist but I'd be happy to provide
 
05:15:21.890 --> 05:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:28.430 --> 05:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
are you seeing no other questions
 
05:15:33.050 --> 05:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Alex katrubis
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:45.530 --> 05:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
05:15:47.750 --> 05:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Alice katrubis
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here to support this legislation on
 
05:15:52.490 --> 05:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
behalf of the 10 area agencies that
 
05:15:54.288 --> 05:15:54.298 align:start position:0%
provide services and coordinate services
 
05:15:55.610 --> 05:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
to people with developmental
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities and acquired brain
 
05:15:59.170 --> 05:15:59.180 align:start position:0%
disorders the 10 area agencies
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
unanimously voted to endorse the concept
 
05:16:04.970 --> 05:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
of further study of the a m recommend
 
05:16:07.368 --> 05:16:07.378 align:start position:0%
recommended changes to our long-standing
 
05:16:09.288 --> 05:16:09.298 align:start position:0%
Medicaid waiver and we thank
 
05:16:11.628 --> 05:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham who brought
 
05:16:13.730 --> 05:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
this issue forward on behalf of his
 
05:16:16.730 --> 05:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
constituents to allow them this forum to
 
05:16:17.868 --> 05:16:17.878 align:start position:0%
speak with you their elected
 
05:16:17.878 --> 05:16:18.948 align:start position:0%
speak with you their elected
representatives

05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
05:16:20.930 --> 05:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
as you heard from the legislation this
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
morning uh I think from our perspective
 
05:16:26.208 --> 05:16:26.218 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate decision to bring the a
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
m recommendations forward during the
 
05:16:31.010 --> 05:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
pandemic during the healthcare Workforce
 
05:16:33.410 --> 05:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
crisis and most importantly before we
 
05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
got into compliance with the CMS
 
05:16:38.150 --> 05:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan has caused a lot
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
of concern and confusion for not only
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
the area agencies but the families and
 
05:16:43.970 --> 05:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
the individuals who rely on the
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
developmental Services System
 
05:16:47.810 --> 05:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
just to give you a little background on
 
05:16:49.970 --> 05:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
the waiver it was created in the early
 
05:16:52.970 --> 05:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
1980s and it really has been a life
 
05:16:55.250 --> 05:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
support for thousands of lives over the
 
05:16:57.890 --> 05:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
decades the waiver has allowed us to not
 
05:17:00.530 --> 05:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
only access funding but to create the
 
05:17:02.270 --> 05:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
blueprint that we have
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
the array of the services and supports
 
05:17:06.770 --> 05:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
that families rely on so in a nutshell
 
05:17:08.690 --> 05:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
the waiver permits New Hampshire to
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
offer home and community-based care that
 
05:17:13.070 --> 05:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
assists people on Medicaid to live in
 
05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
their in their community
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
and the a m recommendations to make
 
05:17:18.770 --> 05:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
changes they may be a good thing they
 
05:17:21.288 --> 05:17:21.298 align:start position:0%
may not be a good thing uh
 
05:17:22.730 --> 05:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go into the definition
 
05:17:25.490 --> 05:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
of a waiver I'm happy to or the supports
 
05:17:27.170 --> 05:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
waiver and the two tiers because you've
 
05:17:28.490 --> 05:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
already heard that from the Department I
 
05:17:30.890 --> 05:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
know we've been here a long time but the
 
05:17:33.770 --> 05:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
reason that this bill is here is I mean
 
05:17:35.930 --> 05:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
the well was really poisoned from the
 
05:17:39.050 --> 05:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
from the gate from The Starting Gate the
 
05:17:41.330 --> 05:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
department hired a consultant a national
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
consultant to make recommended changes
 
05:17:46.910 --> 05:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
to the DD system the report came out and
 
05:17:48.708 --> 05:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
during that process they didn't consult
 
05:17:50.570 --> 05:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
with anyone who was a receiver of the
 
05:17:51.530 --> 05:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
service and they didn't consult with
 
05:17:53.208 --> 05:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
anyone who provided services to the
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
system so I think you could understand
 
05:17:57.050 --> 05:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
why there's a skepticism here of what
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
what went down so that's in the past I
 
05:18:01.368 --> 05:18:01.378 align:start position:0%
think we've had some good discussions
 
05:18:03.050 --> 05:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
today about how to move forward I think
 
05:18:04.730 --> 05:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
the department there's some new
 
05:18:06.350 --> 05:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
leadership who are working on these
 
05:18:08.510 --> 05:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
issues now and I I have a lot more
 
05:18:10.850 --> 05:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
confidence in them I think they they
 
05:18:13.730 --> 05:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
understand that it was a misstep how
 
05:18:16.730 --> 05:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
this all rolled out but there's concerns
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
and I think Kathy spinney said
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
it correctly uh we may want to go down
 
05:18:23.868 --> 05:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
this road with the two-tier waiver but
 
05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
we need to ask the families first we
 
05:18:27.230 --> 05:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
need to at least ask them first and the
 
05:18:28.910 --> 05:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
problem is yes there's all this robust
 
05:18:31.250 --> 05:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input I don't dispute that
 
05:18:33.050 --> 05:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
if some someone from the Department said
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
it was the most robust stakeholder input
 
05:18:36.650 --> 05:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
in the history of the department I don't
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily dispute that but the problem
 
05:18:40.368 --> 05:18:40.378 align:start position:0%
is is that the recommendation was
 
05:18:42.830 --> 05:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
already made so they said we're going to
 
05:18:44.930 --> 05:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
change the waiver now you tell us how
 
05:18:46.430 --> 05:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to implement it and that's
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
not how it should have happened we
 
05:18:49.128 --> 05:18:49.138 align:start position:0%
should have went to the families first
 
05:18:50.810 --> 05:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
and said do you think this is a good
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
idea then maybe we could go down that
 
05:18:55.490 --> 05:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
road so that this is clearly a reaction
 
05:18:57.170 --> 05:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
to that I understand that we have to
 
05:18:59.448 --> 05:18:59.458 align:start position:0%
move forward this bill was really I
 
05:19:01.250 --> 05:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
think an opportunity for people to have
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
their voices heard we want to try to be
 
05:19:05.448 --> 05:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
as collaborative as we can with the
 
05:19:07.310 --> 05:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
Department we understand the system
 
05:19:08.810 --> 05:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
needs to change but you know from the
 
05:19:10.970 --> 05:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
air agency perspective you know we
 
05:19:12.650 --> 05:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
really feel I don't know that starting
 
05:19:14.448 --> 05:19:14.458 align:start position:0%
this up in the fall makes sense you you
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
just heard this morning that we have to
 
05:19:18.830 --> 05:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
do direct Bill and conflict free July
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
1st we really want to start talking
 
05:19:23.090 --> 05:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
three months later to change the waiver
 
05:19:26.330 --> 05:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
I mean I let's get into CMS compliance
 
05:19:29.090 --> 05:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
let's let's that be the focus for 2023
 
05:19:31.850 --> 05:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
then maybe in 2024 we can look at
 
05:19:33.708 --> 05:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
changes to the DD waiver that's been in
 
05:19:36.890 --> 05:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
place for 40 years so I know it's been a
 
05:19:38.690 --> 05:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
long day Mr chairman so I appreciate it
 
05:19:40.610 --> 05:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to give a copy of my full
 
05:19:42.770 --> 05:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
remarks to the uh to the clerk for the
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
record so thank you very much thank you
 
05:19:48.350 --> 05:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:51.050 --> 05:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no questions okay thank you
 
05:19:57.830 --> 05:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.410 --> 05:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:20:08.810 --> 05:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:13.788 --> 05:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Will Walker
 
05:20:22.128 --> 05:20:22.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
I thank you again uh when I look at this
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
bill which I do support uh please please
 
05:20:29.868 --> 05:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
support it uh there was a question from
 
05:20:32.810 --> 05:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro okay about you
 
05:20:34.970 --> 05:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
know overlap with this morning and when
 
05:20:37.610 --> 05:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
I look at it this morning was if I look
 
05:20:40.490 --> 05:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
at just the requirements for July 1st
 
05:20:42.650 --> 05:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
the decisions been made and we want to
 
05:20:44.090 --> 05:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
do a pilot program to make sure that
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
thing's okay
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
this other stuff is not mandatory and is
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
optional and what I see this bill being
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
is something to evaluate is it the right
 
05:20:55.190 --> 05:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
thing to do okay so it's not to do a
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
pilot program on the execution of it but
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
first of all what is it and is it the
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
right thing to do so that's how I see
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
the difference between the bill we
 
05:21:03.890 --> 05:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
talked about this morning and this bill
 
05:21:03.900 --> 05:21:05.448 align:start position:0%
talked about this morning and this bill
today

05:21:05.448 --> 05:21:05.458 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:21:07.610 --> 05:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
um and you know I've read the Alvarez
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
and Marcel report over and over and over
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
again okay and you come across this this
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
re this multi-tier waiver structure it's
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
only a couple pages in there it's just
 
05:21:19.550 --> 05:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
they were just spitballing right here's
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
here's an idea that we might throw out
 
05:21:24.050 --> 05:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
there and in their own words it was to
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
incentive incentivize access to lower to
 
05:21:29.330 --> 05:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
your waivers and my understanding is
 
05:21:32.510 --> 05:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
when I look at this the the uh impetus
 
05:21:33.890 --> 05:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
for that came from other states where
 
05:21:35.448 --> 05:21:35.458 align:start position:0%
they had a wait list that was
 
05:21:37.490 --> 05:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
unmanageable and they were trying to
 
05:21:39.230 --> 05:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
manage their wait list okay so by
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
introducing multiple tiers to the
 
05:21:42.590 --> 05:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
structure they were able to pull some
 
05:21:44.448 --> 05:21:44.458 align:start position:0%
people off the wait list and so it was
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
an expedience measure and we don't have
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
that context here we don't have that
 
05:21:50.448 --> 05:21:50.458 align:start position:0%
problem it's a completely different
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
context okay so that just wanted to say
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know the multi tier waiver was an
 
05:21:58.368 --> 05:21:58.378 align:start position:0%
idea it's not well thought out Alvarez
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
Marcel even says in the report don't
 
05:22:01.490 --> 05:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
take it lightly figure out the right
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
thing to do here
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
and then you know what does that mean
 
05:22:07.368 --> 05:22:07.378 align:start position:0%
when you look at doing a multi-tier
 
05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
waiver it is huge it causes you to now
 
05:22:13.550 --> 05:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate how people are evaluated in
 
05:22:17.390 --> 05:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
the system what bucket do you fit in and
 
05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
to come back to software as soon as you
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
define a bucket Define multiple buckets
 
05:22:26.448 --> 05:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
you soon realize you've defined the
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
wrong buckets you don't have it done
 
05:22:30.050 --> 05:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
well all right so you're going to put
 
05:22:32.510 --> 05:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
somebody in the wrong bucket and when I
 
05:22:34.610 --> 05:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
look at this the way things are being
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
defined it comes it comes down to the
 
05:22:39.288 --> 05:22:39.298 align:start position:0%
service plan for the individual it
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't come come down to what bucket
 
05:22:43.310 --> 05:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
they fit in it comes down to what they
 
05:22:46.010 --> 05:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
require what needs do they have buckets
 
05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
won't Define that the service plan will
 
05:22:50.390 --> 05:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
Define that okay so I don't see it me
 
05:22:51.708 --> 05:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
personally I don't see a need for a
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
two-tier waiver system but let's have
 
05:22:57.890 --> 05:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
this let's have this uh go to a
 
05:23:00.050 --> 05:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
commission let's have the commission be
 
05:23:02.270 --> 05:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
involved or involve people with families
 
05:23:04.550 --> 05:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
you people with disabilities people with
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
disabilities themselves and decide what
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do here is okay so I
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
05:23:18.410 --> 05:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:23:20.570 --> 05:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious on this two-tiered
 
05:23:23.390 --> 05:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
system how close assuming we do nothing
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
here today are we to implementation of
 
05:23:27.110 --> 05:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
this two-tiered system
 
05:23:28.430 --> 05:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
think it's a good question it's
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
currently tabled tabled and then yeah I
 
05:23:34.190 --> 05:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
have a second follow-up question
 
05:23:34.200 --> 05:23:35.570 align:start position:0%
have a second follow-up question
um

05:23:35.570 --> 05:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:35.580 --> 05:23:37.250 align:start position:0%
um
um

05:23:37.250 --> 05:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:39.830 --> 05:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
would that system grandfather people
 
05:23:41.208 --> 05:23:41.218 align:start position:0%
that are already in the current system
 
05:23:42.890 --> 05:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
or does the entire everybody on the
 
05:23:44.448 --> 05:23:44.458 align:start position:0%
disability Spectrum have to be
 
05:23:47.150 --> 05:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
reevaluated my understanding is it's a
 
05:23:48.650 --> 05:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
complete reveal and you figure out what
 
05:23:50.810 --> 05:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
bucket to put people in so that could
 
05:23:53.208 --> 05:23:53.218 align:start position:0%
result in significant change in services
 
05:23:56.270 --> 05:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
significant change thank you other
 
05:23:56.280 --> 05:23:58.910 align:start position:0%
significant change thank you other
questions

05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:24:10.010 --> 05:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:11.690 --> 05:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
here it comes
 
05:24:11.700 --> 05:24:18.850 align:start position:0%
here it comes
foreign

05:24:18.850 --> 05:24:18.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:21.530 --> 05:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Jennifer
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:30.410 --> 05:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
hello again Jennifer Bertrand from Mount
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
Vernon a parent of Chloe Bertrand who is
 
05:24:36.410 --> 05:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
23 year old adults young woman who has a
 
05:24:37.850 --> 05:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
significant developmental intellectual
 
05:24:40.368 --> 05:24:40.378 align:start position:0%
disability she's living at home we help
 
05:24:42.830 --> 05:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
her run her business
 
05:24:44.330 --> 05:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
um you know she has a good life a
 
05:24:46.490 --> 05:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
meaningful life and she has a purpose in
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
the community by performing a service
 
05:24:51.410 --> 05:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
and enjoying recreational activities I
 
05:24:56.270 --> 05:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
support HB 317 like will just mentioned
 
05:24:58.430 --> 05:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
um the bill this morning is different
 
05:25:00.288 --> 05:25:00.298 align:start position:0%
from this bill because this bill is
 
05:25:02.810 --> 05:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
really the opportunity to think about
 
05:25:04.730 --> 05:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
should we even move in this direction
 
05:25:07.910 --> 05:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
break the DD waiver apart into two tiers
 
05:25:10.128 --> 05:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
and create these different buckets I
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
have some personal concerns as did Kathy
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
spinney who was here earlier
 
05:25:17.810 --> 05:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
as you might remember she also has an
 
05:25:20.690 --> 05:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
adult daughter who requires significant
 
05:25:20.700 --> 05:25:21.890 align:start position:0%
adult daughter who requires significant
supports

05:25:21.890 --> 05:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
supports
 
05:25:24.590 --> 05:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
just like my daughter Chloe Chloe would
 
05:25:28.670 --> 05:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
by would definitely qualify for a the
 
05:25:28.680 --> 05:25:29.990 align:start position:0%
by would definitely qualify for a the
more

05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:25:30.000 --> 05:25:30.708 align:start position:0%
more
um

05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:33.708 --> 05:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
not the Family Support waiver but the
 
05:25:36.170 --> 05:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
um waiver that would provide more robust
 
05:25:39.170 --> 05:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
services to individuals however
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
upon reviewing the most recent service
 
05:25:45.590 --> 05:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
definitions that the department had put
 
05:25:45.600 --> 05:25:46.670 align:start position:0%
definitions that the department had put
out

05:25:46.670 --> 05:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include that Chloe could live
 
05:25:51.530 --> 05:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
at home and that her family members and
 
05:25:54.050 --> 05:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
or dsps in the community could provide
 
05:25:55.970 --> 05:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
her with that support it would require
 
05:25:58.850 --> 05:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
us to pick out a place like I don't know
 
05:26:02.448 --> 05:26:02.458 align:start position:0%
a medical home or a mini Institution
 
05:26:04.670 --> 05:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
and put her in there instead of living
 
05:26:06.890 --> 05:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
her life in the community running her
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
business riding her bike in Amherst
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
Center and doing all the things that she
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
loves like kayaking and boating and you
 
05:26:17.208 --> 05:26:17.218 align:start position:0%
know enjoying Civic engagement like any
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
of us so that's my real concern and why
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
I support this bill because we really
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
need to think about is that splitting
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
the DD waiver into two separate waivers
 
05:26:28.368 --> 05:26:28.378 align:start position:0%
capping that lower waiver
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
would it mean that like all right we
 
05:26:33.650 --> 05:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
cannot do that to our daughter I can't
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
pick out a place for her and say yeah
 
05:26:37.368 --> 05:26:37.378 align:start position:0%
we're just gonna drop you off and leave
 
05:26:40.850 --> 05:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:42.890 --> 05:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
and no parent should have to have to
 
05:26:45.530 --> 05:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
make that choice by the way or maybe
 
05:26:47.030 --> 05:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
we'll just accept whatever that lower
 
05:26:49.310 --> 05:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
capped waiver amount even it if it means
 
05:26:51.890 --> 05:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
that she doesn't have the support that
 
05:26:53.390 --> 05:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
she needs maybe would mean that I quit
 
05:26:56.270 --> 05:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
my job and we just figure out a way to
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
live on my husband's salary while
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
helping our other children you know go
 
05:27:04.430 --> 05:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
to college or move on with their lives
 
05:27:04.440 --> 05:27:05.510 align:start position:0%
to college or move on with their lives
um

05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:07.490 --> 05:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
that many families won't have that
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
choice and then you might be looking at
 
05:27:10.970 --> 05:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
families that might need more govern
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
government assistance because they just
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
can't bear to place their daughter or
 
05:27:17.330 --> 05:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
their son in a placement
 
05:27:19.250 --> 05:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
people people don't want to live in
 
05:27:21.110 --> 05:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
placements necessarily we even heard
 
05:27:23.810 --> 05:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
testimony from Michelle earlier and we
 
05:27:25.070 --> 05:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
talked out in the hall we used to serve
 
05:27:26.330 --> 05:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
on the council on developmental
 
05:27:28.550 --> 05:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities and the reason why she's
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
moving into that that medical home is
 
05:27:32.090 --> 05:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
because she couldn't find the support
 
05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
that she needed because of the workforce
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
crisis having a waiver two-tiered waiver
 
05:27:40.190 --> 05:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
like this I see creating more challenges
 
05:27:44.570 --> 05:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
than you know it solving problems
 
05:27:44.580 --> 05:27:46.190 align:start position:0%
than you know it solving problems
okay

05:27:46.190 --> 05:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:27:51.288 --> 05:27:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.390 --> 05:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:27:55.490 --> 05:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
05:27:57.230 --> 05:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
um this should not
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
um be taken as any kind of comment on
 
05:28:01.850 --> 05:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
the two-tier waiver system versus what
 
05:28:03.410 --> 05:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
we have now I I don't really know
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
anything about it and I understand
 
05:28:10.010 --> 05:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
people being very concerned who's um
 
05:28:13.010 --> 05:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
who are in the system or whose family
 
05:28:15.770 --> 05:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
members are in the system but I'm kind
 
05:28:18.830 --> 05:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
of hung up on why and and so it's very
 
05:28:21.770 --> 05:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
important that there be a very
 
05:28:25.010 --> 05:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
um vibrant dialogue about this issue
 
05:28:28.730 --> 05:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
before it comes to fruition but I'm
 
05:28:31.730 --> 05:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why that can't happen in
 
05:28:34.910 --> 05:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
the context of the council
 
05:28:37.430 --> 05:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
which already meets which also already
 
05:28:39.288 --> 05:28:39.298 align:start position:0%
has a structure which wouldn't have to
 
05:28:41.628 --> 05:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
recruit new people or duplicate people
 
05:28:45.948 --> 05:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
in another group why is that the council
 
05:28:48.288 --> 05:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
not an Avenue to do the same thing
 
05:28:50.448 --> 05:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
you're describing that is so important
 
05:28:51.708 --> 05:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:28:53.990 --> 05:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know makes me think back to when we
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire made the decision to
 
05:28:57.708 --> 05:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change the Medicaid system
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
we went from our fee for service to you
 
05:29:03.470 --> 05:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
know managed care approach if you might
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
you might remember that we created a
 
05:29:09.350 --> 05:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
commission to study that transition and
 
05:29:13.190 --> 05:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
I think the reason to study this is in
 
05:29:15.650 --> 05:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
many ways the same as why we made the
 
05:29:19.030 --> 05:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
decision to study that trans transition
 
05:29:22.128 --> 05:29:22.138 align:start position:0%
I think this would provide more public
 
05:29:22.138 --> 05:29:24.650 align:start position:0%
I think this would provide more public
more

05:29:24.650 --> 05:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:29:24.660 --> 05:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
more
um

05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:25.440 --> 05:29:28.550 align:start position:0%
um
structured

05:29:28.550 --> 05:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:31.030 --> 05:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
thoughtful process
 
05:29:34.430 --> 05:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
which would be needed because
 
05:29:37.070 --> 05:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
if it were to move forward like it
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed now
 
05:29:40.610 --> 05:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
I mean imagine what that would mean to
 
05:29:44.270 --> 05:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
to Chloe and her life or Kelly who lives
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up once again I'm not
 
05:29:52.850 --> 05:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
commenting at all about whether it's a
 
05:29:55.490 --> 05:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
good idea or not just kind of where that
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
dialogue should take place and
 
05:29:58.200 --> 05:29:59.510 align:start position:0%
dialogue should take place and
um

05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:01.850 --> 05:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
and there is an issue that comes before
 
05:30:05.330 --> 05:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
us all the time about the abundance of
 
05:30:07.010 --> 05:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
commissions and the difficulty getting
 
05:30:09.830 --> 05:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
people to serve on them and that some
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
languish without really
 
05:30:14.510 --> 05:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum or not so
 
05:30:16.970 --> 05:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
my question is only really and and I
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
think you've answered it um
 
05:30:21.230 --> 05:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
only about whether we already have a
 
05:30:23.868 --> 05:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
vehicle for this dialogue
 
05:30:23.878 --> 05:30:24.770 align:start position:0%
vehicle for this dialogue
um

05:30:24.770 --> 05:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
or not yeah certainly the quality
 
05:30:30.170 --> 05:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
Council has its responsibilities and the
 
05:30:32.150 --> 05:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
things that it's supposed to do but I
 
05:30:33.890 --> 05:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
think this is even bigger than that like
 
05:30:36.530 --> 05:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
it deserves this much attention and this
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
kind of structure to more thoughtfully
 
05:30:40.910 --> 05:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
consider it and be a little bit more
 
05:30:42.410 --> 05:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
public and
 
05:30:42.420 --> 05:30:43.368 align:start position:0%
public and
um

05:30:43.368 --> 05:30:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:46.010 --> 05:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
and thoughtful about rolling something
 
05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
like that out
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong there might be other
 
05:30:51.410 --> 05:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
people with other points of view thank
 
05:30:54.050 --> 05:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber
 
05:30:56.270 --> 05:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and I was just perking back to
 
05:30:58.430 --> 05:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
the old the other um
 
05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
hearing when you passed a picture of
 
05:31:03.470 --> 05:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
Chloe around and it hasn't passed me so
 
05:31:05.448 --> 05:31:05.458 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it stopped anywhere or
 
05:31:08.030 --> 05:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
whether you have got it back yeah I do
 
05:31:11.750 --> 05:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions yes
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:31:17.760 --> 05:31:19.490 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
I'm

05:31:19.490 --> 05:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:31:22.070 --> 05:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
really struck with this tiered thing and
 
05:31:24.170 --> 05:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
I really want to understand it better so
 
05:31:25.610 --> 05:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
I work with people with chronic
 
05:31:27.948 --> 05:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
disabilities I see people on a quote
 
05:31:30.530 --> 05:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
patient-centered individual basis I see
 
05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
them and I make a decision
 
05:31:34.010 --> 05:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
what service that they get I don't have
 
05:31:35.690 --> 05:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
a limit
 
05:31:37.730 --> 05:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to understand is that how
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
if we go from a one-tier system do we go
 
05:31:43.430 --> 05:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
from that from a patient-centered thing
 
05:31:45.770 --> 05:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
to something that you can only be here
 
05:31:48.110 --> 05:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
or here and there's no overlap is that
 
05:31:51.410 --> 05:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
your understanding so you know I the the
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
department hasn't released everything
 
05:31:56.208 --> 05:31:56.218 align:start position:0%
and they've they've tabled it but be
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
sure it is not off the table and like
 
05:32:02.110 --> 05:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
will had said I think we given the other
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
requirements were and we're expected to
 
05:32:08.570 --> 05:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
meet through CMS it would be too too
 
05:32:15.650 --> 05:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:18.350 --> 05:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
I just I lost your question just could
 
05:32:20.330 --> 05:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
you repeat it yeah I'm trying to
 
05:32:20.340 --> 05:32:21.190 align:start position:0%
you repeat it yeah I'm trying to
understand

05:32:21.190 --> 05:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:32:26.150 --> 05:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
oh what what what it is now in a
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
one-tiered system versus what a two-tier
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
system so right now you know we sit down
 
05:32:34.010 --> 05:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh with our local area agency Chloe
 
05:32:36.110 --> 05:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
served through gateways
 
05:32:38.750 --> 05:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
and we put together a service budget you
 
05:32:39.708 --> 05:32:39.718 align:start position:0%
know we look at all the different
 
05:32:41.868 --> 05:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
aspects of her life like you know she
 
05:32:44.448 --> 05:32:44.458 align:start position:0%
has these employment support needs and
 
05:32:46.128 --> 05:32:46.138 align:start position:0%
she needs assistance with all of her
 
05:32:48.170 --> 05:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
activities of daily living Chloe also
 
05:32:51.590 --> 05:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
experiences uh a serious seizure
 
05:32:54.650 --> 05:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
disorder so you know the workers that
 
05:32:56.050 --> 05:32:56.060 align:start position:0%
support her they need to be
 
05:32:58.190 --> 05:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about how to keep her safe
 
05:33:01.070 --> 05:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
when she has a full-blown tonic clonic
 
05:33:03.288 --> 05:33:03.298 align:start position:0%
seizure she also is non-verbal and uses
 
05:33:06.410 --> 05:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
a variety of communication strategies so
 
05:33:07.850 --> 05:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
we sit down and we look at like all the
 
05:33:09.410 --> 05:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
different aspects of her life what is it
 
05:33:11.090 --> 05:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
what does a good life mean to Chloe she
 
05:33:13.490 --> 05:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
loves to go bike riding and you know she
 
05:33:15.890 --> 05:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
does some adaptive skiing and she loves
 
05:33:17.570 --> 05:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
the Black Diamond Trails because she's
 
05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
like her mom she like gets that Thrill
 
05:33:20.990 --> 05:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the rush you know
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so we sit down we put together
 
05:33:26.390 --> 05:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
um uh her service plan and when she was
 
05:33:28.970 --> 05:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
transitioning from you know into
 
05:33:32.930 --> 05:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
adulthood uh we built a budget based on
 
05:33:34.670 --> 05:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
Chloe as an individual and what it means
 
05:33:36.890 --> 05:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
to her to have a good life
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
the bureau's also been working on
 
05:33:42.770 --> 05:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
rate revisions and some of the
 
05:33:45.288 --> 05:33:45.298 align:start position:0%
conversations are using this thing
 
05:33:48.110 --> 05:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
called the supports intensity scale and
 
05:33:50.448 --> 05:33:50.458 align:start position:0%
tying like the the number that someone
 
05:33:52.550 --> 05:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
receives for their support's intensity
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
scale to like a budget amount and maybe
 
05:33:57.650 --> 05:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
that would be correlated when they do do
 
05:33:59.930 --> 05:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
a two-tiered waiver you know which
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
waiver the individual would receive
 
05:34:04.070 --> 05:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
right now it's just the DD waiver it's
 
05:34:06.110 --> 05:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
based on who is this individual what
 
05:34:07.850 --> 05:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
does it look like for them to live you
 
05:34:09.770 --> 05:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
know a meaningful life and everyone
 
05:34:11.930 --> 05:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
served on that waiver now I know there
 
05:34:13.368 --> 05:34:13.378 align:start position:0%
are challenges there are individuals
 
05:34:15.350 --> 05:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
with more
 
05:34:17.990 --> 05:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
um robust needs that sometimes could
 
05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
even be uh the behavioral challenges you
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
know they could sometimes be a danger
 
05:34:26.990 --> 05:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
maybe to others and they require maybe
 
05:34:28.730 --> 05:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
even a two to one that type of thing
 
05:34:31.250 --> 05:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
some people end up either like in an
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
emergency room or so on and so forth
 
05:34:33.000 --> 05:34:34.490 align:start position:0%
emergency room or so on and so forth
certainly

05:34:34.490 --> 05:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:34:36.170 --> 05:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
um you know we need to address those
 
05:34:37.730 --> 05:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
things you also talked this morning
 
05:34:39.590 --> 05:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
about bringing some folks back from
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
Florida that you know have been placed
 
05:34:43.788 --> 05:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
there because of the extensive support
 
05:34:46.310 --> 05:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
needs that they require yeah I mean we
 
05:34:47.930 --> 05:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
definitely need to work on how that
 
05:34:49.550 --> 05:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
happens in the state but the way that
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's currently proposed if we were to go
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
a two-tiered waiver and based on the
 
05:34:55.610 --> 05:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
definition service definitions that I
 
05:34:57.470 --> 05:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed and that Kathy reviewed where
 
05:34:59.150 --> 05:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
would Chloe go where would
 
05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
um Kelly go
 
05:35:00.360 --> 05:35:01.190 align:start position:0%
um Kelly go
um

05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:03.470 --> 05:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
it won't allow family families are not
 
05:35:05.650 --> 05:35:05.660 align:start position:0%
written in for that comprehensive waiver
 
05:35:08.030 --> 05:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
I hate creating more buckets because
 
05:35:08.930 --> 05:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be those
 
05:35:10.368 --> 05:35:10.378 align:start position:0%
individuals that aren't going to fall
 
05:35:12.170 --> 05:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
they're going to like be in between or
 
05:35:13.730 --> 05:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
outside of a bucket somewhere and then
 
05:35:15.288 --> 05:35:15.298 align:start position:0%
what do you do
 
05:35:17.390 --> 05:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's my personal opinion as a
 
05:35:19.250 --> 05:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
family member with a 23 year old
 
05:35:22.550 --> 05:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
daughter who has been active in the
 
05:35:26.030 --> 05:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
community support system to have a
 
05:35:27.530 --> 05:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
comprehensive waiver and that we could
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
still continue to put the individual who
 
05:35:33.410 --> 05:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
needs support first and to build a
 
05:35:35.570 --> 05:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
budget based on
 
05:35:38.150 --> 05:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
their individual needs and their hopes
 
05:35:39.948 --> 05:35:39.958 align:start position:0%
and their dreams and what it means to
 
05:35:41.810 --> 05:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
live a meaningful life
 
05:35:43.490 --> 05:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you just have a follow-up on the
 
05:35:46.550 --> 05:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up so what in effect I hate
 
05:35:48.770 --> 05:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
the word one you're talking about a
 
05:35:51.610 --> 05:35:51.620 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered spectrum as opposed to uh
 
05:35:54.170 --> 05:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
it's a comprehensive waiver so that you
 
05:35:56.230 --> 05:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
don't have like you know it's not
 
05:35:59.090 --> 05:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
separated into buckets like well if your
 
05:36:01.730 --> 05:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
sis score is this to this number you
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
fall in this bucket and you know that's
 
05:36:06.110 --> 05:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
a real medical model approach with a
 
05:36:08.448 --> 05:36:08.458 align:start position:0%
medical lens my daughter is a person you
 
05:36:10.190 --> 05:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
know she has a developmental disability
 
05:36:12.110 --> 05:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
she has certain support needs the sis
 
05:36:15.650 --> 05:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
can help inform like maybe some of the
 
05:36:17.330 --> 05:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
supports that she might need to be
 
05:36:20.330 --> 05:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
receiving but to tie that number to a
 
05:36:22.850 --> 05:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
budget and then associate that to you
 
05:36:25.250 --> 05:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
know a capped waiver or you know a
 
05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
choice of one or two
 
05:36:30.850 --> 05:36:30.860 align:start position:0%
RSA 171a as it stands right now
 
05:36:33.610 --> 05:36:33.620 align:start position:0%
it's probably one of the most
 
05:36:37.970 --> 05:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
Progressive statutes here in the United
 
05:36:40.250 --> 05:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
States you know they talk about you know
 
05:36:41.810 --> 05:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
individuals with developmental
 
05:36:44.030 --> 05:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities being able to access
 
05:36:47.448 --> 05:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
service to ameliorate their condition to
 
05:36:49.550 --> 05:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
support their habilitation and their
 
05:36:52.128 --> 05:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
ease even a passage in there that talks
 
05:36:53.810 --> 05:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
about within the bounds of human
 
05:36:56.990 --> 05:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge I think we understand ma'am so
 
05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
to have you know a small finite list and
 
05:37:01.010 --> 05:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
oh you have to check something off which
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
box do you want to check that could
 
05:37:04.910 --> 05:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
really limit people's ability to live
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
their life representative Weber point of
 
05:37:09.890 --> 05:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
procedure Mr chairman uh I think it
 
05:37:11.810 --> 05:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
might be helpful and maybe this has
 
05:37:14.090 --> 05:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
already happened but I am way behind on
 
05:37:16.850 --> 05:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
some of my communications would it be
 
05:37:19.190 --> 05:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
possible perhaps to ask our researcher
 
05:37:22.910 --> 05:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
to do a a memo for us about the
 
05:37:25.010 --> 05:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
two-tiered system so that we could have
 
05:37:27.650 --> 05:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
a baseline of knowledge that that that
 
05:37:29.650 --> 05:37:29.660 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
05:37:34.128 --> 05:37:34.138 align:start position:0%
her experience Christina
 
05:37:36.170 --> 05:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you does that and that will
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
take care of a lot of those questions
 
05:37:40.850 --> 05:37:40.860 align:start position:0%
and it might also tell us who to go to
 
05:37:42.410 --> 05:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
in in the department about what's being
 
05:37:44.878 --> 05:37:46.670 align:start position:0%
in in the department about what's being
contemplated

05:37:46.670 --> 05:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
contemplated
 
05:37:50.150 --> 05:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
and if I may I not meaning to diminish
 
05:38:00.350 --> 05:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
at all your concerns and your concerns
 
05:38:02.510 --> 05:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
about how it's implemented I I do
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
understand those I just I just want to
 
05:38:08.090 --> 05:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
be sure we have really clear information
 
05:38:08.100 --> 05:38:09.770 align:start position:0%
be sure we have really clear information
from

05:38:09.770 --> 05:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:38:13.128 --> 05:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
our researcher and others about where we
 
05:38:14.390 --> 05:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
are now
 
05:38:16.610 --> 05:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the thoughtful approach and
 
05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
you know there are a lot of questions
 
05:38:20.090 --> 05:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
that we've asked and Bureau doesn't have
 
05:38:22.190 --> 05:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
answers to those yet so that's why I
 
05:38:24.288 --> 05:38:24.298 align:start position:0%
support the bill because we need a more
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
specific thoughtful way to
 
05:38:29.390 --> 05:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
seriously consider making this change
 
05:38:31.070 --> 05:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions I see none thank you
 
05:38:37.490 --> 05:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
last person to who has signed up to
 
05:38:40.850 --> 05:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
testify is is Adora Rodriguez legendre
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Council on developmental
 
05:38:43.200 --> 05:38:49.190 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Council on developmental
disabilities

05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:51.708 --> 05:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
hello thank you again to members of the
 
05:38:55.270 --> 05:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing my testimony on
 
05:39:00.288 --> 05:39:00.298 align:start position:0%
HB 317 so if I could just for a moment
 
05:39:02.090 --> 05:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
tell you a little bit more about the DD
 
05:39:04.128 --> 05:39:04.138 align:start position:0%
counselor the developmental disabilities
 
05:39:06.350 --> 05:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
Council we're a federally funded state
 
05:39:10.550 --> 05:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
agency whose membership is at least 60
 
05:39:13.310 --> 05:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
percent people with lived experience and
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
connection to intellectual and
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and this
 
05:39:18.830 --> 05:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
really ensures that the work that we do
 
05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
and the advocacy we do is led by the
 
05:39:25.070 --> 05:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
people most impacted by the decisions
 
05:39:29.390 --> 05:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
made in our service system and so that's
 
05:39:32.030 --> 05:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
also why we are a member on the equality
 
05:39:34.670 --> 05:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
Council and why we think it's so
 
05:39:37.310 --> 05:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that family
 
05:39:39.530 --> 05:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
members and community members are really
 
05:39:41.330 --> 05:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
engaged in a thoughtful and meaningful
 
05:39:44.270 --> 05:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
way when making decisions
 
05:39:44.280 --> 05:39:45.650 align:start position:0%
way when making decisions
so

05:39:45.650 --> 05:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:39:48.830 --> 05:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
um although this I wasn't going to
 
05:39:52.010 --> 05:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
comment on a two-tier waiver system
 
05:39:55.070 --> 05:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
um but since it's come up over and over
 
05:39:57.288 --> 05:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to know that
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
although this work has been tabled you
 
05:40:01.788 --> 05:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
heard from the Department today that
 
05:40:03.890 --> 05:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
they plan to pick it up again this year
 
05:40:08.030 --> 05:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
right and so understanding that
 
05:40:10.310 --> 05:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
um it's a pause and that's exactly the
 
05:40:13.070 --> 05:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
word they use it's a pause on the
 
05:40:14.868 --> 05:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
implementation of this and the
 
05:40:18.288 --> 05:40:18.298 align:start position:0%
development of this system we have
 
05:40:20.990 --> 05:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
significant concerns about whether a
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
two-tiered waiver system is even
 
05:40:23.040 --> 05:40:24.490 align:start position:0%
two-tiered waiver system is even
necessary

05:40:24.490 --> 05:40:24.500 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
they talked about the development of
 
05:40:30.890 --> 05:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
currently happening of service arrays
 
05:40:32.750 --> 05:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
available to individuals with
 
05:40:33.890 --> 05:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
05:40:33.900 --> 05:40:35.030 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
disabilities

05:40:35.030 --> 05:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
05:40:38.948 --> 05:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
so if we are doing true person-centered
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
evaluations on people's needs and
 
05:40:46.310 --> 05:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
providing those supports to People based
 
05:40:48.530 --> 05:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
on their needs why would you need to
 
05:40:50.990 --> 05:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
tier that why not just develop a full
 
05:40:54.170 --> 05:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
array of services and allow an
 
05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
individual to receive the services that
 
05:41:00.830 --> 05:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
they need based on that whatever
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
assessment and tools you're going to use
 
05:41:05.448 --> 05:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
to determine what their needs are to
 
05:41:07.430 --> 05:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
have a meaningful community-based life
 
05:41:08.930 --> 05:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
because that's what we're talking about
 
05:41:10.850 --> 05:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
one that we would also want for
 
05:41:14.510 --> 05:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves right and so
 
05:41:18.230 --> 05:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're all for studying things that have
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
such a huge impact on our system and I
 
05:41:22.970 --> 05:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
just want to address a couple of
 
05:41:25.368 --> 05:41:25.378 align:start position:0%
comments that I heard earlier about some
 
05:41:27.230 --> 05:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
of the other work that's happening and
 
05:41:29.690 --> 05:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
could perhaps the quality Council be a
 
05:41:34.128 --> 05:41:34.138 align:start position:0%
body that helps provide feedback and
 
05:41:37.250 --> 05:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
evaluation of a two-tiered waiver system
 
05:41:39.470 --> 05:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I want to point out that one of the
 
05:41:41.330 --> 05:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
reasons that that other bill was
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
presented here today is because although
 
05:41:47.230 --> 05:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities for feedback
 
05:41:51.050 --> 05:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
are provided it does not necessarily
 
05:41:54.170 --> 05:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
mean that there's going to be an impact
 
05:41:57.530 --> 05:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
on the decisions made and that I think
 
05:42:00.050 --> 05:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
is that piece that we're really talking
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
about here we want to make sure that
 
05:42:06.470 --> 05:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
there are stakeholders on a commission
 
05:42:09.590 --> 05:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
that really one have a really good sense
 
05:42:11.690 --> 05:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
of what the needs of the developmental
 
05:42:15.650 --> 05:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
disabilities Community has but also that
 
05:42:17.930 --> 05:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
half the power and the ability to make
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
decisions like you all do to be able to
 
05:42:21.360 --> 05:42:22.250 align:start position:0%
decisions like you all do to be able to
say

05:42:22.250 --> 05:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:42:25.070 --> 05:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
um this is not a meaningful way to
 
05:42:27.530 --> 05:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
provide services for people in the
 
05:42:31.070 --> 05:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
community and that we may need to go
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
back to the drawing board on this and so
 
05:42:34.910 --> 05:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
you can be getting wrapping up
 
05:42:38.690 --> 05:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
absolutely so actually my testimony is
 
05:42:40.430 --> 05:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
mostly about there are some people
 
05:42:42.288 --> 05:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
missing on this commission if you're
 
05:42:44.448 --> 05:42:44.458 align:start position:0%
going to establish a commission you need
 
05:42:46.190 --> 05:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there are individuals
 
05:42:48.470 --> 05:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
who are receiving services on the
 
05:42:50.650 --> 05:42:50.660 align:start position:0%
commission family members
 
05:42:53.030 --> 05:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
a person from the developmental
 
05:42:53.040 --> 05:42:54.670 align:start position:0%
a person from the developmental
disabilities

05:42:54.670 --> 05:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
05:42:58.368 --> 05:42:58.378 align:start position:0%
Council would be a recommendation I
 
05:43:00.170 --> 05:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
would make again because our membership
 
05:43:02.390 --> 05:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
is comprised of people with disabilities
 
05:43:04.190 --> 05:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
that are directly impacted by the
 
05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
decisions made and then
 
05:43:09.708 --> 05:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
um also a member of the developmental
 
05:43:11.990 --> 05:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
Services quality Council because again
 
05:43:16.368 --> 05:43:16.378 align:start position:0%
we have seen that their input in some
 
05:43:19.310 --> 05:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
cases has been circumvented in decisions
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
that have been made thus far
 
05:43:23.470 --> 05:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
that's it for me thank you questions
 
05:43:25.730 --> 05:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
05:43:28.010 --> 05:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here uh
 
05:43:30.948 --> 05:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
if we were to charge the council with uh
 
05:43:33.230 --> 05:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
working on this project would that meet
 
05:43:35.090 --> 05:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
your needs of having the people in the
 
05:43:36.830 --> 05:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
community appropriately heard
 
05:43:39.650 --> 05:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
so it would but I believe that it would
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
be missing that other piece of the
 
05:43:45.170 --> 05:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
legislative input and the legislative
 
05:43:48.708 --> 05:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
resource to to be able to say
 
05:43:51.530 --> 05:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
you can't do this right because again
 
05:43:53.930 --> 05:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
we've provided input in a number of
 
05:43:56.690 --> 05:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
different ways to the bureau on changes
 
05:43:58.610 --> 05:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
that are being developed in the system
 
05:44:01.368 --> 05:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
and I think that some of those changes
 
05:44:03.590 --> 05:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
need to happen and some of those changes
 
05:44:06.310 --> 05:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
are optional and it's it's about
 
05:44:09.890 --> 05:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
families not only being heard but that
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
their input is the most valuable for
 
05:44:15.230 --> 05:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
implementing changes and I think that's
 
05:44:17.030 --> 05:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
the piece that we haven't seen really
 
05:44:19.788 --> 05:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
been taken into consideration follow-up
 
05:44:21.890 --> 05:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you and as follow-up then if we
 
05:44:23.690 --> 05:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
had the council write a report on this
 
05:44:26.628 --> 05:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
and provide it to the this committee The
 
05:44:28.368 --> 05:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
Joint Committee of oversight and the
 
05:44:29.390 --> 05:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Health and Human Services
 
05:44:32.330 --> 05:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
committee with that and make it so that
 
05:44:33.470 --> 05:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
you feel that your voices are being
 
05:44:35.208 --> 05:44:35.218 align:start position:0%
heard by us of the legislature so that
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
we can take action I mean I definitely
 
05:44:40.190 --> 05:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
think as long as there's a commitment
 
05:44:43.250 --> 05:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
from the legislature to take that
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
information really provide thoughtful
 
05:44:48.650 --> 05:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
evaluation and create future legislation
 
05:44:52.368 --> 05:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
around those that input yes
 
05:44:56.090 --> 05:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.128 --> 05:44:58.138 align:start position:0%

Murphy for bringing us the amendment um
 
06:00:37.430 --> 06:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
initially in order to take the findings
 
06:00:39.128 --> 06:00:39.138 align:start position:0%
of the pfas and the environmental talk
 
06:00:42.530 --> 06:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
environmental disease uh work groups to
 
06:00:44.330 --> 06:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
be able to move this forward and I'd
 
06:00:46.490 --> 06:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
also like to thank her for working with
 
06:00:49.250 --> 06:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
me in the department to draft a language
 
06:00:52.010 --> 06:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
where we can appropriate the the money
 
06:00:54.830 --> 06:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's required but also yes it was
 
06:00:56.448 --> 06:00:56.458 align:start position:0%
seconded by Weber
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
um sorry so that we can we can make it
 
06:01:01.368 --> 06:01:01.378 align:start position:0%
so that the department is seeking out
 
06:01:04.490 --> 06:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
grants from the CDC NIH or other grants
 
06:01:04.500 --> 06:01:05.628 align:start position:0%
grants from the CDC NIH or other grants
first

06:01:05.628 --> 06:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
first
 
06:01:07.548 --> 06:01:07.558 align:start position:0%
and they can't access the funds until
 
06:01:09.230 --> 06:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's approved by the oversight committee
 
06:01:11.530 --> 06:01:11.540 align:start position:0%
so that this is actually a feasible plan
 
06:01:14.270 --> 06:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
if they're unable to find grant funding
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
then they'll have access to those funds
 
06:01:18.530 --> 06:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
if they do find grant funding then that
 
06:01:21.410 --> 06:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
500 000 would go into a non-lapsing fund
 
06:01:23.690 --> 06:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
so that it can move toward forwards
 
06:01:26.510 --> 06:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
towards additional phases this is a way
 
06:01:28.190 --> 06:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it can move forward
 
06:01:30.230 --> 06:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
but we're able to maximize on what's
 
06:01:31.910 --> 06:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
already happening on this exact same
 
06:01:34.850 --> 06:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
issue nationally and I hope that this
 
06:01:37.730 --> 06:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
can have everyone's support
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:43.010 --> 06:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
seeing no discussion
 
06:01:44.868 --> 06:01:44.878 align:start position:0%

on the consent calendar Mr chairman I
 
06:04:58.670 --> 06:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe it can because it contains
 
06:05:00.470 --> 06:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
an appropriation I think it has to go on
 
06:05:02.330 --> 06:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
the regular calendar okay thank you
 
06:05:06.470 --> 06:05:06.480 align:start position:0%

06:05:44.090 --> 06:05:44.100 align:start position:0%

06:05:48.708 --> 06:05:48.718 align:start position:0%

I think I've seen that either you
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it either yes zero one six
 
06:05:54.000 --> 06:05:55.368 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it either yes zero one six
zero

06:05:55.368 --> 06:05:55.378 align:start position:0%
zero
 
06:05:59.270 --> 06:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:01.368 --> 06:06:01.378 align:start position:0%
the clerk doesn't have it either
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:14.270 --> 06:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay so you're moving this amendment
 
06:06:15.770 --> 06:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro always have a
 
06:06:19.010 --> 06:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'll second it
 
06:06:25.670 --> 06:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:27.470 --> 06:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your emotion
 
06:06:30.430 --> 06:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
06:06:32.510 --> 06:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
yes I will
 
06:06:35.150 --> 06:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
um the amendment does one thing and one
 
06:06:37.690 --> 06:06:37.700 align:start position:0%
thing only it changes the appropriation
 
06:06:40.490 --> 06:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a numbered bill in
 
06:06:42.170 --> 06:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
front of me but
 
06:06:45.350 --> 06:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
um in part two of the original bill it
 
06:06:47.750 --> 06:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
calls for an appropriation of a hundred
 
06:06:49.690 --> 06:06:49.700 align:start position:0%
and eighteen thousand dollars
 
06:06:52.788 --> 06:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal year ending June 30th
 
06:06:57.708 --> 06:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
2024 and this was a result this is the
 
06:06:59.448 --> 06:06:59.458 align:start position:0%
exact same thing that was taken from the
 
06:07:01.788 --> 06:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
bill I
 
06:07:03.410 --> 06:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
um submitted last year
 
06:07:05.448 --> 06:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:07:08.390 --> 06:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
um now that we're in a different year we
 
06:07:10.910 --> 06:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
need to cover 18 months until the end of
 
06:07:12.890 --> 06:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
the biennium the bill would go into
 
06:07:17.390 --> 06:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
effect January 1st 2024 and we need to
 
06:07:21.470 --> 06:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
cover 18 months as opposed to six months
 
06:07:23.090 --> 06:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
that we would have had a cover had the
 
06:07:24.970 --> 06:07:24.980 align:start position:0%
bill passed last year
 
06:07:27.890 --> 06:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because OLS seemed to be
 
06:07:29.628 --> 06:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
so backed up I couldn't get them to
 
06:07:32.208 --> 06:07:32.218 align:start position:0%
change it in time so the amount of the
 
06:07:35.090 --> 06:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
new appropriation is 336 thousand
 
06:07:38.570 --> 06:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
dollars to cover an 18-month period And
 
06:07:41.448 --> 06:07:41.458 align:start position:0%
if you look at the
 
06:07:43.250 --> 06:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
um fiscal note
 
06:07:45.470 --> 06:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's totally consistent
 
06:07:49.850 --> 06:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal note which is 224 000 in
 
06:07:51.230 --> 06:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
state funds
 
06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
for 2024 and the same for 2025 that
 
06:08:01.850 --> 06:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
would be 448 000 and 336 000 which is
 
06:08:03.470 --> 06:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
the new appropriation would be three
 
06:08:06.288 --> 06:08:06.298 align:start position:0%
quarters of the 18 months worth
 
06:08:09.830 --> 06:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
so I would ask you to
 
06:08:12.110 --> 06:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
um vote to adopt this
 
06:08:12.120 --> 06:08:13.010 align:start position:0%
um vote to adopt this
um

06:08:13.010 --> 06:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:15.110 --> 06:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
so we can get on with talking about the
 
06:08:17.030 --> 06:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
actual bill
 
06:08:18.770 --> 06:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on this
 
06:08:18.780 --> 06:08:22.730 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on this
amendment

06:08:22.730 --> 06:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:25.128 --> 06:08:25.138 align:start position:0%
okay saying none I will ask the clerk to
 
06:08:27.970 --> 06:08:27.980 align:start position:0%
call a roll a motion is ought to pass
 
06:08:35.810 --> 06:08:35.820 align:start position:0%

06:09:59.930 --> 06:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
that we
 
06:10:02.868 --> 06:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
um vote ought to pass as amended by
 
06:10:07.548 --> 06:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0160 on House Bill 282. okay
 
06:10:09.708 --> 06:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
is there a second second
 
06:10:12.170 --> 06:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant seconds
 
06:10:13.850 --> 06:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
06:10:15.350 --> 06:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative Chipotle do you want to
 
06:10:18.110 --> 06:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
speak to emotion or yes I do
 
06:10:18.120 --> 06:10:20.690 align:start position:0%
speak to emotion or yes I do
so

06:10:20.690 --> 06:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:23.270 --> 06:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons why I would hope
 
06:10:25.850 --> 06:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
that we would pass this bill the first
 
06:10:28.788 --> 06:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
one is the kind of investment in
 
06:10:31.250 --> 06:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
families and in child and maternal
 
06:10:31.260 --> 06:10:32.690 align:start position:0%
families and in child and maternal
Health

06:10:32.690 --> 06:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
Health
 
06:10:35.030 --> 06:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
um there's a bunch of research that I
 
06:10:37.090 --> 06:10:37.100 align:start position:0%
found on this but
 
06:10:40.910 --> 06:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
research shows that children and
 
06:10:40.920 --> 06:10:43.610 align:start position:0%
research shows that children and
um

06:10:43.610 --> 06:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:46.010 --> 06:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
pregnant women who do not are not
 
06:10:46.020 --> 06:10:47.410 align:start position:0%
pregnant women who do not are not
covered

06:10:47.410 --> 06:10:47.420 align:start position:0%
covered
 
06:10:50.448 --> 06:10:50.458 align:start position:0%
receive less care and that that results
 
06:10:54.830 --> 06:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
in delayed treatment for children and an
 
06:10:56.448 --> 06:10:56.458 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
06:10:56.458 --> 06:10:58.430 align:start position:0%
increase in
um

06:10:58.430 --> 06:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
low birth weights and infant mortality
 
06:11:02.990 --> 06:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
for pregnant women
 
06:11:03.000 --> 06:11:04.128 align:start position:0%
for pregnant women
um

06:11:04.128 --> 06:11:04.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lot of specific
 
06:11:08.448 --> 06:11:08.458 align:start position:0%
research but I my main point really is
 
06:11:10.490 --> 06:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
that it's a good investment in families
 
06:11:12.110 --> 06:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
and in Children And getting people off
 
06:11:15.470 --> 06:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
to the right start I think one aspect an
 
06:11:19.090 --> 06:11:19.100 align:start position:0%
important aspect of this bill is that
 
06:11:21.708 --> 06:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
welcoming immigrants to New Hampshire is
 
06:11:23.930 --> 06:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
is certainly not going to solve our
 
06:11:26.448 --> 06:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
Workforce Problem by any means but it's
 
06:11:30.110 --> 06:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
one small part that we can do to
 
06:11:30.120 --> 06:11:31.670 align:start position:0%
one small part that we can do to
um

06:11:31.670 --> 06:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:34.490 --> 06:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
to create a more vibrant and greater
 
06:11:36.230 --> 06:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
Workforce and I just want to talk about
 
06:11:39.048 --> 06:11:39.058 align:start position:0%
one person I met in the course of
 
06:11:41.270 --> 06:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
researching this bill someone directed
 
06:11:43.850 --> 06:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
me to this fellow who was vice president
 
06:11:46.730 --> 06:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
of pitco friellator anybody know pitco
 
06:11:49.910 --> 06:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
friellator it's evidently a
 
06:11:53.390 --> 06:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Company in Concord I'd
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
never heard of it and it's
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
um they make friolators for McDonald's
 
06:12:00.350 --> 06:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
all over the world and they were really
 
06:12:02.330 --> 06:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic they were really
 
06:12:05.948 --> 06:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
really hurting in terms of Workforce and
 
06:12:08.750 --> 06:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
someone suggested to them that they hire
 
06:12:11.868 --> 06:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
four of the Afghan evacuees who had been
 
06:12:14.990 --> 06:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
brought to Concord and they did that as
 
06:12:17.330 --> 06:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
a kind of a
 
06:12:19.430 --> 06:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
06:12:20.510 --> 06:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:12:23.410 --> 06:12:23.420 align:start position:0%
um when I spoke to the vice president
 
06:12:26.330 --> 06:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
the Afghan evacuees had been here for
 
06:12:28.430 --> 06:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
about nine months and they had hired 40
 
06:12:31.128 --> 06:12:31.138 align:start position:0%
Afghan evacuees and they were in the
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
process of figuring out how they could
 
06:12:33.120 --> 06:12:34.490 align:start position:0%
process of figuring out how they could
create

06:12:34.490 --> 06:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
create
 
06:12:37.448 --> 06:12:37.458 align:start position:0%
um a room where people could pray since
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
Muslims pray five times a day they felt
 
06:12:43.610 --> 06:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
like that had really been salvaged their
 
06:12:43.620 --> 06:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
like that had really been salvaged their
Workforce

06:12:45.110 --> 06:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
06:12:47.208 --> 06:12:47.218 align:start position:0%
so once again I don't think it's the
 
06:12:49.368 --> 06:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
solution to Workforce but we certainly
 
06:12:50.810 --> 06:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
don't want to hang out a sign that's
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
saying we're the only state in the
 
06:12:56.150 --> 06:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
Northeast that doesn't have this program
 
06:12:58.788 --> 06:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
that welcomes immigrants
 
06:13:01.010 --> 06:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
I also just wanted to comment briefly
 
06:13:04.430 --> 06:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
about some of the comments that came up
 
06:13:07.250 --> 06:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
during the hearing about
 
06:13:07.260 --> 06:13:07.970 align:start position:0%
during the hearing about
um

06:13:07.970 --> 06:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:11.570 --> 06:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
the ACA and um why can't these people
 
06:13:13.430 --> 06:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
just get insurance through the
 
06:13:16.730 --> 06:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act and um
 
06:13:19.490 --> 06:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
certainly some immigrants can get
 
06:13:19.500 --> 06:13:21.890 align:start position:0%
certainly some immigrants can get
um

06:13:21.890 --> 06:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:24.230 --> 06:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
get health care coverage through the
 
06:13:26.090 --> 06:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act but I want to just
 
06:13:28.670 --> 06:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
kind of give you an example of people
 
06:13:30.948 --> 06:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
who can't we talked a lot about or I
 
06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about how
 
06:13:33.120 --> 06:13:33.830 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about how
um

06:13:33.830 --> 06:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:37.548 --> 06:13:37.558 align:start position:0%
you know this was not a a binary
 
06:13:40.128 --> 06:13:40.138 align:start position:0%
situation between documented people and
 
06:13:42.350 --> 06:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
undocumented and while all these people
 
06:13:44.510 --> 06:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
have to be lawfully residing there are
 
06:13:45.948 --> 06:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
all kinds of lawfully residing
 
06:13:48.288 --> 06:13:48.298 align:start position:0%
immigrants so let me just give you the
 
06:13:50.810 --> 06:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
example of a family that moved to Keene
 
06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
my hometown
 
06:13:54.770 --> 06:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
um this was a family who entered the
 
06:13:58.368 --> 06:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
country and immediately asked for Asylum
 
06:14:01.548 --> 06:14:01.558 align:start position:0%
they were in Texas they found a family
 
06:14:03.530 --> 06:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
who would spot a group and a family who
 
06:14:05.930 --> 06:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
would sponsor them in Keene they were a
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
family of a married couple and three
 
06:14:09.600 --> 06:14:10.610 align:start position:0%
family of a married couple and three
children

06:14:10.610 --> 06:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:14:13.850 --> 06:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
so they moved to Keene either before
 
06:14:16.610 --> 06:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
they moved to Keene or right after they
 
06:14:18.530 --> 06:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
got came to Keene they got legal
 
06:14:20.930 --> 06:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
assistance and they
 
06:14:24.910 --> 06:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
um made application for Asylum
 
06:14:27.708 --> 06:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
in order to make application for Asylum
 
06:14:30.048 --> 06:14:30.058 align:start position:0%
you have to pass a credible fear
 
06:14:32.448 --> 06:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
interview which means that there's a
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
good chance that you will get Asylum
 
06:14:36.350 --> 06:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
because you're coming from a country
 
06:14:39.048 --> 06:14:39.058 align:start position:0%
where if you went back you would be in
 
06:14:41.030 --> 06:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
danger of
 
06:14:41.040 --> 06:14:42.948 align:start position:0%
danger of
um

06:14:42.948 --> 06:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:45.650 --> 06:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
of being killed because of religious
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
persecution or because of political
 
06:14:49.610 --> 06:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
persecution of or because of gang
 
06:14:49.620 --> 06:14:51.410 align:start position:0%
persecution of or because of gang
activity

06:14:51.410 --> 06:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
activity
 
06:14:53.628 --> 06:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
so these are people that are not coming
 
06:14:55.548 --> 06:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
just because they
 
06:14:55.558 --> 06:14:56.390 align:start position:0%
just because they
um

06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:58.190 --> 06:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
want to get Medicaid they're people who
 
06:15:00.350 --> 06:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
are coming because their situation is
 
06:15:01.730 --> 06:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
really bleak
 
06:15:04.730 --> 06:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
so so for this family of three children
 
06:15:06.770 --> 06:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:15:08.930 --> 06:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
a mother and a father
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes and if the five-year
 
06:15:16.368 --> 06:15:16.378 align:start position:0%
wait is waived these children would have
 
06:15:21.070 --> 06:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:23.810 --> 06:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
180 days after they made their initial
 
06:15:23.820 --> 06:15:25.910 align:start position:0%
180 days after they made their initial
application

06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
application
 
06:15:29.090 --> 06:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
the mom if she was pregnant would have
 
06:15:31.090 --> 06:15:31.100 align:start position:0%
been eligible for
 
06:15:35.330 --> 06:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
Medicaid after her work permit was given
 
06:15:36.890 --> 06:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
which is something that usually happens
 
06:15:39.890 --> 06:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
about halfway between when somebody
 
06:15:42.230 --> 06:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
applies for Asylum and when they have
 
06:15:43.850 --> 06:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
their final hearing where they will
 
06:15:46.010 --> 06:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
either get Asylum or not
 
06:15:48.890 --> 06:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
so in this particular case not relevant
 
06:15:50.208 --> 06:15:50.218 align:start position:0%
for the woman because she wasn't
 
06:15:52.730 --> 06:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
pregnant but these three children would
 
06:15:55.128 --> 06:15:55.138 align:start position:0%
have had Medicaid
 
06:15:57.110 --> 06:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
they've been here for almost three years
 
06:16:01.430 --> 06:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
now and um they would have had Medicaid
 
06:16:04.030 --> 06:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
um two and a two and a half years ago
 
06:16:07.910 --> 06:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
whereas medical providers in Keene have
 
06:16:10.548 --> 06:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
been providing unreimbursed services for
 
06:16:10.558 --> 06:16:11.628 align:start position:0%
been providing unreimbursed services for
them

06:16:11.628 --> 06:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:16:14.030 --> 06:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
um because that's their value and
 
06:16:16.368 --> 06:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
because they step forward to do that so
 
06:16:17.990 --> 06:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's an example
 
06:16:21.430 --> 06:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
um of people who would not be able to
 
06:16:24.650 --> 06:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
access the Affordable Care Act because
 
06:16:27.948 --> 06:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
they really came with nothing and with
 
06:16:31.150 --> 06:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
no money and with no possessions
 
06:16:33.110 --> 06:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
people who come through family
 
06:16:36.410 --> 06:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
unification where family may have some
 
06:16:39.410 --> 06:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
more resources those people possibly
 
06:16:44.270 --> 06:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:46.610 --> 06:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
in in summary this bill will ease the
 
06:16:48.650 --> 06:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
eligibility for a small number perhaps
 
06:16:51.230 --> 06:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
300 children and pregnant women all of
 
06:16:53.270 --> 06:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
who were lawfully residing in this state
 
06:16:56.110 --> 06:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
at a reasonable cost to our state
 
06:16:58.850 --> 06:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
no undocumented immigrants will be
 
06:17:01.610 --> 06:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
eligible under this option
 
06:17:04.490 --> 06:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
and so I would urge you to
 
06:17:04.500 --> 06:17:05.690 align:start position:0%
and so I would urge you to
vote

06:17:05.690 --> 06:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
vote
 
06:17:09.048 --> 06:17:09.058 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on 282.
 
06:17:11.390 --> 06:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion
 
06:17:15.530 --> 06:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative Leon representative King
 
06:17:17.530 --> 06:17:17.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald
 
06:17:20.690 --> 06:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like to speak against voting for
 
06:17:24.110 --> 06:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
this bill I vote for itl
 
06:17:26.690 --> 06:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
so you should all know me by now that
 
06:17:28.788 --> 06:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
I'm against the welfare state
 
06:17:30.830 --> 06:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm against it for a philosophical and
 
06:17:32.810 --> 06:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
economic reasons which I won't bore you
 
06:17:34.250 --> 06:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
with again
 
06:17:37.850 --> 06:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
but secondly as far as immigration is
 
06:17:37.860 --> 06:17:39.070 align:start position:0%
but secondly as far as immigration is
concerned

06:17:39.070 --> 06:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
06:17:42.410 --> 06:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
I don't like the entitlement mentality
 
06:17:45.230 --> 06:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
that exists even amongst Americans in
 
06:17:46.150 --> 06:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
this country
 
06:17:48.830 --> 06:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that's in large part due to
 
06:17:51.548 --> 06:17:51.558 align:start position:0%
the entitlement state that we have
 
06:17:54.048 --> 06:17:54.058 align:start position:0%
I don't believe people are entitled to
 
06:17:56.150 --> 06:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
all of these things these are things
 
06:17:58.730 --> 06:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
that we need to work for and learn to
 
06:18:00.288 --> 06:18:00.298 align:start position:0%
live within our means and strive for
 
06:18:02.330 --> 06:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
it's not something that you're entitled
 
06:18:05.570 --> 06:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
to based on other people's taxes
 
06:18:05.580 --> 06:18:07.070 align:start position:0%
to based on other people's taxes
secondly

06:18:07.070 --> 06:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
06:18:08.690 --> 06:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
um you know a few years ago we had a
 
06:18:10.010 --> 06:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
presidential candidate I'm not sure
 
06:18:11.390 --> 06:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
exactly where I went but he was talking
 
06:18:13.250 --> 06:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
about how we really don't want
 
06:18:15.470 --> 06:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
immigrants in this country that uh are
 
06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to be dependent on freebies in
 
06:18:19.670 --> 06:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
fact he was talking about we should get
 
06:18:22.250 --> 06:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
rid of green cards and
 
06:18:24.048 --> 06:18:24.058 align:start position:0%
um allowing immigrants that are going to
 
06:18:25.730 --> 06:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
be here dependent on freebies if you
 
06:18:26.990 --> 06:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
they couldn't stand on their own they
 
06:18:28.368 --> 06:18:28.378 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be here and I agree with that
 
06:18:30.530 --> 06:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
completely matter of fact we have three
 
06:18:32.868 --> 06:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
immigrants on this board who I'm pretty
 
06:18:34.250 --> 06:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
sure came here not because of the
 
06:18:37.670 --> 06:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
freebies but for the freedom the freedom
 
06:18:40.910 --> 06:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
from overburden some taxes and uh the
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
welfare state that they ran away from in
 
06:18:44.930 --> 06:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
their own country
 
06:18:46.970 --> 06:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
06:18:49.250 --> 06:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'm against it for all of those
 
06:18:51.170 --> 06:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
reasons if you want to talk about
 
06:18:53.448 --> 06:18:53.458 align:start position:0%
immigrants who come here with nothing we
 
06:18:54.770 --> 06:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
should think about the people that came
 
06:18:56.390 --> 06:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
here on the Mayflower I mean these
 
06:18:57.530 --> 06:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
people had nothing
 
06:19:00.410 --> 06:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
and uh and they were fleeing uh
 
06:19:02.570 --> 06:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
religious persecution so but they didn't
 
06:19:05.510 --> 06:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
have an entitlement uh welfare system to
 
06:19:07.430 --> 06:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
come to and they built the greatest
 
06:19:09.530 --> 06:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
country that ever lived so I totally
 
06:19:11.810 --> 06:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
reject the idea that somebody who is
 
06:19:14.868 --> 06:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
needy has to depend only on the state
 
06:19:16.368 --> 06:19:16.378 align:start position:0%
this is something that could be done
 
06:19:18.650 --> 06:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
through voluntary charity it can be done
 
06:19:20.510 --> 06:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
through the marketplace it does not need
 
06:19:23.150 --> 06:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
to be done through government large s i
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
reject that wholeheartedly and I will do
 
06:19:27.350 --> 06:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
that for all bills similar to this thank
 
06:19:32.330 --> 06:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
06:19:35.690 --> 06:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
um I think it's very interesting that we
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
started off this discussion about
 
06:19:39.650 --> 06:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
welcoming immigrants and I'm opposed to
 
06:19:41.570 --> 06:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
this bill because the way that I want to
 
06:19:43.548 --> 06:19:43.558 align:start position:0%
welcome immigrants isn't by making them
 
06:19:45.770 --> 06:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
rely on the state which happens in too
 
06:19:47.868 --> 06:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
many other countries in the world but to
 
06:19:49.670 --> 06:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that our community is
 
06:19:52.490 --> 06:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
empowered and enabled to welcome our
 
06:19:54.830 --> 06:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
newest Neighbors in we should be doing
 
06:19:56.628 --> 06:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
that through employers who are hiring
 
06:19:58.010 --> 06:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
them making sure that they're offering
 
06:19:59.570 --> 06:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
benefits and making sure that we have
 
06:20:02.208 --> 06:20:02.218 align:start position:0%
systems where people can contribute to
 
06:20:03.948 --> 06:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
their care or offer that through direct
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
primary if people supported these
 
06:20:07.610 --> 06:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
families in direct primary that would
 
06:20:10.368 --> 06:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
work we heard a bill earlier where if it
 
06:20:12.590 --> 06:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
was amended so that we could have people
 
06:20:14.750 --> 06:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
contribute money to provide care for
 
06:20:16.430 --> 06:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
people that would be an option in places
 
06:20:18.650 --> 06:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
like birthing centers I want to welcome
 
06:20:20.570 --> 06:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
immigrants and I want to welcome them
 
06:20:23.330 --> 06:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
into a community that doesn't just say
 
06:20:24.650 --> 06:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
here's a government that's going to help
 
06:20:27.288 --> 06:20:27.298 align:start position:0%
you but says hi I'm your neighbor and
 
06:20:29.690 --> 06:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to help you so that's why I'm
 
06:20:31.368 --> 06:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill although I
 
06:20:32.750 --> 06:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate we're all trying to get
 
06:20:34.010 --> 06:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
to the same thing just just in different
 
06:20:34.020 --> 06:20:39.830 align:start position:0%
to the same thing just just in different
ways

06:20:39.830 --> 06:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:41.390 --> 06:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to respond to a couple of
 
06:20:43.368 --> 06:20:43.378 align:start position:0%
things it may not change anyone's mind
 
06:20:46.190 --> 06:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
but in regards to taxes
 
06:20:47.990 --> 06:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is these people are
 
06:20:50.090 --> 06:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
employed gainfully and therefore they're
 
06:20:51.890 --> 06:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
paying taxes but they're getting nothing
 
06:20:53.690 --> 06:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
in return for it
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
in regards to the Mayflower
 
06:20:58.010 --> 06:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't for the benefit of the
 
06:20:59.990 --> 06:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
Indians who are here
 
06:21:01.490 --> 06:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
they probably wouldn't have survived
 
06:21:03.288 --> 06:21:03.298 align:start position:0%
because they had a safety net around
 
06:21:05.208 --> 06:21:05.218 align:start position:0%
them to help them get through some hard
 
06:21:05.218 --> 06:21:06.770 align:start position:0%
them to help them get through some hard
times

06:21:06.770 --> 06:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
times
 
06:21:08.868 --> 06:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
in regards to looking at
 
06:21:11.750 --> 06:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
the policy itself not the economics of
 
06:21:11.760 --> 06:21:12.650 align:start position:0%
the policy itself not the economics of
it

06:21:12.650 --> 06:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:21:14.570 --> 06:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
it's only falafly
 
06:21:17.090 --> 06:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
rise adding people awfully residing in
 
06:21:18.650 --> 06:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
the United States so I'll just leave you
 
06:21:20.628 --> 06:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
those things is that I'm not talking
 
06:21:21.890 --> 06:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
about the illegal aliens not talking
 
06:21:23.150 --> 06:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
about DACA workers they're talking about
 
06:21:25.430 --> 06:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
people here lawfully
 
06:21:27.170 --> 06:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
they pay taxes
 
06:21:29.208 --> 06:21:29.218 align:start position:0%
and don't forget the Mayflower was
 
06:21:34.090 --> 06:21:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:36.590 --> 06:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
support if you will of the American
 
06:21:36.600 --> 06:21:41.090 align:start position:0%
support if you will of the American
Indians

06:21:41.090 --> 06:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:42.770 --> 06:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:21:46.670 --> 06:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Cushman sorry
 
06:21:48.650 --> 06:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
06:21:51.410 --> 06:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
Coachman representative McLean sorry
 
06:21:51.420 --> 06:21:52.128 align:start position:0%
Coachman representative McLean sorry
um

06:21:52.128 --> 06:21:52.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:55.010 --> 06:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make note that the
 
06:21:56.628 --> 06:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
difference between the Native Americans
 
06:22:01.310 --> 06:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
helping us and the welfare state that um
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
was referred to earlier is that one is
 
06:22:03.600 --> 06:22:05.628 align:start position:0%
was referred to earlier is that one is
voluntary

06:22:05.628 --> 06:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
06:22:07.910 --> 06:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
they helped voluntarily and the others
 
06:22:11.448 --> 06:22:11.458 align:start position:0%
through taxation which is forced
 
06:22:14.208 --> 06:22:14.218 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
06:22:15.948 --> 06:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:22:18.048 --> 06:22:18.058 align:start position:0%
um I you know representative Shapiro
 
06:22:20.208 --> 06:22:20.218 align:start position:0%
when when you tell me your story it
 
06:22:22.190 --> 06:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
really touches my heart
 
06:22:24.830 --> 06:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
um one of my best friends is an Iranian
 
06:22:27.110 --> 06:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
immigrant who came over under just those
 
06:22:29.990 --> 06:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances her uncle was beheaded
 
06:22:32.868 --> 06:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
um you know when the when the Shah fell
 
06:22:35.890 --> 06:22:35.900 align:start position:0%
and so they came over here with nothing
 
06:22:39.470 --> 06:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
and her contribution to this country in
 
06:22:41.628 --> 06:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
in the decade sense has I think just
 
06:22:44.090 --> 06:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
been incredible so I have a lot of
 
06:22:46.670 --> 06:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
sympathy uh with what you're saying but
 
06:22:49.368 --> 06:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
I really think that as these people are
 
06:22:51.890 --> 06:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
coming in they bring enormous value but
 
06:22:55.310 --> 06:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
we we seem to be just adopting this one
 
06:22:56.810 --> 06:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
approach and that is we're putting them
 
06:22:58.970 --> 06:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
all into Medicaid we just heard
 
06:23:01.490 --> 06:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
testimony today about how the critical
 
06:23:04.310 --> 06:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
access hospitals Etc they're all on the
 
06:23:06.890 --> 06:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
verge of breaking and I really think
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we have to be looking at other
 
06:23:12.170 --> 06:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
approaches as to how we integrate these
 
06:23:14.208 --> 06:23:14.218 align:start position:0%
very valuable people into our community
 
06:23:15.708 --> 06:23:15.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
 
06:23:19.850 --> 06:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:23:22.368 --> 06:23:22.378 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm kind of wondering actually
 
06:23:24.708 --> 06:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
who are writing this bill for because I
 
06:23:27.230 --> 06:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
as I talked to a variety of people and
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
there is somebody from the New Hampshire
 
06:23:31.010 --> 06:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association here who I'm
 
06:23:34.730 --> 06:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
staring at right now but but um you know
 
06:23:37.430 --> 06:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
the initial thought is is the immigrants
 
06:23:41.208 --> 06:23:41.218 align:start position:0%
we we had a um a plan the Lutheran
 
06:23:42.770 --> 06:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
society that they would bring immigrants
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
here they've got eight months of
 
06:23:45.830 --> 06:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I'm not sure how they swung
 
06:23:48.410 --> 06:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
that and then they're on their own
 
06:23:49.970 --> 06:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
um most of the people that you had
 
06:23:52.670 --> 06:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
talked about the pipco folks they
 
06:23:54.110 --> 06:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
actually get health insurance through
 
06:23:56.448 --> 06:23:56.458 align:start position:0%
pitco so they've actually gone from this
 
06:23:58.070 --> 06:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
stage to actually being functional
 
06:23:59.690 --> 06:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
members whatever that means of society
 
06:24:01.970 --> 06:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
but that's not what the issue that
 
06:24:03.530 --> 06:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
started to make me think a little
 
06:24:05.208 --> 06:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
differently about this
 
06:24:06.890 --> 06:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about hospitals in
 
06:24:09.410 --> 06:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
danger and I would probably asked our
 
06:24:11.390 --> 06:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
two other doctors to maybe comment on
 
06:24:12.530 --> 06:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
this because you work in hospital
 
06:24:15.230 --> 06:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
settings and I don't but they're going
 
06:24:17.030 --> 06:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
to get care one way or the other
 
06:24:18.708 --> 06:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
you know there it's either going to get
 
06:24:20.390 --> 06:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
paid care or not paid care and these
 
06:24:21.590 --> 06:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
people are going to go to the hospital
 
06:24:23.030 --> 06:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the hospital is going to eat that
 
06:24:25.430 --> 06:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
care so in the end it wasn't clear
 
06:24:27.410 --> 06:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
whether this bill to me was going to
 
06:24:30.230 --> 06:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
benefit the immigrants as much as it
 
06:24:32.030 --> 06:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
would benefit the hospitals and I would
 
06:24:33.890 --> 06:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
really love to hear your thoughts about
 
06:24:33.900 --> 06:24:34.850 align:start position:0%
really love to hear your thoughts about
that

06:24:34.850 --> 06:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:24:36.830 --> 06:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
um because you deal with that issue a
 
06:24:38.390 --> 06:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
lot more than I do
 
06:24:40.368 --> 06:24:40.378 align:start position:0%
um but that was that was the point of
 
06:24:41.930 --> 06:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
view that made me think about this a
 
06:24:43.310 --> 06:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
little differently
 
06:24:44.868 --> 06:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
representative King and then
 
06:24:46.190 --> 06:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro are you ready to
 
06:24:49.810 --> 06:24:49.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:53.150 --> 06:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
oh yeah although this may confuse some
 
06:24:55.368 --> 06:24:55.378 align:start position:0%
of you I'm actually going to vote for
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
06:25:00.410 --> 06:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm on and the reason is Con it will
 
06:25:02.270 --> 06:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
be confusing is because I'm actually on
 
06:25:04.368 --> 06:25:04.378 align:start position:0%
the same plane as what uh representative
 
06:25:07.070 --> 06:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
Seth King mentioned
 
06:25:09.110 --> 06:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
um maybe not in as strong a terms but
 
06:25:11.690 --> 06:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not a big fan of creating more
 
06:25:14.448 --> 06:25:14.458 align:start position:0%
programs and I'm not a fan of you know
 
06:25:17.810 --> 06:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid extension but to what
 
06:25:19.970 --> 06:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative menagle said you know
 
06:25:22.788 --> 06:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to be paying
 
06:25:26.510 --> 06:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
for this whether it's uh whether it's
 
06:25:29.090 --> 06:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
through the emergency room and they and
 
06:25:31.490 --> 06:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
the hospital eats it or whether we pay
 
06:25:34.970 --> 06:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
for it through Medicaid and
 
06:25:34.980 --> 06:25:35.868 align:start position:0%
for it through Medicaid and
um

06:25:35.868 --> 06:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:35.878 --> 06:25:36.948 align:start position:0%
um
oh

06:25:36.948 --> 06:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:25:39.350 --> 06:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
the other the other thing I see this as
 
06:25:42.770 --> 06:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
is kind of a pro-life look at things
 
06:25:44.628 --> 06:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
where we're actually here to help the
 
06:25:48.410 --> 06:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
mother during her pregnancy and so I see
 
06:25:51.948 --> 06:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
this I see this in a way of helping the
 
06:25:53.390 --> 06:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
unborn child
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
and uh the last thing I'll say and this
 
06:25:59.090 --> 06:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
is actually where my blood starts to
 
06:26:01.970 --> 06:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
boil a little bit is that
 
06:26:01.980 --> 06:26:02.510 align:start position:0%
boil a little bit is that
um

06:26:02.510 --> 06:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:04.430 --> 06:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
quite honestly I wouldn't I don't want
 
06:26:07.190 --> 06:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
to see this taken care of through taxes
 
06:26:09.048 --> 06:26:09.058 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see this taken care of
 
06:26:11.510 --> 06:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
through the churches and I just don't
 
06:26:14.510 --> 06:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
see the church being in a position to to
 
06:26:17.510 --> 06:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
handle the amount of help that these
 
06:26:19.670 --> 06:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
women need we live in a state where only
 
06:26:21.410 --> 06:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
four percent of the people go to church
 
06:26:24.048 --> 06:26:24.058 align:start position:0%
and four percent just isn't enough to
 
06:26:26.270 --> 06:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
support this but maybe in three years
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
from now uh maybe through some of our
 
06:26:32.930 --> 06:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
activity we can actually support the
 
06:26:35.690 --> 06:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
church in a way that that we don't have
 
06:26:38.570 --> 06:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
to rely on tax dollars and so that's why
 
06:26:41.270 --> 06:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
I'm voting for this at this time and I
 
06:26:43.190 --> 06:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
would hope that in three years we don't
 
06:26:45.948 --> 06:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
need this through Medicaid
 
06:26:47.510 --> 06:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
 
06:26:49.430 --> 06:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative Webber thank you Mr
 
06:26:54.170 --> 06:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
chairman I I would urge people to um try
 
06:26:57.230 --> 06:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
to view this in a less than black and
 
06:26:57.240 --> 06:26:58.910 align:start position:0%
to view this in a less than black and
white

06:26:58.910 --> 06:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
white
 
06:27:00.470 --> 06:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
um Viewpoint
 
06:27:00.480 --> 06:27:02.030 align:start position:0%
um Viewpoint
um

06:27:02.030 --> 06:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:06.110 --> 06:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
I actually share people's concern about
 
06:27:06.120 --> 06:27:06.890 align:start position:0%
I actually share people's concern about
um

06:27:06.890 --> 06:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:10.730 --> 06:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or some other benefits
 
06:27:14.570 --> 06:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
um creating or maintaining dependency I
 
06:27:18.490 --> 06:27:18.500 align:start position:0%
worked for years as a psychotherapist
 
06:27:21.170 --> 06:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
mostly with pretty people who were poor
 
06:27:24.170 --> 06:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
and and pretty marginalized not all of
 
06:27:26.270 --> 06:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
them but um some of them had health care
 
06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
through their employers some of them
 
06:27:30.048 --> 06:27:30.058 align:start position:0%
didn't have any health care
 
06:27:33.110 --> 06:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of them had um
 
06:27:36.410 --> 06:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
Healthcare through Medicaid and
 
06:27:36.420 --> 06:27:37.490 align:start position:0%
Healthcare through Medicaid and
um

06:27:37.490 --> 06:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:40.250 --> 06:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
I don't really disagree with you that
 
06:27:45.788 --> 06:27:45.798 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or other benefits can at times
 
06:27:50.510 --> 06:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
maintain a um a dependency I I think
 
06:27:51.948 --> 06:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
there are things we could fix in the
 
06:27:54.730 --> 06:27:54.740 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program that might help that
 
06:27:58.610 --> 06:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
but I would ask you to kind of every
 
06:28:01.610 --> 06:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
Bill week that comes before us has a
 
06:28:03.708 --> 06:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
positive and a negative or many
 
06:28:06.770 --> 06:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
positives and many negatives and
 
06:28:09.048 --> 06:28:09.058 align:start position:0%
um to the degree that anybody who goes
 
06:28:10.310 --> 06:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid
 
06:28:12.948 --> 06:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
becomes dependent on Medicaid and never
 
06:28:15.890 --> 06:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
goes to work and lives
 
06:28:19.010 --> 06:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
um you know a marginal existence that's
 
06:28:21.948 --> 06:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
a bad thing but I would say to you that
 
06:28:25.010 --> 06:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
that's not the case at all for
 
06:28:26.930 --> 06:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
um all the people who go on Medicaid
 
06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
even most of the people who go on
 
06:28:31.730 --> 06:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I don't have the statistics and
 
06:28:33.590 --> 06:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's anybody here who
 
06:28:37.128 --> 06:28:37.138 align:start position:0%
has some but I think many many many
 
06:28:40.010 --> 06:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
people on Medicaid work and work
 
06:28:44.030 --> 06:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
full-time and still qualify for Medicaid
 
06:28:47.150 --> 06:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
um the best of all situations is that
 
06:28:48.890 --> 06:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
it's something that keeps you in good
 
06:28:52.070 --> 06:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
health something that once they're a
 
06:28:54.948 --> 06:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
dental benefit will help you get better
 
06:28:56.690 --> 06:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
teeth so you won't be in pain all the
 
06:28:59.628 --> 06:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
time so that you are able to be a more
 
06:29:01.430 --> 06:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
independent person that you are able to
 
06:29:02.990 --> 06:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
go to work that you are able to take
 
06:29:04.250 --> 06:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
care of yourself
 
06:29:06.288 --> 06:29:06.298 align:start position:0%
I also want to address the black and
 
06:29:09.350 --> 06:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
white situation in terms of
 
06:29:11.150 --> 06:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
being dependent
 
06:29:15.288 --> 06:29:15.298 align:start position:0%
on government subsidies versus why don't
 
06:29:16.730 --> 06:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
the communities take care of these
 
06:29:18.650 --> 06:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
people or why don't the churches take
 
06:29:21.650 --> 06:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
care of these people and I would say I
 
06:29:23.090 --> 06:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
06:29:25.910 --> 06:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I would say that in a lot of parts of
 
06:29:27.890 --> 06:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
the state churches are doing just that
 
06:29:30.948 --> 06:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
for immigrant populations and in Keene
 
06:29:32.810 --> 06:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
where I live where there's a an
 
06:29:35.208 --> 06:29:35.218 align:start position:0%
organization called project home that
 
06:29:37.788 --> 06:29:37.798 align:start position:0%
takes in Asylum Seekers
 
06:29:37.798 --> 06:29:38.390 align:start position:0%
takes in Asylum Seekers
um

06:29:38.390 --> 06:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:40.610 --> 06:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
that is not specifically through the
 
06:29:42.430 --> 06:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
church but it's through the community
 
06:29:45.410 --> 06:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
and P and these organ this organization
 
06:29:48.230 --> 06:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
has raised thousands and thousands of
 
06:29:48.240 --> 06:29:49.430 align:start position:0%
has raised thousands and thousands of
dollars

06:29:49.430 --> 06:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:29:51.170 --> 06:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
um through the generosity of people in
 
06:29:52.788 --> 06:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
our community
 
06:29:56.270 --> 06:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
um to sponsor people in their homes
 
06:29:58.070 --> 06:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
people have taken people into their
 
06:30:00.230 --> 06:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
homes they've used the money that
 
06:30:02.208 --> 06:30:02.218 align:start position:0%
they've raised to help them with legal
 
06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
assistance with medical assistance with
 
06:30:07.368 --> 06:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
clothes for kids so they can go to
 
06:30:10.010 --> 06:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
school so I wouldn't assume that just
 
06:30:11.448 --> 06:30:11.458 align:start position:0%
because someone is now going to be
 
06:30:13.670 --> 06:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid that the community
 
06:30:19.250 --> 06:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:23.270 --> 06:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:26.110 --> 06:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
I just want to make one small
 
06:30:31.250 --> 06:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
point to representative Nagel's inquiry
 
06:30:31.260 --> 06:30:32.390 align:start position:0%
point to representative Nagel's inquiry
um

06:30:32.390 --> 06:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:34.020 --> 06:30:34.030 align:start position:0%
if somebody goes to the hospital
 
06:30:34.030 --> 06:30:35.390 align:start position:0%
if somebody goes to the hospital
[Music]

06:30:35.390 --> 06:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:30:38.030 --> 06:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
if if they have Medicaid it's paid for
 
06:30:39.770 --> 06:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
the by the government but if they have
 
06:30:41.868 --> 06:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
Medicaid they might have gone to a
 
06:30:44.030 --> 06:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
primary care provider before they needed
 
06:30:45.850 --> 06:30:45.860 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
06:30:48.170 --> 06:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing
 
06:30:50.810 --> 06:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh secondly if they go to the hospital
 
06:30:52.970 --> 06:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
and it's completely uncovered then it's
 
06:30:55.610 --> 06:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care and there's a
 
06:30:57.470 --> 06:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
complicated system of reimbursement
 
06:30:59.170 --> 06:30:59.180 align:start position:0%
which also
 
06:31:03.410 --> 06:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
deals in tax dollars so it's not
 
06:31:06.890 --> 06:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
again it's not black and white but the
 
06:31:09.590 --> 06:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
final thing is that if they don't have
 
06:31:11.270 --> 06:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
some kind of coverage there are people
 
06:31:13.610 --> 06:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
who will not seek care at all
 
06:31:15.708 --> 06:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
and that's a tragedy and it's
 
06:31:18.048 --> 06:31:18.058 align:start position:0%
particularly a tragedy because all we're
 
06:31:19.750 --> 06:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
06:31:23.930 --> 06:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
is pregnant women and small children and
 
06:31:26.208 --> 06:31:26.218 align:start position:0%
I think we owe they don't have a right
 
06:31:29.810 --> 06:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
to work the children don't the mothers
 
06:31:32.030 --> 06:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
may but they may not be able to
 
06:31:34.910 --> 06:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about kids here and we
 
06:31:38.208 --> 06:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
know that every dollar that we spend
 
06:31:41.270 --> 06:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
on giving a kid a good start in life
 
06:31:41.280 --> 06:31:43.850 align:start position:0%
on giving a kid a good start in life
returns

06:31:43.850 --> 06:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
returns
 
06:31:47.270 --> 06:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
ten later tenfold going on in terms of
 
06:31:48.530 --> 06:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
care that we don't have to give them
 
06:31:51.590 --> 06:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
later on so for that reason I will be
 
06:31:54.170 --> 06:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
voting for the bill
 
06:31:56.330 --> 06:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
06:31:58.910 --> 06:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:32:00.530 --> 06:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
inviting me to comment uh representative
 
06:32:03.288 --> 06:32:03.298 align:start position:0%
Nagel uh and you're exactly right as you
 
06:32:05.390 --> 06:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
know and I know and I I think Paula
 
06:32:06.890 --> 06:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
minnahan's from the hospital Society
 
06:32:09.708 --> 06:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned this today is that a patient
 
06:32:12.530 --> 06:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
that comes to the hospital uh will be
 
06:32:14.270 --> 06:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
taken care of regardless of ability to
 
06:32:16.250 --> 06:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
pay that's that's a no-brainer that's
 
06:32:18.110 --> 06:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
always that's always been my experience
 
06:32:20.510 --> 06:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what the hospitals in the
 
06:32:23.330 --> 06:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
state do the problem with that is that
 
06:32:25.128 --> 06:32:25.138 align:start position:0%
they go to the hospital usually because
 
06:32:26.810 --> 06:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
of an emergency or some more acute
 
06:32:29.810 --> 06:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
injury and as representative Weber said
 
06:32:31.788 --> 06:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
you know this would also help to support
 
06:32:34.850 --> 06:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
them in a preventative manner
 
06:32:37.430 --> 06:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
um so I I yes you're right it regardless
 
06:32:39.650 --> 06:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
of who's going to cover the bill whether
 
06:32:42.410 --> 06:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's you know a church a local
 
06:32:45.770 --> 06:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
organization philanthropy or Medicaid
 
06:32:47.208 --> 06:32:47.218 align:start position:0%
um we're going to take care of them but
 
06:32:48.650 --> 06:32:48.660 align:start position:0%
it would be much better to take care of
 
06:32:51.048 --> 06:32:51.058 align:start position:0%
them early on rather than an acute
 
06:32:53.930 --> 06:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
situation and lastly
 
06:32:56.690 --> 06:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's important to recognize
 
06:32:58.670 --> 06:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
though this is the business part of
 
06:33:00.650 --> 06:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
medicine I always I'll always love the
 
06:33:02.690 --> 06:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
professional side of medicine but the
 
06:33:06.170 --> 06:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
business side does exist and without if
 
06:33:08.868 --> 06:33:08.878 align:start position:0%
they have Medicaid for insurance
 
06:33:11.448 --> 06:33:11.458 align:start position:0%
I hate to hear the the statement over
 
06:33:13.670 --> 06:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
and over again the hospitals will eat it
 
06:33:16.128 --> 06:33:16.138 align:start position:0%
you know that is a problem for not only
 
06:33:17.868 --> 06:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
the hospitals maintaining their
 
06:33:19.970 --> 06:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
viability but for the communities in
 
06:33:21.770 --> 06:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
which they serve there have been a
 
06:33:23.270 --> 06:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
number of hospitals in this state that
 
06:33:24.770 --> 06:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
have actually shut down because of
 
06:33:26.690 --> 06:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
finances if you look at the critical
 
06:33:28.190 --> 06:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
access hospitals in the state there
 
06:33:31.310 --> 06:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
which there are a number 16 maybe of the
 
06:33:33.288 --> 06:33:33.298 align:start position:0%
16 if you were to check in their balance
 
06:33:35.270 --> 06:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
sheet and their budgets every year at
 
06:33:38.030 --> 06:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
least a dozen of them are in the red we
 
06:33:39.350 --> 06:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
used to always say if we didn't have a
 
06:33:41.208 --> 06:33:41.218 align:start position:0%
bottom bottom line meaning philanthropy
 
06:33:43.070 --> 06:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
we were in the red it was only the
 
06:33:45.350 --> 06:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
bottom bottom line that supported us so
 
06:33:47.810 --> 06:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
this is this this is more far-reaching
 
06:33:49.190 --> 06:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
than just simply taking care of the
 
06:33:51.770 --> 06:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
patient and the mother it it helps our
 
06:33:53.590 --> 06:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
whole community and our state thank you
 
06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King
 
06:33:57.530 --> 06:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman
 
06:33:58.788 --> 06:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to make just three quick
 
06:34:00.948 --> 06:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
points one to address representative
 
06:34:03.410 --> 06:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
Bill King and that is there's nothing
 
06:34:04.970 --> 06:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
more permanent than a temporary
 
06:34:07.548 --> 06:34:07.558 align:start position:0%
government program had there been some
 
06:34:09.530 --> 06:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
sort of clause in here that said this
 
06:34:12.048 --> 06:34:12.058 align:start position:0%
expired in three years then I think
 
06:34:14.330 --> 06:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
maybe what you're saying might have more
 
06:34:16.910 --> 06:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
possibility but there is no way this has
 
06:34:18.430 --> 06:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
ever gone away
 
06:34:22.610 --> 06:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
number two I've got citizens citizens
 
06:34:24.128 --> 06:34:24.138 align:start position:0%
who were born and raised in this country
 
06:34:27.170 --> 06:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
who make just barely enough not to
 
06:34:30.170 --> 06:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
qualify for Medicaid and too little to
 
06:34:32.090 --> 06:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
actually pay for their own insurance and
 
06:34:34.128 --> 06:34:34.138 align:start position:0%
now we're going to give people who had
 
06:34:36.410 --> 06:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
don't have any blood sweater tears in
 
06:34:38.390 --> 06:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
the building of this country we're going
 
06:34:40.190 --> 06:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
to give them Medicaid that's a slap in
 
06:34:42.230 --> 06:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
the face that's borderline treason as
 
06:34:43.548 --> 06:34:43.558 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned and number three
 
06:34:46.548 --> 06:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
the elephant in the room that nobody is
 
06:34:48.288 --> 06:34:48.298 align:start position:0%
discussing is the fact that this country
 
06:34:50.868 --> 06:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
is 31 trillion dollars in debt and
 
06:34:51.890 --> 06:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that like to
 
06:34:54.350 --> 06:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
talk about systemic this or systemic
 
06:34:57.048 --> 06:34:57.058 align:start position:0%
that well let me tell you what there is
 
06:35:00.070 --> 06:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
a systemic risk to the financial
 
06:35:03.170 --> 06:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
solvency of this country and it's not a
 
06:35:04.910 --> 06:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
matter of if it's only a matter of when
 
06:35:07.310 --> 06:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
when the dollar implodes
 
06:35:09.890 --> 06:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
when all hell breaks loose there are
 
06:35:12.048 --> 06:35:12.058 align:start position:0%
going to be so many dependents on the
 
06:35:13.788 --> 06:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
system that it is going to be
 
06:35:16.430 --> 06:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
unmitigated human misery that has not
 
06:35:19.310 --> 06:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
been seen in our lifetimes so just keep
 
06:35:21.830 --> 06:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
that in mind thank you
 
06:35:24.470 --> 06:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay I think we've talked it to death um
 
06:35:26.990 --> 06:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
yes one final comment representative
 
06:35:27.000 --> 06:35:31.610 align:start position:0%
yes one final comment representative
Nagel

06:35:31.610 --> 06:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:34.368 --> 06:35:34.378 align:start position:0%
ank microphone sorry
 
06:35:38.090 --> 06:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
um the the comment is that we've been
 
06:35:40.190 --> 06:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
focusing on women but the actual bill
 
06:35:42.770 --> 06:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
says children up to age 19 which I think
 
06:35:44.390 --> 06:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
kind of gets to what you're getting at
 
06:35:47.208 --> 06:35:47.218 align:start position:0%
with what you're saying so it's not just
 
06:35:49.610 --> 06:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
women and and I think that that creates
 
06:35:51.770 --> 06:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a problem for me the
 
06:35:53.930 --> 06:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
other question I had just has to do with
 
06:35:55.910 --> 06:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion because this actually
 
06:35:58.010 --> 06:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
refers to Medicaid expansion and my
 
06:36:00.350 --> 06:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
understanding was that was a 90-10 thing
 
06:36:03.110 --> 06:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
and this is a 50 50 thing you know what
 
06:36:05.390 --> 06:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
I'm saying so um Medicaid expansions 90
 
06:36:08.150 --> 06:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
federal dollars 10 State dollars and
 
06:36:11.570 --> 06:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
this is 50 50. I I don't understand that
 
06:36:15.110 --> 06:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:19.430 --> 06:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
this this potentially could have people
 
06:36:22.128 --> 06:36:22.138 align:start position:0%
from traditional Medicaid or from
 
06:36:23.690 --> 06:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid
 
06:36:26.270 --> 06:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
um in the case of the pregnant woman it
 
06:36:28.788 --> 06:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
could be expanded medicaid so I think
 
06:36:32.030 --> 06:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers are so small they went with
 
06:36:33.708 --> 06:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
the con in the fiscal note they went
 
06:36:35.390 --> 06:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
with the conservative
 
06:36:37.990 --> 06:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
um amounts which would be the 50 50
 
06:36:42.350 --> 06:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
match so it could potentially be 90 10.
 
06:36:45.890 --> 06:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
for some people it could be
 
06:36:49.070 --> 06:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
so that would make this this state match
 
06:36:50.330 --> 06:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit less
 
06:36:52.730 --> 06:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
but I I think they it's a small number
 
06:36:54.530 --> 06:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
of people a small amount of money they
 
06:36:54.540 --> 06:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
of people a small amount of money they
just

06:36:55.910 --> 06:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:36:58.310 --> 06:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
did it that way thank you
 
06:37:01.430 --> 06:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
all right uh I'd like to move on uh
 
06:37:03.590 --> 06:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
anybody got anything really pressing to
 
06:37:06.350 --> 06:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
say at this point not uh Alaska clerk to
 
06:37:08.948 --> 06:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:12.288 --> 06:37:12.298 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass as amended on
 
06:37:15.288 --> 06:37:15.298 align:start position:0%
House Bill 282. if I'm if I remember
 
06:37:15.298 --> 06:37:17.930 align:start position:0%
House Bill 282. if I'm if I remember
correctly

06:37:17.930 --> 06:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
06:37:19.690 --> 06:37:19.700 align:start position:0%

06:39:33.110 --> 06:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
that confusing language that we had
 
06:39:34.548 --> 06:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
trying to make sense of all those
 
06:39:36.770 --> 06:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
different sections and consolidates it
 
06:39:38.570 --> 06:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
to say that a physician and then the
 
06:39:39.830 --> 06:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
other one
 
06:39:39.840 --> 06:39:40.430 align:start position:0%
other one
um

06:39:40.430 --> 06:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:43.250 --> 06:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
um an APRN is able to prescribe
 
06:39:45.530 --> 06:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
non-opioid and opioid control drugs
 
06:39:47.330 --> 06:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
classified in schedule two through four
 
06:39:49.010 --> 06:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
by means of telemedicine after
 
06:39:50.990 --> 06:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
establishing a relationship this
 
06:39:52.548 --> 06:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
includes all the safeguards that already
 
06:39:54.470 --> 06:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
were in there and the safeguards that
 
06:39:56.090 --> 06:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
are in the current federal program that
 
06:39:58.610 --> 06:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
expires on May 11th
 
06:40:01.310 --> 06:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
um this is a good path for us to be able
 
06:40:02.990 --> 06:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
to continue providing the good high
 
06:40:05.750 --> 06:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
quality services to establish patients
 
06:40:07.970 --> 06:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
and others under a good safety mechanism
 
06:40:10.430 --> 06:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
and to keep that continuity of care now
 
06:40:12.170 --> 06:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
that kovid got us over our fear of
 
06:40:14.390 --> 06:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
telemedicine so I'm hopeful that we can
 
06:40:16.128 --> 06:40:16.138 align:start position:0%
pass this and send it to the Senate so
 
06:40:18.590 --> 06:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
they can do some quick work on it
 
06:40:21.288 --> 06:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
thank you any other discussion on

after a very uh well I'd like to thank
 
06:42:04.670 --> 06:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant for all his help
 
06:42:06.530 --> 06:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
with the amendment
 
06:42:09.048 --> 06:42:09.058 align:start position:0%
um and also the committee because of
 
06:42:11.570 --> 06:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
last week's very deliberative and
 
06:42:13.970 --> 06:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
thoughtful process
 
06:42:17.150 --> 06:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
um trying to discern exactly how this
 
06:42:19.548 --> 06:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
bill should be uh proposed
 
06:42:21.230 --> 06:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
um I think what we have come up with is
 
06:42:23.810 --> 06:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
a much more clear and succinct bill
 
06:42:26.090 --> 06:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
which really allows Physicians to do
 
06:42:27.830 --> 06:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
what they have done for the past two
 
06:42:30.410 --> 06:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
plus years during the emergency order uh
 
06:42:31.850 --> 06:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic which is to
 
06:42:31.860 --> 06:42:33.490 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic which is to
prescribe

06:42:33.490 --> 06:42:33.500 align:start position:0%
prescribe
 
06:42:36.128 --> 06:42:36.138 align:start position:0%
controlled drugs scheduled two to four
 
06:42:38.868 --> 06:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh via Telehealth
 
06:42:40.430 --> 06:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
um they've been doing this for the past
 
06:42:41.570 --> 06:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
two years they've been doing this
 
06:42:43.610 --> 06:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
successfully and would venture to say
 
06:42:45.948 --> 06:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
that the satisfaction for patients
 
06:42:48.288 --> 06:42:48.298 align:start position:0%
providers and families as importantly
 
06:42:51.470 --> 06:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
has been equal to if not better than in
 
06:42:53.868 --> 06:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
person primarily because the people that
 
06:42:55.310 --> 06:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
are dealing with this mostly are those
 
06:42:58.628 --> 06:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
that are involved in palliative care
 
06:43:01.570 --> 06:43:01.580 align:start position:0%
post-surgical patients with their pain
 
06:43:03.730 --> 06:43:03.740 align:start position:0%
levels change
 
06:43:06.948 --> 06:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
young adolescents with ADHD that need
 
06:43:09.110 --> 06:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
medication that don't have to get out of
 
06:43:11.090 --> 06:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
school or their parents don't have to
 
06:43:13.730 --> 06:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
take off a day of work so I'm very
 
06:43:15.708 --> 06:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
thankful for the committee for actually
 
06:43:17.270 --> 06:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
coming up with some very thoughtful
 
06:43:19.730 --> 06:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
comments we got rid of the clunky
 
06:43:23.030 --> 06:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
exception to the exception we now have a
 
06:43:24.470 --> 06:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill which I think is much more clear
 
06:43:28.310 --> 06:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
succinct and is truly a very strong
 
06:43:31.930 --> 06:43:31.940 align:start position:0%
patient advocacy bill this is really
 
06:43:34.070 --> 06:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
basically what I think of as a normal
 
06:43:36.530 --> 06:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
evolution of the continual Improvement
 
06:43:39.350 --> 06:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
in medical care for patients Telehealth
 
06:43:41.810 --> 06:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
is here to stay this is part of it and
 
06:43:44.510 --> 06:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
this just adds to the um the ability of
 
06:43:46.610 --> 06:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
providers to take care of patients in
 
06:43:48.530 --> 06:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
some very difficult circumstances so
 
06:43:50.868 --> 06:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak to it
 
06:43:55.010 --> 06:43:55.020 align:start position:0%

oh by the way that was our last early
 
06:45:38.690 --> 06:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
bill so we really
 
06:45:43.310 --> 06:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
we passed the Milestone today Mr chair
 
06:45:45.410 --> 06:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
what's that what's that sorry on the
 
06:45:47.090 --> 06:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
early bills things we voted on so far
 
06:45:48.650 --> 06:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
Windows have to be submitted to the
 
06:45:48.660 --> 06:45:50.448 align:start position:0%
Windows have to be submitted to the
clerk

06:45:50.448 --> 06:45:50.458 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
06:45:53.390 --> 06:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
um what's the process I believe we're
 
06:45:55.010 --> 06:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
supposed to get our reports in for that
 
06:45:57.230 --> 06:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
tonight which I know will probably be in
 
06:45:59.930 --> 06:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
the early morning on Lindsay's desk
 
06:46:02.750 --> 06:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so before our coffee please the
 
06:46:04.730 --> 06:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
deadline is usually noon on Wednesday
 
06:46:07.310 --> 06:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
and that ship has sailed but it needs to
 
06:46:09.350 --> 06:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
go in the next calendar so it's got to
 
06:46:12.590 --> 06:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
be in as soon as possible and I will
 
06:46:14.750 --> 06:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
remind people of the days
 
06:46:16.910 --> 06:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
because I've been around long enough and
 
06:46:18.890 --> 06:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative McKay will join you where
 
06:46:20.930 --> 06:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
you didn't leave the room before your
 
06:46:23.628 --> 06:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
report was submitted so who do I submit
 
06:46:25.310 --> 06:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
oh sorry who does representative Murphy
 
06:46:27.410 --> 06:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
Smith the report to if you send it to me
 
06:46:29.330 --> 06:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll quickly review it and I will
 
06:46:31.190 --> 06:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
send it over that's what I've been doing
 
06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
with all of them okay my guess is
 
06:46:34.788 --> 06:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
they're holding the calendar for the
 
06:46:37.548 --> 06:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
early bills which need to be done so I
 
06:46:39.770 --> 06:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
think the debt drop deadline drop dead
 
06:46:42.610 --> 06:46:42.620 align:start position:0%
deadline is tomorrow at noon yeah thanks
 
06:46:45.830 --> 06:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
and we also might as well submit all the
 
06:46:47.628 --> 06:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
other ones that we can too because we
 
06:46:48.830 --> 06:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
may be able to get those into this
 
06:46:51.048 --> 06:46:51.058 align:start position:0%
calendar as well
 
06:46:52.548 --> 06:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to be sleeping in the house
 
06:46:54.410 --> 06:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
next week we might as well make the most
 
06:46:57.110 --> 06:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the most of them
 
06:47:01.610 --> 06:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
okay I'm moving on to House Bill 188 uh
 
06:47:03.170 --> 06:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I believe you have
 
06:47:08.690 --> 06:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:11.270 --> 06:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
is there a second representative Weber
 
06:47:11.280 --> 06:47:12.410 align:start position:0%
is there a second representative Weber
seconds

06:47:12.410 --> 06:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
06:47:13.910 --> 06:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel do you want to
 
06:47:15.708 --> 06:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
06:47:15.718 --> 06:47:19.490 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
yes

06:47:19.490 --> 06:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:19.500 --> 06:47:20.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:47:20.270 --> 06:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:22.730 --> 06:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
yes I I work with physical therapists
 
06:47:24.708 --> 06:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
for a very long period of time um
 
06:47:26.570 --> 06:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
physical therapists are now required to
 
06:47:28.430 --> 06:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
have a doctorate
 
06:47:29.868 --> 06:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
um to practice the state of New
 
06:47:31.610 --> 06:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire podiatrists are required to
 
06:47:33.708 --> 06:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
have a doctorate chiropractors are
 
06:47:34.868 --> 06:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
required to have a doctorate
 
06:47:37.128 --> 06:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist naturopaths all those
 
06:47:38.750 --> 06:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
people can perform their services
 
06:47:40.788 --> 06:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
without a physician's prescription at
 
06:47:40.798 --> 06:47:42.170 align:start position:0%
without a physician's prescription at
all

06:47:42.170 --> 06:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:47:44.150 --> 06:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
um I brought up during the testimony
 
06:47:46.730 --> 06:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the best physical
 
06:47:48.890 --> 06:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
therapists in the world they come from
 
06:47:51.890 --> 06:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
Australia and in Australia what's unique
 
06:47:53.810 --> 06:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
there is they can practice independently
 
06:47:56.270 --> 06:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
which allows them a sense of creativity
 
06:47:58.128 --> 06:47:58.138 align:start position:0%
and I've had the honor of serving with a
 
06:48:00.770 --> 06:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
couple of Australian PTs in the work
 
06:48:02.448 --> 06:48:02.458 align:start position:0%
that I do and I really think that the
 
06:48:04.968 --> 06:48:04.978 align:start position:0%
pts here is a starting this is a
 
06:48:06.410 --> 06:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
starting point for what I hope will
 
06:48:08.810 --> 06:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
become more freedom and their ability to
 
06:48:11.270 --> 06:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
do things um with a doctorate they have
 
06:48:13.010 --> 06:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
the ability to practice what they know
 
06:48:15.650 --> 06:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
how to do to one to ask for help when
 
06:48:17.090 --> 06:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
they know to ask for help and I think
 
06:48:19.788 --> 06:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
this is a small step forward
 
06:48:23.510 --> 06:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:26.330 --> 06:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
seeing no other discussion I'll ask her
 
06:48:30.048 --> 06:48:30.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:33.048 --> 06:48:33.058 align:start position:0%

06:49:13.208 --> 06:49:13.218 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant yes

representative Murphy

representative Murphy
yes

06:49:17.690 --> 06:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:49:20.628 --> 06:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
is that Palmer yes
 
06:49:23.030 --> 06:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative long yes
 
06:49:26.090 --> 06:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
and representative McDonald yes
 
06:49:28.010 --> 06:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
money to zero
 
06:49:28.020 --> 06:49:29.090 align:start position:0%
money to zero
okay

06:49:29.090 --> 06:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:49:34.510 --> 06:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:35.600 --> 06:49:35.610 align:start position:0%
no no
 
06:49:35.610 --> 06:49:38.590 align:start position:0%
no no
[Laughter]

06:49:38.590 --> 06:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:49:40.968 --> 06:49:40.978 align:start position:0%
you're the only person who has to write
 
06:49:43.128 --> 06:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
something but this one could be a really
 
06:49:47.690 --> 06:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
very quick one uh in that all you have
 
06:49:50.270 --> 06:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
to say is that currently
 
06:49:53.150 --> 06:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
this is what they do and then
 
06:49:55.310 --> 06:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
because of the advanced degrees and
 
06:49:57.048 --> 06:49:57.058 align:start position:0%
everything else we think that this is an
 
06:49:58.610 --> 06:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
artificial distinction that should be
 
06:50:00.650 --> 06:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
removed I appreciate it when somebody
 
06:50:02.390 --> 06:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
writes something really detailed but at
 
06:50:03.968 --> 06:50:03.978 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
06:50:06.010 --> 06:50:06.020 align:start position:0%
three lines
 
06:50:09.590 --> 06:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
is good on the calendar I think mine was
 
06:50:12.890 --> 06:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
the second longest One Last Time most
 
06:50:14.868 --> 06:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
committee reports are not nearly that
 
06:50:16.368 --> 06:50:16.378 align:start position:0%
long so as you've probably already
 
06:50:18.948 --> 06:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
noticed so while I appreciate detail
 
06:50:22.430 --> 06:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's not as critical as you might
 
06:50:25.670 --> 06:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay moving on uh next up is uh House
 
06:50:28.490 --> 06:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 554 and I believe representative
 
06:50:35.590 --> 06:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:38.868 --> 06:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
554 oh yes
 
06:50:41.750 --> 06:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
along with my recommendation is to
 
06:50:44.570 --> 06:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
retain the bill and my rationale to it
 
06:50:46.128 --> 06:50:46.138 align:start position:0%
is we actually have three bills coming
 
06:50:48.530 --> 06:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
together sort of at the same time
 
06:50:50.930 --> 06:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
one was going into Commerce which was
 
06:50:53.690 --> 06:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
House Bill 303 that was supported by
 
06:50:55.490 --> 06:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel the other one was
 
06:50:58.430 --> 06:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
also 554 which is represented longrin
 
06:51:00.650 --> 06:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
they both have the same objective
 
06:51:01.968 --> 06:51:01.978 align:start position:0%
they're trying to figure out how to help
 
06:51:01.978 --> 06:51:03.590 align:start position:0%
they're trying to figure out how to help
patients

06:51:03.590 --> 06:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
patients
 
06:51:06.170 --> 06:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
obtain if you will non-opiate therapy
 
06:51:09.170 --> 06:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
not alternates if you will
 
06:51:11.448 --> 06:51:11.458 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 66 hopefully we'll talk
 
06:51:14.990 --> 06:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
about later is to create a committee the
 
06:51:17.150 --> 06:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
study committee to explore both of those
 
06:51:20.030 --> 06:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
bills and try to find a way to
 
06:51:21.730 --> 06:51:21.740 align:start position:0%
work with the stakeholder Community
 
06:51:24.530 --> 06:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
draft language
 
06:51:26.270 --> 06:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
maybe take both of those bills weave
 
06:51:28.010 --> 06:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
them together into one bill
 
06:51:30.670 --> 06:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
to make them both workable and
 
06:51:33.468 --> 06:51:33.478 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the patients
 
06:51:36.548 --> 06:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
thank you motion's been made in second
 
06:51:39.530 --> 06:51:39.540 align:start position:0%

06:51:39.540 --> 06:51:41.150 align:start position:0%
representative Leon seconds any other

06:51:41.150 --> 06:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:51:44.270 --> 06:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
yes please oh yes representative Nagel
 
06:51:45.830 --> 06:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
um just to give a little history behind
 
06:51:47.930 --> 06:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
this bill it was actually originally
 
06:51:49.788 --> 06:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
submitted by
 
06:51:52.070 --> 06:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
um representative mangaputi about three
 
06:51:53.810 --> 06:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
06:51:56.270 --> 06:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
um it has some significant issues that I
 
06:51:57.770 --> 06:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to go into any detail on
 
06:51:59.448 --> 06:51:59.458 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:51:59.458 --> 06:52:00.170 align:start position:0%
right now
um

06:52:00.170 --> 06:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:02.150 --> 06:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and what she and I talked about it at
 
06:52:03.890 --> 06:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
length and we both agreed to sit down
 
06:52:05.990 --> 06:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
and study it which we kind of did then
 
06:52:08.090 --> 06:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
the the bill kind of took on a life of
 
06:52:09.590 --> 06:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
its own
 
06:52:11.628 --> 06:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
um if you want I can talk about the
 
06:52:13.430 --> 06:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
flaws but I think that's why okay I
 
06:52:13.440 --> 06:52:14.390 align:start position:0%
flaws but I think that's why okay I
won't

06:52:14.390 --> 06:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
won't
 
06:52:17.270 --> 06:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
um the other little Minor Detail is 303
 
06:52:19.610 --> 06:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
which represent a merchant referred to
 
06:52:21.468 --> 06:52:21.478 align:start position:0%
as in the bill and it really was never
 
06:52:23.390 --> 06:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to be part of a bill that's a
 
06:52:25.548 --> 06:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
Commerce bill so the bill needs work but
 
06:52:28.250 --> 06:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
it has a lot of value and um that's why
 
06:52:31.128 --> 06:52:31.138 align:start position:0%
I think it should be retained right any
 
06:52:33.650 --> 06:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
06:52:35.690 --> 06:52:35.700 align:start position:0%

um it it was passed out I believe at the
 
06:54:06.230 --> 06:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
initial hearing because it stapled in
 
06:54:07.610 --> 06:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
together but this is the same thing
 
06:54:09.288 --> 06:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
coming around again
 
06:54:09.298 --> 06:54:27.350 align:start position:0%

I'm going to remove the original
 
06:54:33.708 --> 06:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
proposal I will um propose to um to pass

the amendment to house bill 66. and you
 
06:54:42.368 --> 06:54:42.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:45.410 --> 06:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
2023-0435h okay so you were moving out
 
06:54:47.570 --> 06:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
to pass on that Amendment correct second
 
06:54:49.670 --> 06:54:49.680 align:start position:0%

06:54:51.530 --> 06:54:51.540 align:start position:0%

representative Nagel do you want to
 
06:54:54.350 --> 06:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment
 
06:54:56.690 --> 06:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
um yes the the primary change that we
 
06:54:58.548 --> 06:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
made was the original
 
06:55:00.590 --> 06:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
um Bill asked to create a commission
 
06:55:02.868 --> 06:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
which we thought was excessive that we
 
06:55:04.250 --> 06:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
feel that we can do the work that we
 
06:55:06.530 --> 06:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
need to do in a committee
 
06:55:09.830 --> 06:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
um that's basically it and and
 
06:55:11.570 --> 06:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant already pretty
 
06:55:13.610 --> 06:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
much addressed the virtues of this bill
 
06:55:13.620 --> 06:55:15.830 align:start position:0%
much addressed the virtues of this bill
previously

06:55:15.830 --> 06:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
previously
 
06:55:22.548 --> 06:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:24.590 --> 06:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will ask Clark to call the
 
06:55:24.600 --> 06:55:27.048 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will ask Clark to call the
roll

06:55:27.048 --> 06:55:27.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:29.208 --> 06:55:29.218 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you so is the
 
06:55:31.850 --> 06:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
only change
 
06:55:33.468 --> 06:55:33.478 align:start position:0%
making it a committee instead of a
 
06:55:33.478 --> 06:55:34.610 align:start position:0%
making it a committee instead of a
commission

06:55:34.610 --> 06:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:55:36.110 --> 06:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
is that the only change or anything a
 
06:55:38.030 --> 06:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
committee instead of a commission
 
06:55:41.270 --> 06:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
it does change it from a commission to a
 
06:55:42.830 --> 06:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
committee but in the commission when we
 
06:55:44.150 --> 06:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
created the commission there was also
 
06:55:46.070 --> 06:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that were listed in the
 
06:55:48.590 --> 06:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
commission those have been
 
06:55:48.600 --> 06:55:50.530 align:start position:0%
commission those have been
um

06:55:50.530 --> 06:55:50.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:53.628 --> 06:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
have been eliminated so the intent of it
 
06:55:55.010 --> 06:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
was what
 
06:55:56.570 --> 06:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
the intent of it is to have the
 
06:55:58.430 --> 06:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholder Community pull all of mint
 
06:56:02.208 --> 06:56:02.218 align:start position:0%
all of them together and not try to be
 
06:56:03.948 --> 06:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
prescriptive about which stakeholder
 
06:56:06.288 --> 06:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
Community should be part of it but the
 
06:56:07.730 --> 06:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
goal here is to be sure we're as
 
06:56:09.350 --> 06:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
inclusive with stakeholder Community as
 
06:56:09.360 --> 06:56:10.910 align:start position:0%
inclusive with stakeholder Community as
possible

06:56:10.910 --> 06:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
possible
 
06:56:12.708 --> 06:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber and I was
 
06:56:15.230 --> 06:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
just going to emphasize that despite the
 
06:56:17.990 --> 06:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
removal of the specifics are the intent
 
06:56:20.930 --> 06:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
is to make it more inclusive rather than
 
06:56:23.030 --> 06:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
less and less dependent on who was doing
 
06:56:24.770 --> 06:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
the appointing which was one of the
 
06:56:27.468 --> 06:56:27.478 align:start position:0%
concerns expressed at the at the first
 
06:56:29.750 --> 06:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
hearing so that the people who are
 
06:56:32.628 --> 06:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
interested can come and and be heard

okay without objection we'll put that on
 
06:59:25.490 --> 06:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar
 
06:59:29.208 --> 06:59:29.218 align:start position:0%
moving on House Bill 325 all right say
 
06:59:32.510 --> 06:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
one thing I just developed a dystonia in
 
06:59:34.010 --> 06:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
my right hand I don't think I can write
 
06:59:36.048 --> 06:59:36.058 align:start position:0%
that but representative Merchant can do
 
06:59:42.948 --> 06:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:45.410 --> 06:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
moving on speaking of Representative
 
06:59:46.968 --> 06:59:46.978 align:start position:0%
merchant do you have a motion on House
 
06:59:56.468 --> 06:59:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:56.478 --> 06:59:58.690 align:start position:0%
 
yes

yes
 
07:00:01.250 --> 07:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
I think there's an amendment to that
 
07:00:03.048 --> 07:00:03.058 align:start position:0%
with the past first
 
07:00:03.058 --> 07:00:04.670 align:start position:0%

okay
 
07:00:07.070 --> 07:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
indeed you have a copy of the amendment
 
07:00:08.628 --> 07:00:08.638 align:start position:0%

it's o431h if you don't have copies I
can

07:00:16.670 --> 07:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
07:00:18.770 --> 07:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
get those to the uh
 
07:00:20.510 --> 07:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
research assistance maybe she could help
 
07:00:22.610 --> 07:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
me make some copies
 
07:00:24.110 --> 07:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was trying to keep up with
 
07:00:26.510 --> 07:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
all of this on House Bill 66 were you
 
07:00:28.190 --> 07:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
writing that report or would you like me
 
07:00:29.628 --> 07:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
to do that to help everybody else's
 
07:00:32.330 --> 07:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
typing fingers okay and did we move
 
07:00:34.610 --> 07:00:34.620 align:start position:0%
consent on that one yes okay perfect
 
07:00:38.150 --> 07:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so can you do folks have a
 
07:00:41.270 --> 07:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment 0-4
 
07:00:54.610 --> 07:00:54.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:01.548 --> 07:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:01.558 --> 07:01:08.650 align:start position:0%
 
um yes

07:01:08.650 --> 07:01:08.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:20.208 --> 07:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:22.730 --> 07:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
representative Weber in the interest of
 
07:01:24.468 --> 07:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
time uh we're going to get copies of
 
07:01:26.628 --> 07:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
that Amendment without parliamentarian
 
07:01:28.430 --> 07:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
would we have to withdraw the motion and
 
07:01:30.468 --> 07:01:30.478 align:start position:0%
second on that Amendment if we want to
 
07:01:36.968 --> 07:01:36.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:41.030 --> 07:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay all right that was quick
 
07:01:44.990 --> 07:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
all right uh let's proceed then
 
07:01:45.000 --> 07:01:52.310 align:start position:0%
all right uh let's proceed then
okay

07:01:52.310 --> 07:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:01.628 --> 07:02:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:04.490 --> 07:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
well I thought we were going to do six
 
07:02:06.410 --> 07:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
eleven six eleven yes yes we'll do six
 
07:02:08.750 --> 07:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
eleven I I are there any amendments on
 
07:02:08.760 --> 07:02:10.090 align:start position:0%
eleven I I are there any amendments on
611

07:02:10.090 --> 07:02:10.100 align:start position:0%
611
 
07:02:12.170 --> 07:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
before we do anything
 
07:02:14.448 --> 07:02:14.458 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think so so let's uh
 
07:02:18.048 --> 07:02:18.058 align:start position:0%
proceed to 611. uh representative Leon
 
07:02:20.090 --> 07:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
um I move ought to pass on House Bill
 
07:02:20.100 --> 07:02:22.310 align:start position:0%
um I move ought to pass on House Bill
611.

07:02:22.310 --> 07:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
611.
 
07:02:23.868 --> 07:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
okay representative Weber seconds
 
07:02:25.490 --> 07:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative Leon do you want to speak
 
07:02:28.670 --> 07:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
to your motion yes thank you Mr chairman
 
07:02:31.250 --> 07:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
um what this bill does is it removes
 
07:02:33.230 --> 07:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
what essentially is a mandate that
 
07:02:35.810 --> 07:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
people try opioids and irreversible
 
07:02:37.968 --> 07:02:37.978 align:start position:0%
surgeries before having access to
 
07:02:40.850 --> 07:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis for severe pain I
 
07:02:41.810 --> 07:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
don't think that that was ever the
 
07:02:43.490 --> 07:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
intention When It Was Written but it
 
07:02:46.490 --> 07:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
ended up being that the impact the the
 
07:02:49.250 --> 07:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
reality so this is just a way to clear
 
07:02:51.770 --> 07:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
up this bill and allow cannabis before
 
07:02:54.708 --> 07:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis before opioids or
 
07:02:57.468 --> 07:02:57.478 align:start position:0%
spinal fusion or any other
 
07:02:59.810 --> 07:02:59.820 align:start position:0%
exhausting all other possibilities so I
 
07:03:00.948 --> 07:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
think that this is something that's
 
07:03:02.570 --> 07:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
quite common sense and that hopefully we
 
07:03:05.208 --> 07:03:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:06.948 --> 07:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
another discussion representative Weber
 
07:03:09.530 --> 07:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that from an
 
07:03:12.350 --> 07:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
historic perspective we're seeing this
 
07:03:14.628 --> 07:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
with several bills that we will exec
 
07:03:16.390 --> 07:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
either today or shortly
 
07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
in that the price of getting a governor
 
07:03:23.930 --> 07:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
to sign a bill and there were Governors
 
07:03:25.610 --> 07:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the aisle who were
 
07:03:28.788 --> 07:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
involved in this was to put fairly
 
07:03:32.628 --> 07:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
strict restrictions on the program and
 
07:03:34.490 --> 07:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
that was how we got the program passed
 
07:03:36.830 --> 07:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
to begin with now that we have a
 
07:03:39.128 --> 07:03:39.138 align:start position:0%
significant amount of
 
07:03:43.250 --> 07:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
experience with the program we know or
 
07:03:44.990 --> 07:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
at least I believe and I think everybody
 
07:03:47.510 --> 07:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
here believes that expanding the program
 
07:03:50.030 --> 07:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
rather than keeping the guard rails is
 
07:03:53.090 --> 07:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
where we need to go so that was the
 
07:03:55.250 --> 07:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
historic reason for some of these
 
07:03:59.570 --> 07:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
restrictions that don't seem in 2020
 
07:04:02.270 --> 07:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
hindsight to make a great deal of sense
 
07:04:04.128 --> 07:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:04:06.590 --> 07:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
07:04:08.570 --> 07:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
um representative Nagel we have three
 
07:04:10.730 --> 07:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
cannabis bills coming up and I'm going
 
07:04:12.650 --> 07:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
to probably vote for at least two out of
 
07:04:14.810 --> 07:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
the three somewhat under protest
 
07:04:17.930 --> 07:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
um I have a really and I I don't know if
 
07:04:19.670 --> 07:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is the right time to bring up the
 
07:04:21.890 --> 07:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
concerns that I raised is this the right
 
07:04:24.230 --> 07:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
time yeah not only on this bill though
 
07:04:27.590 --> 07:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's on it's on this bill
 
07:04:29.628 --> 07:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
um I've been practicing pain management
 
07:04:32.270 --> 07:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years I've been advocating
 
07:04:34.190 --> 07:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
for the rights of people to have access
 
07:04:36.070 --> 07:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
to a broad range of therapeutic
 
07:04:39.770 --> 07:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
modalities for third over 30 years I
 
07:04:42.048 --> 07:04:42.058 align:start position:0%
wrote the opioid prescribing rules 30
 
07:04:44.330 --> 07:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
years ago and the primary reason why was
 
07:04:47.030 --> 07:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
I was seeing people in intractable pain
 
07:04:50.570 --> 07:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
that had failed everything Chiropractic
 
07:04:53.030 --> 07:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
Care Veterinarian care better yeah
 
07:04:54.650 --> 07:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
whatever I'll go down the list it
 
07:04:57.230 --> 07:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter I mean and and and they
 
07:05:00.410 --> 07:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
were severely disabled by their pain and
 
07:05:03.110 --> 07:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
and I was told by a society that if I
 
07:05:05.208 --> 07:05:05.218 align:start position:0%
prescribe long-term opioid therapy for
 
07:05:06.770 --> 07:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
them that I could end up in jail for
 
07:05:09.288 --> 07:05:09.298 align:start position:0%
doing that in many states the United
 
07:05:11.150 --> 07:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
States and that included end of life
 
07:05:14.110 --> 07:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
care we started in this discussion in
 
07:05:17.690 --> 07:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
1986 and um I was honored to actually be
 
07:05:20.570 --> 07:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
offered the Catherine Foley chair at the
 
07:05:22.250 --> 07:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
center of practical bioethics who wrote
 
07:05:25.128 --> 07:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
the paper on this subject in 1985 to
 
07:05:27.170 --> 07:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
point out that it was absolutely absurd
 
07:05:29.750 --> 07:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
to deny people the end of life access to
 
07:05:31.430 --> 07:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable medication to control their
 
07:05:33.468 --> 07:05:33.478 align:start position:0%
pain and it was really sad that it took
 
07:05:35.750 --> 07:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
that to happen
 
07:05:35.760 --> 07:05:38.208 align:start position:0%
that to happen
um

07:05:38.208 --> 07:05:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:40.968 --> 07:05:40.978 align:start position:0%
a lot of myth was was portrayed about
 
07:05:42.770 --> 07:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
opioids during the course of that
 
07:05:42.780 --> 07:05:44.090 align:start position:0%
opioids during the course of that
testimony

07:05:44.090 --> 07:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
07:05:47.090 --> 07:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
um I personally believe that I mean in
 
07:05:49.788 --> 07:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
my practice 30-year practice I have
 
07:05:52.190 --> 07:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
never ever practiced a prescribed an
 
07:05:54.850 --> 07:05:54.860 align:start position:0%
opioid to anybody
 
07:05:57.350 --> 07:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
that had not failed multiple modalities
 
07:05:59.510 --> 07:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
beforehand and I'm fully aware that in
 
07:06:01.788 --> 07:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
some instances that doesn't happen but
 
07:06:04.368 --> 07:06:04.378 align:start position:0%
when we look at the data on outcome of
 
07:06:07.310 --> 07:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
opioid therapy our belief from day one
 
07:06:10.070 --> 07:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
and we wrote this in 1987 was that
 
07:06:11.510 --> 07:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's a small percentage of people
 
07:06:13.490 --> 07:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
that can respond very well to opioid
 
07:06:15.230 --> 07:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
therapy for a long period of time for
 
07:06:16.310 --> 07:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
chronic pain
 
07:06:18.350 --> 07:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
we still to this date don't know who
 
07:06:19.490 --> 07:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
they are
 
07:06:21.350 --> 07:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
um it's done by trial and error usually
 
07:06:23.868 --> 07:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
after other things have failed the
 
07:06:25.968 --> 07:06:25.978 align:start position:0%
addiction rate is not ubiquitous as
 
07:06:29.270 --> 07:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
people try to say the the likelihood in
 
07:06:31.490 --> 07:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
this is in the CDC guidelines
 
07:06:34.070 --> 07:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and we've been saying this since 1987
 
07:06:36.170 --> 07:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
that your likelihood of becoming
 
07:06:38.150 --> 07:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
addicted to opioids for chronic
 
07:06:40.490 --> 07:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
therapies five to ten percent it's not
 
07:06:42.948 --> 07:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous when we prescribe it for
 
07:06:45.110 --> 07:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
acute care it's like one tenth of a
 
07:06:46.368 --> 07:06:46.378 align:start position:0%
percent so
 
07:06:48.288 --> 07:06:48.298 align:start position:0%
we really need to be careful that we
 
07:06:49.910 --> 07:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't blow that out of proportion with
 
07:06:52.490 --> 07:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
that said we argued way back when that
 
07:06:54.708 --> 07:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
this is an okay therapy for some people
 
07:06:56.868 --> 07:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
not everybody
 
07:06:59.330 --> 07:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
I won't go into great detail about how
 
07:07:01.610 --> 07:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
that led to an opioid crisis because I
 
07:07:03.048 --> 07:07:03.058 align:start position:0%
think it's Way Beyond the discussion
 
07:07:05.390 --> 07:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
here but what I do remember and I I go
 
07:07:06.948 --> 07:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
to lots of meetings for lots of
 
07:07:08.930 --> 07:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
therapies and whenever I go to a meeting
 
07:07:11.390 --> 07:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
everybody tells me that their therapy is
 
07:07:14.030 --> 07:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
the best and everybody else stinks what
 
07:07:16.310 --> 07:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
I've come to understand is that that's
 
07:07:18.708 --> 07:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
that nobody has got the universal
 
07:07:20.930 --> 07:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
solution for pain that everything has
 
07:07:22.730 --> 07:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
value and that we've known since the mid
 
07:07:24.650 --> 07:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
80s that integrative care works the best
 
07:07:26.750 --> 07:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
what bothered me in hearing this
 
07:07:29.628 --> 07:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
testimony was the belief that cannabis
 
07:07:31.850 --> 07:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
has the Ability Beyond its abilities
 
07:07:33.708 --> 07:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
that everything else does not have and
 
07:07:35.750 --> 07:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
we know that that's not true we know
 
07:07:37.730 --> 07:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
there's some people for Canada Cannabis
 
07:07:39.890 --> 07:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
works really well we know for some
 
07:07:42.170 --> 07:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
people it's a really rotten modality and
 
07:07:43.850 --> 07:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
we need to be very careful I don't
 
07:07:46.128 --> 07:07:46.138 align:start position:0%
personally believe it should ever be a
 
07:07:48.288 --> 07:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
first line therapy I think you should
 
07:07:50.208 --> 07:07:50.218 align:start position:0%
exhaust other things and if you look at
 
07:07:52.010 --> 07:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
my book which one of our kind members
 
07:07:53.810 --> 07:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
agreed to buy which I would have handed
 
07:07:55.610 --> 07:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
to him if he wanted but this whole
 
07:07:57.890 --> 07:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
chapter on how I think we as a society
 
07:08:00.590 --> 07:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
should use medicinal cannabis as opposed
 
07:08:03.110 --> 07:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
to recreational Cannabis with that said
 
07:08:04.730 --> 07:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
the problem that I have with this bill
 
07:08:06.708 --> 07:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
would I still will vote for it because I
 
07:08:08.868 --> 07:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
do believe that doctors and patients
 
07:08:10.490 --> 07:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
have the rights to make the decisions
 
07:08:13.190 --> 07:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
without Society telling what to do but I
 
07:08:15.410 --> 07:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
would argue vehemently to any doctor
 
07:08:17.390 --> 07:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
that if that's the first thing that you
 
07:08:19.968 --> 07:08:19.978 align:start position:0%
think about then that's a problem there
 
07:08:21.890 --> 07:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
is a problem with cannabis Addiction in
 
07:08:24.650 --> 07:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
this society that is totally
 
07:08:24.660 --> 07:08:26.530 align:start position:0%
this society that is totally
underreported

07:08:26.530 --> 07:08:26.540 align:start position:0%
underreported
 
07:08:28.910 --> 07:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis creates a whole bunch of other
 
07:08:30.650 --> 07:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
problems that we know it creates motor
 
07:08:33.048 --> 07:08:33.058 align:start position:0%
impairment it creates
 
07:08:35.990 --> 07:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
um a tendency towards schizophrenia and
 
07:08:38.448 --> 07:08:38.458 align:start position:0%
young people the nice thing in my NFL
 
07:08:42.590 --> 07:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
Pain Group we I'm blessed to have two
 
07:08:45.410 --> 07:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
experts on cannabis not just one one's
 
07:08:47.390 --> 07:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
an international expert the other one's
 
07:08:49.310 --> 07:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
actually a childhood psychiatrist and
 
07:08:51.288 --> 07:08:51.298 align:start position:0%
we've argued vehemently and we've argued
 
07:08:52.490 --> 07:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
this with the players that if you're
 
07:08:54.468 --> 07:08:54.478 align:start position:0%
under 25 and you're not neurologically
 
07:08:56.330 --> 07:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
developed this is not a good option for
 
07:08:58.690 --> 07:08:58.700 align:start position:0%
you there are some exceptions
 
07:09:01.730 --> 07:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
that's my point of view and I'm standing
 
07:09:03.288 --> 07:09:03.298 align:start position:0%
up for the rights of the people I
 
07:09:05.150 --> 07:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
represent on the New Hampshire pain
 
07:09:06.830 --> 07:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
collaborative because right now we're
 
07:09:09.350 --> 07:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
seeing thousands of people yearly all
 
07:09:10.730 --> 07:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
over the country being killed by
 
07:09:13.430 --> 07:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
indiscriminate public policies that are
 
07:09:14.990 --> 07:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
not looking at their needs and looking
 
07:09:16.788 --> 07:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
at broad-based policies they're based
 
07:09:19.010 --> 07:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
more on myth and fantasy that's all I
 
07:09:23.208 --> 07:09:23.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:25.430 --> 07:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
hearing saying none I'll ask Clark to

07:11:16.010 --> 07:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill sorry house amendment to
 
07:11:19.910 --> 07:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 325 the amendment reads zero
 
07:11:22.128 --> 07:11:22.138 align:start position:0%
four three one h
 
07:11:24.948 --> 07:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second
 
07:11:26.868 --> 07:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
I representative lay on second so
 
07:11:28.250 --> 07:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
representative merchant do you want to
 
07:11:30.170 --> 07:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
07:11:30.180 --> 07:11:33.410 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
yes

07:11:33.410 --> 07:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:34.910 --> 07:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
07:11:37.610 --> 07:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
at least I was informed and it was a
 
07:11:40.430 --> 07:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
wise informed information if you will
 
07:11:41.868 --> 07:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill was originally
 
07:11:41.878 --> 07:11:42.770 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill was originally
written

07:11:42.770 --> 07:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
written
 
07:11:44.930 --> 07:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
there is no expiration to how long you
 
07:11:46.548 --> 07:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
stay on the board after their term
 
07:11:48.650 --> 07:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
expired they could actually take it to
 
07:11:50.448 --> 07:11:50.458 align:start position:0%
the grade with them quite frankly that
 
07:11:52.670 --> 07:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
was never the intent of my bill so by
 
07:11:54.890 --> 07:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
working with some stakeholders I was
 
07:11:56.448 --> 07:11:56.458 align:start position:0%
able to come up with a reasonable
 
07:11:58.368 --> 07:11:58.378 align:start position:0%
compromise to make it six months after
 
07:12:00.350 --> 07:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
the term expires that therefore that's
 
07:12:01.968 --> 07:12:01.978 align:start position:0%
the reason for the bill for the
 
07:12:03.650 --> 07:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill
 
07:12:05.030 --> 07:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:12:07.610 --> 07:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
07:12:10.610 --> 07:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative McLean yeah thank you Mr
 
07:12:10.620 --> 07:12:11.628 align:start position:0%
representative McLean yeah thank you Mr
chair

07:12:11.628 --> 07:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
chair
 
07:12:13.368 --> 07:12:13.378 align:start position:0%
um you know having looked at the bill
 
07:12:13.378 --> 07:12:14.330 align:start position:0%
um you know having looked at the bill
again

07:12:14.330 --> 07:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
again
 
07:12:17.208 --> 07:12:17.218 align:start position:0%
um I really think that the five years
 
07:12:19.368 --> 07:12:19.378 align:start position:0%
I think gives you enough of a window to
 
07:12:20.690 --> 07:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
see that the term is going to be coming
 
07:12:22.788 --> 07:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
to an end and I don't think that there's
 
07:12:24.650 --> 07:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
any other board that makes this kind of
 
07:12:26.990 --> 07:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
provision so in this case I will be
 
07:12:29.590 --> 07:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
voting against this bill
 
07:12:32.208 --> 07:12:32.218 align:start position:0%
and against the amendment I was talking
 
07:12:33.410 --> 07:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
about the amendment right now the
 
07:12:35.390 --> 07:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
amendment yes thank you Mr chair thank
 
07:12:35.400 --> 07:12:36.288 align:start position:0%
amendment yes thank you Mr chair thank
you

07:12:36.288 --> 07:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:12:36.298 --> 07:12:37.090 align:start position:0%
you
um

07:12:37.090 --> 07:12:37.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:39.230 --> 07:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh Merchant speak there
 
07:12:42.048 --> 07:12:42.058 align:start position:0%
please I initially thought that too and
 
07:12:43.430 --> 07:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
I was on the Board of Pharmacy we
 
07:12:45.530 --> 07:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
actually had members on the board that
 
07:12:47.690 --> 07:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
term would expire and they would stay on
 
07:12:49.368 --> 07:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
the board which I don't understand how
 
07:12:51.230 --> 07:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
they did it because according to what I
 
07:12:53.390 --> 07:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
read there was no RSA to allow for it
 
07:12:54.410 --> 07:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
but they did
 
07:12:56.570 --> 07:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
and what I caught my attention is no one
 
07:12:58.368 --> 07:12:58.378 align:start position:0%
pays attention to reappointing somebody
 
07:13:01.430 --> 07:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
to a board until it's time to to do it
 
07:13:03.650 --> 07:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
and the windows up happening is a lot of
 
07:13:06.350 --> 07:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
times people get caught by off guard so
 
07:13:07.850 --> 07:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden the term comes up and
 
07:13:09.350 --> 07:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
someone goes oh
 
07:13:10.850 --> 07:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
who's going to be the next person in
 
07:13:13.010 --> 07:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
line and it's like everything else in
 
07:13:14.690 --> 07:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
life we're very busy
 
07:13:17.090 --> 07:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
we lose track of time and it's not until
 
07:13:18.468 --> 07:13:18.478 align:start position:0%
all sudden the term is going to expire
 
07:13:20.750 --> 07:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes literally on the day in which
 
07:13:21.830 --> 07:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be expired someone
 
07:13:23.030 --> 07:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
responds to it so I understand when
 
07:13:24.650 --> 07:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
you're coming from representative but
 
07:13:26.390 --> 07:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
the reality is human behavior being what
 
07:13:28.850 --> 07:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
it is people don't always look down a
 
07:13:31.070 --> 07:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
road five years out and saying we have
 
07:13:32.208 --> 07:13:32.218 align:start position:0%
to take care of the term at that point
 
07:13:34.070 --> 07:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
in time it doesn't happen until all of a
 
07:13:36.910 --> 07:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
sudden has to be taken care of
 
07:13:39.948 --> 07:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
it was to respond yes uh thank you for
 
07:13:41.090 --> 07:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
the clarification representative
 
07:13:43.190 --> 07:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
Merchant I I think though that would
 
07:13:45.048 --> 07:13:45.058 align:start position:0%
probably be the same situation for many
 
07:13:46.730 --> 07:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
boards so I think maybe a better
 
07:13:48.530 --> 07:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
approach Michael to be back and look at
 
07:13:50.930 --> 07:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
a more systemic approach than than just
 
07:13:52.368 --> 07:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
a piecemeal but I appreciate where
 
07:13:54.590 --> 07:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
you're coming from I totally agree with
 
07:13:56.810 --> 07:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately
 
07:13:56.820 --> 07:13:57.468 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately
um

07:13:57.468 --> 07:13:57.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:59.628 --> 07:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
I couldn't tackle the whole lotion I
 
07:14:02.270 --> 07:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
only could take care of the pond
 
07:14:04.190 --> 07:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
07:14:07.310 --> 07:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say that if you um
 
07:14:10.250 --> 07:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
really want it to to be a shorter term
 
07:14:11.830 --> 07:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
duration thing
 
07:14:14.448 --> 07:14:14.458 align:start position:0%
my suggestion would be to vote in favor
 
07:14:17.390 --> 07:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
of the amendment because it makes it
 
07:14:19.310 --> 07:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
considerably shorter than the original
 
07:14:22.548 --> 07:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
Bill did and then by all means vote
 
07:14:25.190 --> 07:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
against the bill when it's ought to pass
 
07:14:27.230 --> 07:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
is amended but that's just a tactical
 
07:14:29.990 --> 07:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
consideration and it's entirely for you
 
07:14:31.490 --> 07:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
point taken thank you representative
 
07:14:31.500 --> 07:14:32.628 align:start position:0%
point taken thank you representative

07:14:32.628 --> 07:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
07:14:35.090 --> 07:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
07:14:38.390 --> 07:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none I don't see any okay that's
 
07:14:40.670 --> 07:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
the book to call the wall on the
 
07:14:43.430 --> 07:14:43.440 align:start position:0%

there a second
 
07:16:03.650 --> 07:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer seconds
 
07:16:05.510 --> 07:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
any discussion representative merchant
 
07:16:07.368 --> 07:16:07.378 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to your
 
07:16:10.070 --> 07:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
to your um
 
07:16:10.080 --> 07:16:11.570 align:start position:0%
to your um
motion

07:16:11.570 --> 07:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
motion
 
07:16:15.830 --> 07:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
is calling me today thank you Mr chair
 
07:16:17.690 --> 07:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
I totally agree with comments made
 
07:16:20.150 --> 07:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
earlier about the um
 
07:16:22.490 --> 07:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
advisory Council being only one of the
 
07:16:23.990 --> 07:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
councils one of the boards if you will
 
07:16:26.390 --> 07:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill deals with the reality is
 
07:16:27.890 --> 07:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
that it would be nice if we could do
 
07:16:30.170 --> 07:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
this for all the boards uh but right now
 
07:16:31.490 --> 07:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's not an option on the table
 
07:16:34.610 --> 07:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
because it's just too much of a lift
 
07:16:36.770 --> 07:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
but also knowing human be human behavior
 
07:16:38.330 --> 07:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
being what it is
 
07:16:39.890 --> 07:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
people don't respond to things until
 
07:16:42.708 --> 07:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
deadlines approach and unfortunately
 
07:16:44.990 --> 07:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
deadlines come and go and then all of a
 
07:16:46.190 --> 07:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
sudden you have a council that doesn't
 
07:16:47.390 --> 07:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
have particularly in this particular
 
07:16:47.400 --> 07:16:48.410 align:start position:0%
have particularly in this particular
case

07:16:48.410 --> 07:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
case
 
07:16:52.070 --> 07:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's a multi-disciplinary council with
 
07:16:55.730 --> 07:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
um people from Dentistry medicine nurse
 
07:16:57.650 --> 07:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
practitioners law enforcement Attorney
 
07:16:59.930 --> 07:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
General's office and so forth when you
 
07:17:02.208 --> 07:17:02.218 align:start position:0%
lose that voice this of one particular
 
07:17:04.070 --> 07:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
member of the council that voice has
 
07:17:05.750 --> 07:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
gone for a long period of time and it
 
07:17:07.910 --> 07:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
becomes very valuable to maintain that
 
07:17:09.948 --> 07:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
we have all the stakeholders around the
 
07:17:12.048 --> 07:17:12.058 align:start position:0%
table with the council and this allows
 
07:17:13.430 --> 07:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
for that to happen it doesn't go on
 
07:17:15.410 --> 07:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
indefinitely it does allow for at least
 
07:17:17.090 --> 07:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
a period of time for people to respond
 
07:17:21.410 --> 07:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
to the last minute nature we all face
 
07:17:25.548 --> 07:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:27.890 --> 07:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
let me see no other discussion
 
07:17:30.048 --> 07:17:30.058 align:start position:0%
okay the clerk was ready I would ask him
 
07:17:31.850 --> 07:17:31.860 align:start position:0%

speak to your motion
 
07:19:12.650 --> 07:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
yes we heard during
 
07:19:15.350 --> 07:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
testimony about the importance of having
 
07:19:17.628 --> 07:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
a provider who has
 
07:19:19.788 --> 07:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
experience and knowledge in Pediatric
 
07:19:19.798 --> 07:19:20.930 align:start position:0%
experience and knowledge in Pediatric
Care

07:19:20.930 --> 07:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
Care
 
07:19:23.288 --> 07:19:23.298 align:start position:0%
we recognize at that point in time
 
07:19:26.090 --> 07:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
limiting that to a pediatrician which is
 
07:19:27.708 --> 07:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
obviously a physician who specializes in
 
07:19:29.150 --> 07:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Care
 
07:19:31.010 --> 07:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
is quite honor some patience
 
07:19:32.090 --> 07:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
particularly those in the North country
 
07:19:34.548 --> 07:19:34.558 align:start position:0%
and people in rural parts of America so
 
07:19:36.410 --> 07:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
recognizing the importance of having
 
07:19:38.330 --> 07:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
someone with knowledge in pediatric care
 
07:19:40.670 --> 07:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
we changed the wording in the amendment
 
07:19:43.430 --> 07:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
to read basically a provider who
 
07:19:45.170 --> 07:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
provides pediatric care so it could be a
 
07:19:47.390 --> 07:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner it could be a family
 
07:19:49.250 --> 07:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
practice physician it could be somebody
 
07:19:51.288 --> 07:19:51.298 align:start position:0%
who's providing pediatric care who
 
07:19:53.690 --> 07:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
therefore has knowledge in that space to
 
07:19:55.150 --> 07:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
be the second
 
07:19:57.708 --> 07:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
certifying physician or provider if you
 
07:19:59.690 --> 07:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
will who has knowledge for the for the
 
07:20:02.150 --> 07:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
miners so we're still recognizing the
 
07:20:04.548 --> 07:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
importance of having somebody with
 
07:20:08.090 --> 07:20:08.100 align:start position:0%

okay are we um Vice chairman and I had
 
07:23:20.510 --> 07:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
collaborated or consulted with the

ranking member and the given time
 
07:23:27.170 --> 07:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
constraints or experiencing today we
 
07:23:28.368 --> 07:23:28.378 align:start position:0%
know people have
 
07:23:31.070 --> 07:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
places they need to be so we decided
 
07:23:32.448 --> 07:23:32.458 align:start position:0%
that's where we would conclude the
 
07:23:36.830 --> 07:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:39.048 --> 07:23:39.058 align:start position:0%
431 I it's my understanding we're going
 
07:23:40.910 --> 07:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
to continue that
 
07:23:46.070 --> 07:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
so Bill uh the following bills 582
 
07:23:46.080 --> 07:23:48.048 align:start position:0%
so Bill uh the following bills 582
615

07:23:48.048 --> 07:23:48.058 align:start position:0%
615
 
07:23:48.058 --> 07:23:49.910 align:start position:0%
615
431

07:23:49.910 --> 07:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
431
 
07:23:49.920 --> 07:23:51.708 align:start position:0%
431
299

07:23:51.708 --> 07:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
299
 
07:23:51.718 --> 07:23:53.590 align:start position:0%
299
322

07:23:53.590 --> 07:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
322
 
07:23:56.590 --> 07:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
454 and 323
 
07:23:59.750 --> 07:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
I would continue until March 8th next
 
07:24:02.208 --> 07:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
week we have two session days that would
 
07:24:04.788 --> 07:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
conflict with us meeting
 
07:24:06.650 --> 07:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
we do have we are scheduled to meet
 
07:24:08.628 --> 07:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we have a full day of
 
07:24:08.638 --> 07:24:14.448 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we have a full day of
hearings

07:24:14.448 --> 07:24:14.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:16.430 --> 07:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
we do we are not scheduled to meet next
 
07:24:18.708 --> 07:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
week as a committee because again the
 
07:24:21.350 --> 07:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
speaker has told us likely and I assume
 
07:24:23.270 --> 07:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
it it sounds like it's a virtual
 
07:24:24.708 --> 07:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
certainty at this point that it's going
 
07:24:27.170 --> 07:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
to be a session day on Wednesday and
 
07:24:28.968 --> 07:24:28.978 align:start position:0%
also uh and it's already scheduled for
 
07:24:33.468 --> 07:24:33.478 align:start position:0%
Thursday and in both days are long days
 
07:24:37.448 --> 07:24:37.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:39.708 --> 07:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
we have a little breathing room because
 
07:24:41.510 --> 07:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
the we are now through the early bills
 
07:24:45.048 --> 07:24:45.058 align:start position:0%
and the next deadline is March 16th
 
07:24:47.030 --> 07:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:24:48.410 --> 07:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will see you tomorrow
