00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 align:start position:0%
here or maybe that wasn't you I don't
 
00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.670 align:start position:0%
here or maybe that wasn't you I don't
know

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
sbbc operating budget okay here we
 
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.150 align:start position:0%
sbbc operating budget okay here we
go

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 align:start position:0%
um maybe we so what do we have we have
 
00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.949 align:start position:0%
um maybe we so what do we have we have
an

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.470 align:start position:0%
an
hour

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
so I think we we saw most of this
 
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
structure type stuff in our previous
 
00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 align:start position:0%
meeting right yes we did so maybe we can
 
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
go straight to to um straight to budget
 
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 align:start position:0%
questions just kind of go through the
 
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
pages does that make sense yeah so when
 
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
don't we start at the end
 
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
um you have um 78 positions for for
 
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
unclassified um are any of those uh
 
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.710 align:start position:0%
unclassified um are any of those uh
vacant

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
unfunded um at this is this on yes okay
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
at this time we do have a couple of
 
00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
positions that are vacant but we do have
 
00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 align:start position:0%
a a strategic plan for those positions
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we have a senior planner position
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
that is vacant currently we are seeking
 
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
a waiver from the governor's office
 
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 align:start position:0%
because it has um that position has FEMA
 
00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 align:start position:0%
requirements it will be
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
um right now we have it in the budget as
 
00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
100% generally funded but we do have we
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
recently learned that we have the
 
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have that position up to
 
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
36% reimbursed from federal funds um
 
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
under the FEMA requirements
 
00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
we do also have a program assistant
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
position that is vacant but it's um and
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
that one is 100% federal funds under the
 
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.390 align:start position:0%
that one is 100% federal funds under the
orid

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
orid
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
program we have a program specialist
 
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
position that is vacant as well at this
 
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
time we
 
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
are as part of the reorganization
 
00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 align:start position:0%
process for the division of um planning
 
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 align:start position:0%
and Community Development we will be
 
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
looking to seek to reclass classify that
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
position as the
 
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.270 align:start position:0%
position as the
um

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 align:start position:0%
the pl office of planning's
 
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
supervisor and we have um I'm sorry yes
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
we have the two housing Champions
 
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
positions those positions were
 
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
authorized in this current bium but they
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
were not funded this bium we're looking
 
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
to fund those two positions in 2627
 
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
because we were in the implementation
 
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 align:start position:0%
phase of housing champions um in this
 
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
bium and in the next bium we expect it
 
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
to be the the program Administration to
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
occur so we will be meing those
 
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
positions to run the program are they
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
funded in here they in this budget
 
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
request they are funded yes okay but
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
they're vacant they're vac currently
 
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't have they're not funded
 
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
in this by and you're under the freeze
 
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
right so yes yeah
 
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
okay and then we do have um we do have a
 
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
listing of temporary positions as well
 
00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
are not um filled at this time we do
 
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
have we do have a waiver to advertise
 
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
for a couple of them at this time and
 
00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
those are for the welcome centers those
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
are filled as uh budget funds allow in
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
class 50 okay great Mr chair if I might
 
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
add go ahead um just to sort of
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
reiterate what Kathy was sharing um the
 
00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
vacant positions are typically related
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
to specific programs and as those
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
programs evolve the need for that
 
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
position may change or increase over
 
00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
time gotcha okay now in general you're
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
looking for another 3.3 million of
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
General funds compared to the previous
 
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.350 align:start position:0%
General funds compared to the previous
banum

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
banum
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
um is there kind of a big picture place
 
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
where most of those are
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
going yeah did you want to speak for
 
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the
 
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
question uh those funds relate
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
specifically or largely to um the
 
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
division of travel and tourism
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
development uh the increase in funding
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
relative to what the agency had
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
presented uh is um what the governor
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
hased proposed based off of the uh what
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
has historically been viewed as the
 
00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
formula that derives the funding for
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
that division so the the funding there
 
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
would go to Industry promotion and
 
00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 align:start position:0%
support a variety of programs and
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
marketing efforts that uh run through
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
that division that wasn't there
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
previously uh it it was not permitted to
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
be there previously because of a
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
regulatory change that had occurred um
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we actually weren't aware of at the
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
time but uh in working with Das provided
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
what was required of US during the
 
00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.070 align:start position:0%
what was required of US during the
agency

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
um proposal and now with the governor's
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
proposal sort of restoring that no I
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
meant compared to the current B oh yeah
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of actual spend yeah yes well
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
it's not just actual right on page
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
537 um adjusted authorized for fiscal
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
year 25 is even less than
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
actual in uh 24 right so correct and
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
that and sorry apologies so and and from
 
00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
both of those numbers it's up 3 point
 
00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
something yeah correct and that is um
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
based on how the formula that derives
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
the revenue for travel and tourism is
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
calculated it's typically 3.15% of the
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
net of meals and rooms tax uh Revenue so
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
this would just be a continuation of the
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
use of that formula to get to that level
 
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
so it's not um it's based on how the
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
funding could be used uh based on the
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
historic um standard for that formula
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay all right well why don't we
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
go back to the beginning and we'll just
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
go kind of section by section um and see
 
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
what's happening in each one so page
 
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:47.270 align:start position:0%
what's happening in each one so page
[Music]

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.990 align:start position:0%

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
right so were any of these two
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
unclassified part year or something like
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
that I apologize Mr chair the the budget
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
on our table is not numbered in terms of
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
top oh at the very top yeah so this is
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
you you your start of your this is
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
Office of the
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
positions correct um in the office of
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner so the unclassified
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
positions would be commissioner Caswell
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
and then the other unclassified position
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
would be the addition of the um
 
00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
intergovermental intergovernmental
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
Affairs position so that position was
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
not there previously gotcha okay all
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
right so that's new okay so one is
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
new is it now filled though yes yeah yes
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
that would be um Genie Forester gotcha
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
all right um the next
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
page um it
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
says uh what is um the source of funds
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
agency indirect cost recoveries what
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
does that mean those are the um indirect
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
cost recoveries for federal funds
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
they're associated with federal funds so
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
those are the F those are the recovery
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
for the recovery funds for the federal
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
funds where um we're paying back um
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
funds to D for doing all of the overhead
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
costs associated with um managing
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
Federal programs I see so so because the
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner part of their job is
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
federal dealing with the federal
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
programs you get to corre to take a
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
little from the I because everything
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
that occurs in the commissioner's office
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
we can't designate to a direct program I
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
can't you know like um office of
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development is federally
 
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
funded and they're very specific to a
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
specific program but because when my
 
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
department the business office is
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
working on a program what we do when
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
we're booking the invoices we're working
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
for every single program in the agency
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
so it's done through our the cost of us
 
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
is done through an indirect cost
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
recovery okay all right now on page 520
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
um so now we're starting the rest areas
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
and you you have the rest areas in two
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
groups one's associated with Turnpike
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
and the other is not correct right so um
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
tell us about just the in general how
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
many rest areas in each how many people
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
uh use the facility ities things like
 
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:34.519 align:start position:0%
that okay so um is that in your
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
presentation somewhere the there are 12
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
rest areas
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
um the Au 2176 is the
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
turnpike and that is the hooks at North
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
and southbound and Seabrook and then the
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
other um rest areas are generally funded
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that were listed by
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell the last time we
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
were here and then we did provide foot
 
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
counts last time we were here so um
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Canterbury coldbrook Intervale Lebanon
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
Littleton Salem Sanbornton Springfield
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
and Sutton would be the ones that are
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
generally funded and between all 12 um
 
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
rest areas we did provide a foot count
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
of 5.8 million in FY
 
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.990 align:start position:0%
of 5.8 million in FY
24

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
well that's for all 12 yes got you
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative wer how many of
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
these are seasonal and how many are year
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
round at this particular time all
 
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
welcome centers were open year round I
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
didn't note that when I've stopped at
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
some we us actually I apologize Sutton
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
is closed currently but all the the rest
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the welcome centers are
 
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.350 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the welcome centers are
open

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
Sutton if I might add Mr chair go ahead
 
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
um just uh noting and I don't know if
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
this made it your way but the hours of
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
operation are typically 9 to5 UM Salem
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
is 8 to 10 seab Brook is 24 hours uh
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
which is a a slight change from preco
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
when most of them were open 8 to eight
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
or or longer hours so as a result of
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
budget changes over that time and um
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
adapting to you know changes in the bvs
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
budget some of the uh locations have had
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
to reduce their
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
hours so there's only like 14 full-time
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
employees in this area right or is that
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
just for the rate for the non turnpike
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
so the four Time full the 14 full-time
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
positions are under the general funds
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
there's an additional 11 under Turnpike
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay so there's 25 and there must be a
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of temps too right there are there
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
are a a large number of temps in both
 
00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
are a a large number of temps in both
areas

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay um could it um could it be shifted
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
more towards
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
temps so in in speaking with the
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
operations manager for that area it
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
would be very difficult to do that
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
because typically when he's doing the
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
scheduling what he tries to do is have
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
one full-time person on per shift so at
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
all times when the welcome center is
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
open there's typically one full-time
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
person who would be a super Bas
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
essentially a supervisor for the center
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
and then it's sub the out the Staffing
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
is subsidized with the part-time people
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
got okay all right good so let's go to
 
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.350 align:start position:0%
got okay all right good so let's go to
page

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
um so there's two people what do these
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
do at this particular
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
no that that was mentioned um by Kathy
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
that referenced orid the outdoor
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
recreation industry development uh so we
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
have one currently one dedicated staff
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
member that uh focuses exclusively on
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
that industry um within broader uh
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
strategies and
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
efforts and it's all fed looks
 
00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:02.949 align:start position:0%
efforts and it's all fed looks
correct

00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
okay all right and what are they doing I
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
mean oh all manner of things so they uh
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
engage businesses that uh are part of or
 
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
support the outdoor recreation industry
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
they're engaged in um trade shows and
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
large scale events effectively marketing
 
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
and supporting what we have available in
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and ensuring that those
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
businesses have the support and
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
assistance they need to navigate
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
whatever issues or challenges they have
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
gotcha go ahead representative evil um
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
hi and I apologize for being late uh the
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
roads were unbelievable yeah um anyway
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
so the federal funding I guess one
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
question was have you had any problem
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
with it in the last couple of months but
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
the other question is what is the source
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
is this a grant that you apply for
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
what's the funding for this position do
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know uh sorry so we have not had
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
problems with receiving reimbursements
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
from this program at this time and um
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
I'm in regular Communications with the
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
agency that administers this right now
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
the funding is coming from USDA and we
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
still have two rounds left to spend um
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
however the funding source is going to
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
be changing and we are working on that
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
now but we anticipate continual funding
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
issue all right now we're going to page
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
um we skip over turnike rest areas we
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
cover that
 
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
525 um Economic
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
Development right where's the toward the
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
bottom there
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
um there's a big jump in the cost of um
 
00:15:45.079 --> 00:15:46.269 align:start position:0%
um there's a big jump in the cost of um
the

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's one unclassified position so
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
was that only filled part year or is
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
this somehow somebody's getting a big
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
raise or what Mr chair you're looking at
 
00:15:58.639 --> 00:15:59.470 align:start position:0%
raise or what Mr chair you're looking at
the

00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
that's him so this my position the
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
director role was unfilled um for a
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
little while and thus the budget was
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
reduced at that time we filled the role
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
and it now accounts for my salary okay
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
great and um what's going on with dues
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
organizational dues that's more than
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
doubling so that's uh in large part a
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
result of our participation in the
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
northern borders Regional Commission so
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
the state um has to contribute a certain
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
amount of administrative funding for the
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh for mbrc itself itself as an entity
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
that's sort of our cost of participation
 
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
and the overall program which provides
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in Grants to um
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
entities around the state in our our
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
mostly rural areas uh so the jump here
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
is simply um an effort to try and better
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
budget for those dues they often hit
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the federal um fiscal year
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't always align well with
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
our state fiscal year so this is in part
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
trying to better stratey that and there
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
has been a slight increase but I think
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
Kathy had more to say yeah the
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
additional comment to that so that does
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
we are statutorily required to pay in
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
the program it's shared between four
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
states in New England and the reason why
 
00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:14.039 align:start position:0%
you're seeing that bump in class 26 is
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
because previously it was incorrectly
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
coded in class one 102 and it is now
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
correctly coded in uh class 26 and that
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
was um that was a correction that was
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
done in conjunction with um Das
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
so you said that there's a lot of grants
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
in this area do we see them in on the
 
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
no um if they are not federally if
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
they're federally funded but not
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
budgeted no you wouldn't see them but
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
you would see um uh our office of
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce opportunity which um receives
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
about what $14 million annually to run
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh training and upskilling programs in
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
partnership with other agencies we also
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
have an apex accelerator program which
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
is uh focused on um helping local
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
businesses engage in Government
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
Contracting and having direct technical
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
assistance as part of that process so
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
those two are coming
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
later uh no the uh those yeah they're
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
already in here no the 14 million for
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
the office of Workforce opportunity is
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
in here is is in is within the DED
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
budget okay so we'll come to it I guess
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
is that yeah okay
 
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
um now also in your group is uh another
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
100,000 for marketing how about that so
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
uh the marketing funding is critically
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
important for what we do as as a a
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
division uh especially in light of some
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
recent um strategies we've and reports
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
we've rolled out and developed a key
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
element of those strategies is better
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
promoting specific growth industries
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
across Ross the state uh to help with uh
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
recruitment efforts expansion efforts
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenges um trying to bring
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
the workforce we need into the state and
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
also bringing awareness to um different
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
Industries so that we can help address
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
supply chain needs uh and different
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
needs of businesses as they grow so it's
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
effectively um targeted funding uh
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for economic development as
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh travel and tourism so we
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
talked about travel and tourism earlier
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
having specific promotion and marketing
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh this a is a very small piece of the
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
pie for economic development specific uh
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
relative to uh industry growth and and
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
assessment so you hadn't been doing it
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
before it's something that we've had in
 
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
the past and we didn't have in the last
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
budget and we felt that it really needed
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
to be there this cycle it was something
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
that we felt was was lacking uh in our
 
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.750 align:start position:0%
that we felt was was lacking uh in our
efforts

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right um yes sorry represent W
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
what effect did we see by not having
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
well this um it's a great question
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
representative it's it's not a specific
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
program it's simply a line item that
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
would would enable enable us to use
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
dollars specifically for marketing and
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
promotion relative to specific indri
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
Industries so I would say one thing we
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
were unable to do was um engage in
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
specific advertising or promotion of say
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
our Advanced manufacturing Industries or
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
Life Sciences things that are industries
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
that are seeing a lot of growth and
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
attention uh that we could really be a
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
partner and helping support that growth
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
it seems like we've had this before and
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
if we took it away was there a big
 
00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:37.070 align:start position:0%
if we took it away was there a big
difference

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
and I yes the short answer the big
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
difference comes from uh what our team
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
and what our division feels they're able
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
to do in terms of supporting the
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
industry which is part of our role and
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
expected of us in many respects so it's
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
not just tourism it's trying to lure
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
businesses to this state no the division
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
of Economic Development has a specific
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
recruitment team so we we have um a
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
staff that's focused on Business
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
Development so recruitment into the
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
state and then a staff that's focused on
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
um business resources which is helping
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
those that are already here expand grow
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
um tackle different challenges uh and we
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
felt um we've been a little bit
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
hamstrung I think on the business
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
recruitment side because we didn't have
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
this in the budget last go
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
around I didn't notice any difference
 
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.750 align:start position:0%
around I didn't notice any difference
thank

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
you okay um all right so now we're going
 
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.390 align:start position:0%
you okay um all right so now we're going
into

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
into uh procurement here page
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
527 all this is related to
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
federal grants for the most part
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
although now you're adding a bunch of
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
General funds to
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
528 so there's an extra
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
person which one's
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
145 oh so Apex sorry uh so this refers
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
to the Apex accelerator program that I
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned that program
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
requires um a state contribution uh to
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
receive the federal funds and run the
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
program itself so we um provide
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
effectively in-kind matches relative to
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
salaries and rent and things of that
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
nature that do uh implicate the the
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
general funds General General Revenue
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
budget okay what so is this is the whole
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
Apex thing part this this uh section
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
namely 500,000 of federal and 200,000 of
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
state is that is that what it is yes
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay and what does it do what does what
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
does it mean Apex so we have a team of
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
three full-time staff one part-time
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
staff that run this program uh they are
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
tasked with managing um support for
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
Government Contracting uh specifically
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
Apex focuses on DOD Contracting uh but
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
all other manner of Government
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
Contracting support as well but a lot of
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
the funding is run through in support of
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
DOD Contracting so they uh work with
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
businesses one-on-one they provide
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
informational webinars they do
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
matchmaking events they can help a
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
business go Soup To Nuts from I want to
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
apply or or on this bid to all the way
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully getting an award and I think
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
if I read the number correctly they
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
helped over 125 businesses last year get
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:37.720 align:start position:0%
okay yeah probably anyway okay so
 
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.950 align:start position:0%
okay yeah probably anyway okay so
um

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
529

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
529
 
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.789 align:start position:0%
529
so

00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
um office of Workforce
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity so here um this is all
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
federal but I was just curious what
 
00:23:59.950 --> 00:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
what's going on with contracts for
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
program Services an
 
00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:03.350 align:start position:0%
program Services an
extra

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
extra
 
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.630 align:start position:0%
extra
$4.3

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
million Mr chair if I recall correctly
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
that had more to do with um the timing
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
of different contracts for services as
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
they were uh the way that program is run
 
00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
there are four or five subrecipients
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
that run targeted aspects of the the
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
training and Outreach programs and I
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
believe that may have just been a result
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the timing of those contracts and
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
when they when they went into place and
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
them this entire office um is required
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
to engage in a multi-year strategic plan
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
and effort based on the specific funding
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
that they're awarded from the federal
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
government so it wouldn't be uh new
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
dollars here unless their award was
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
increased and there's a little tiny bit
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
of general fund here
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
correct any particular reason or that's
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
just to allow occasionally um people
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
within that department will support um
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
other areas in the agency and that that
 
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
allows money for them to support go
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
outside of their own
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
Department okay we try not to tap that
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
if we can't if we don't have to sure
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
just you just give us more detail on the
 
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.750 align:start position:0%
just you just give us more detail on the
federal

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
funds like the sources
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
or oh shoot I think the source might be
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
um Commerce or no E I believe this is
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
all US Department of Commerce yeah
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
Commerce and the money goes to uh most
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
of it a large Chun of It Go chunk of it
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
goes to New Hampshire employment
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
security it goes to the cap program it
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
goes to my turn and it goes to Jag just
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
to add to that there's a coalition
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
basically that was formed to um
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
facilitate these overall this overall
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
program the workface workforce uh
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
Innovation opportunity act weoa um so
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
there are multiple agencies that help
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
facilitate the programs then there are
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
subrecipients that receive grants to run
 
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
specific programs um for displaced
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
workers or even youth programs to help
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
get them the training they might want to
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
get a new job or the upskilling they
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
might need to move from one uh industry
 
00:26:18.919 --> 00:26:20.149 align:start position:0%
might need to move from one uh industry
to

00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
another and one of our hb2 items
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
actually addresses this particular
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
program it's updating all the statutory
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
references um um to this particular
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
program because the ACT that um is
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
regulates this has been
 
00:26:36.039 --> 00:26:37.710 align:start position:0%
regulates this has been
updated

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
updated
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
now um okay so we come to now uh page
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
530 as far as I can tell this is like
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
the only cut that the governor made or
 
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
something close to that and and it's
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
something we're getting a lot of email
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
about so let's talk about that Small
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
Business Development
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
Center going from uh half a million to
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
215 what does that do and it's making
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
grants I guess or or something like that
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
sure so sbdc um is in our view an
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
incredibly important uh program within
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
the state that gives one-on-one
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to uh new and small
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
businesses around the state um from
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
everything from you know how to start a
 
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
business to some legal and financial
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
guidance based on you know a recent
 
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
Grant they received on on efforts that
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
they can do so uh it's not it's not
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily a cut that we're happy about
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
but when we look at the targets that we
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
have to hit uh it was one of the only
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
areas that we really felt that we even
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
had any room or a choice to make with
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
regard to that so it was a it a
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
difficult prioritization in terms of
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
what the overall mission of the agency
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
does and and how we're able to partner
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
with others so this is some kind of NGO
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
type of thing right ferally funded or
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a federal program that has
 
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
representation in I think every state um
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
so they have an entity in Sp spdc in
 
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919 align:start position:0%
across the country and they have a very
 
00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:10.470 align:start position:0%
across the country and they have a very
defined

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
role I see and I think we got some a
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of data here right from them that
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
we can look at yes it's it's without
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
question they have an enormous impact
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
for sure yes go ahead representative
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you for taking my question
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
U you you people apparently get a lot
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
lot of federal
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
funds how many of them or what
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
percentage of those funds require a
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
level of uh State matching any level of
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
State matching or is it all just free
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
you don't have to match any of
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
it you can jump on this with me but
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
there's it's certainly not all free
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
there are a few programs that require
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
some level of State match um the Apex
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
accelerator that we were just talking
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
about being one of them um a percentage
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
requirement uh but I would say as as a
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
result of the funding that we have
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
coming into the agency what less than
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
half of our overall budget is actually
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
generally funded um so we get uh For
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
What Little Skin we have to have in the
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
game to get those federal funds we're
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
able to do a lot with them could we get
 
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
a list of the federal funds that requ
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
state matching in the percentage sure
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely all right
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
representative evil yes thank you just
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
following up on the um Small Business
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
Development comp I I can't imagine there
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
was there we haven't heard from uh on
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
any cut as much right now as we have on
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
this particular one and um I mean it
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
seems like the based on the emails that
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
we're getting from a business standpoint
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
it seems like the return on the
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
investment is huge for our state um and
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
so I you know I know Cuts need to be
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
made but I think this particular one is
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
maybe cutting through the muscle and
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
into the bone and um anyway I realize we
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of money to throw
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
around but I think this one for a couple
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
hundred, dollar might be worth helping
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
out just a little bit so I don't know
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
just keep I'm just amazed at the at the
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
uh I mean can you talk about the ROI on
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more or do you want to
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
wait on this discussion you can go ahead
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay cuz you said there was a lot of
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
there kind of on on time I think so yeah
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry am I answering the question
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay um we have this yeah so
 
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
that was actually provided by sbdc who's
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
in the room so I can't speak to to
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
what's in the folder but I absolutely
 
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
agree um each annual report that sbdc
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
kicks out there's um enormous bang for
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
the buck in terms of what they're able
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
to do and how many businesses they're
 
00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
able to reach I think if I'm remembering
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
correctly they were able to engage close
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
to 2,000 businesses last year uh and
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
helpful in that regard with as you said
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative a relatively small amount
 
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.629 align:start position:0%
representative a relatively small amount
of

00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:03.639 --> 00:31:05.149 align:start position:0%
of
money

00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
okay representative cambrell thank you
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um is the program receiving any
 
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.629 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um is the program receiving any
federal

00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
funding I believe the answer to that
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
question is yes uh I believe they have a
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
a grant through um
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
ssbci um and there may be one other they
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
may have received about $100,000 in arpa
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
funding previously but I don't know if
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
that money is already exhausted at this
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
point so that would be important for us
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
to know how much they're getting if if
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
you could get that amount absolutely or
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
maybe if we're through with these guys a
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
little bit early we can ask them to come
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'm sorry about that and um
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
um are there uh currently small
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
businesses like waiting in line to get
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
loans is there a waiting list for this
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
uh for these uh assistance I'm not aware
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
of a waiting list but if we're going to
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
bring spdc up at some point after this
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
it might be a better question to ask
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
them okay and I will just add sorry if I
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
may follow up real quick representative
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
just add that um you know like with
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
anything if spdc does receive federal
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
funding which I believe they do it's
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
probably for a very specific purpose so
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily generally
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
applicable there may be a specific
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
program that they're running that they
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
support with those
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
funds all right so next on page 530 what
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
Grant um the capacity grant that relates
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
to the nbrc program that we mentioned
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
earlier the northern B northern border
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
Regional Commission the capacity Grant
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
is the federal funding the state
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
receives to administratively run that
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
program um within the state so there is
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
a staff person uh dedicated to
 
00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:51.669 align:start position:0%
a staff person uh dedicated to
overseeing

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
overseeing
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
mbrc and uh helping facilitate multiple
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
program rounds for you know application
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
rounds for for programs helping provide
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
technical assistance and then also uh
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
overseeing um uh a contractor that
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
that's supports the technical assistance
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
overall gotcha and those are all federal
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
funds gotcha yeah all right so now we're
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
going to travel and
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
tourism and U page
 
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.110 align:start position:0%
tourism and U page
232

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
232
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
um so there's Marketing in a couple of
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
different ways here um there's uh
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
promotional marketing
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
expense and then there's um Grant
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
relief right and then later on um we're
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
going to see um
 
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
what oh at the bottom of the page
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
promotional marketing
 
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.789 align:start position:0%
promotional marketing
expense

00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
expense
 
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
um or is that the same no that's
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
different so what's the difference
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
between line 69 in accounting unit uh
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
203 and what we see at the bottom of the
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
page they're basically categorized
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
categorized differently based on the
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
type of recipient and the program that
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
is being um awarded
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
out yeah so if I may follow up it's just
 
00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:28.270 align:start position:0%
out yeah so if I may follow up it's just
a

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
a budgeted amount based on how the
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
funding is likely to be used so if we um
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
I'll give an example the uh Grant
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
subsidies and relief that you mentioned
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
that's called The Joint that that
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
supports that money is used for the
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
joint promotional program which is a
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
grant program so we would issue grants
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
um through that specific line in in in
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
our accounting system versus having it
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
all pulled in one generic and we we
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
break it out based on the class and how
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay so both of these are going up
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
substantially right so
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
um one is up uh looks like 990,000 the
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.270 align:start position:0%
 
million

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
yes all right um and I I'll just speak
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
to you know I I mentioned the joint
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
promotional program uh that's going up
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
proposed to go up to 1.25 million that's
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
an incredibly successful program where
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
um grants are given typically to
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
Chambers or different trade associations
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
for um promotional events across the
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
state like bike week or restaurant week
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
or the seafood festival uh and it's it's
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
a way for us to um partner with those
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
tourism related efforts and support and
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
lower some of the cost to entry to even
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
have those events so it's often an over
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
subscribed program uh so we're budgeting
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
for an increase in it so that we can
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about grants yes okay yes
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
what about
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
marketing uh which line 69 well 69 and
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
the other 69
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
both which other
 
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
69 okay right you have 69 in the middle
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
of the page and you have 69 right at the
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page oh sorry I my the
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
fold of my pages uh so the if I
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
understand correctly the 69 at the
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page would be largely
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
where we uh would concentrate um the
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
tourism focused advertising and
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
promotion funding that we talked a bit
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
earlier about the formula change and the
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
increase in funding for how it' be used
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of it would be put there so that
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
it could be used for broader marketing
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
campaigns which are often pretty
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
expensive but have to be so this is tv
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
ads and things like that what's that TV
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
ads uh print uh online TV um video I
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
mean when you when you look at and you
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
may have seen this in our our followup
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
um from the last presentation but um
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's actually a pretty phenomenal
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
return on investment for use of these
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
funds it's one of the only funds that we
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
can take meals and and and rooms tax
 
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
revenue and help generate substantially
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
more Revenue by the number of tourists
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
were're able to bring in as a result of
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
marketing I have a feeling that when you
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
return on investment you're saying we
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
spent this we and the total amount of
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
tourism in New Hampshire is that and you
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
say one is creating from the other right
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
see H have you done experiments where
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
this number gets smaller and therefore
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
that number got smaller yeah yes so I
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
apologize um there is a a contractor
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
that travel and tourism works with to
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
derive the ROI number it's not just
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
pulled out of a thin air they they
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
interview um tourist they create a an
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
econom a model for it and are able to co
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
this is a professor at Plymouth
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
yes no this the the SM report that we
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
provided to you as followup from our
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
last testimony that's the company now
 
00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
that company works with uh approximately
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
25 States across the country so they are
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
very well-versed in providing these
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
types of studies it's also important to
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
note that the the people that they are
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
surveying are all people who are
 
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
visiting our state they're not residents
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
of our state so the return on investment
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
um you know our travel and tourism
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
department wants us to be aware that
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
these are funds they don't believe would
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
actually come into our state if not for
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
spending this money because when they're
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
doing these studies they're going out
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
and if they've advertised in a test
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
market like New York City for example
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're advertising New York
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
City they're now going out and they're
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
they're doing doing their study in New
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
York City to determine what the return
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
on investment in that advertising was so
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
you came to our state now and youve
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
spent this money how much did you spend
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
in order to determine the the ROI and so
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
now they believe the the study is saying
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
that this money would not have been
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
spent here because now they would have
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
seen an ad and they would have gone to
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
Florida instead they would have gone to
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
California so so the belief is that this
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
money would not have come into our state
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
if not for these this advertising
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
advertising being spent and that's why
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's considered so important and I will
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
just add that it is it is a highly
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
competitive environment a lot of States
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
invest a decent amount of funding in
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
this kind of promotion and so retracting
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
from that or regressing from that and
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
based on what Kathy just said and what
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
you see in some of these reports could
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on the amount of
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax revenue that comes
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
in I get all right any other questions
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
on this area no okay um let's move on to
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
let's see get
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
533 uh planning and Community
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
so is this Regional planning is this
 
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.670 align:start position:0%
so is this Regional planning is this
something

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
else so we're talking about the whole
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
division so the division of planning and
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
Community Development uh is also part of
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
what you see in um the reorganization
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
and hb2 uh some of the language you have
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
there uh what it does is it pulls three
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
um different not different but three
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
related areas of focus for the agency so
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
we have the uh office of Planning and
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
Development uh which um has existed with
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
Bea for a few years now uh that focuses
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
on Municipal level um uh technical
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
assistance mapping uh helping uh assess
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
land use regulations and make
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations with communities as they
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
work with them uh then we also have the
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
other two teams that are being added
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
into this division um which focus on
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
housing so they run oversee the invest
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
and H program and the housing Champions
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
program and then we have a Broadband
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
team um that is in here as well uh that
 
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
focuses on the Broadband infrastructure
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
buildout that is underway so those three
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
groups or three offices are brought
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
together under under the division of
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
planning and Community Development where
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
this was previously just the office of
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
Planning and Development within baa
 
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
question representative W isn't there a
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
lot of overlap with the regional
 
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.910 align:start position:0%
lot of overlap with the regional
planning

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
commissions it's a great question I
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
would say no because our staff uh focus
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
focuses in specifically on uh the the
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
needs of municipalities and partnering
 
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
with other uh entities like the regional
 
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
planning commissions and the municipal
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
Association so there isn't typically a
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
lot of overlap but there is a lot of
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
coordination and
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
collaboration thank you representative
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
evil hi I'm I realize so this is the
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
this is the department is it right it
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
was once a division and now you want to
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
make it an office or something so it was
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
this the one this is the one okay yeah
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
this is the one so this is an office
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
that would now be one of three offices
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
within a division okay so previously uh
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
the divisions at Bea were Economic
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
Development and travel and tourism this
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
is a third formal division pulling those
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
three offices together because um
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
although there's not not a lot of
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
overlap in what they do there's a lot of
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh ability to um work together and and
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
collaborate and coordinate efforts and
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
then sort of cross collaborate as a team
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
internally so if you've got our housing
 
00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:42.559 align:start position:0%
program that's housing Champions that's
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
working with uh communities with
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects or um permitting
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
units um our office of Planning and
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
Development can be a resource as well
 
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
for that program staff but also the
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
communities that are engaging in those
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
programs the same can be said about
 
00:42:56.839 --> 00:42:58.470 align:start position:0%
programs the same can be said about
Broad

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
Broad
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
okay so some of the structural changes
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
that we see in hb2 they're not so much
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
really structural changes it's just kind
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
of a shifting around correct yes okay
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
and then um so on the draft of hb2 that
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
we have which you probably don't have
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
it's page 43 there's $5 million in here
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
for the housing Champion program yes so
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
is that in hb1 or is this new spending
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
so I can answer but you can double down
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
it but that $5 billion already exists
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
based off of the previous legislative
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
session all this does in hb2 is extend
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
the time for the funding to be used so
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
it previously sunsetted June 30th of
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
2025 the end of this fiscal year uh and
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
we're extending it seeking to extend it
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
until the end of next year uh just
 
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
because none of it has been spent it's
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
or knit next to it is answering the
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
question delicately it's not that it
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't been spent it's that the last
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
year to year and a half there was a lot
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
of setup that had to be done for those
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
programs including going through the
 
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
administrative uh rulemaking process uh
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
the housing Champions program itself has
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
a staff member we're certainly utilizing
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
that funding the initial application
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
round has already run there were 18
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
communities that were designated housing
 
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
Champions and now those 18 communities
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
can apply for two different programs
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
that I believe are currently open for
 
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.589 align:start position:0%
that I believe are currently open for
application

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh which frankly will draw at the result
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
of those applications will likely take
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
up all the funding for the program uh
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
but there is a little bit of concern
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
that if we need to run an additional
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
round of the program that we wouldn't be
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
able to do that before the end of June
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
so this is more of a a play of sort of
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
taking a cautionary approach to make
 
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
sure um we can adequately run that
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
program so where does that $5 million
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
show up in your budget or is it some
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
it's already on our stat it's already on
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
our statement of Appropriations
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
currently okay so it would just be a
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
carry forward amount because it was a
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
2425 thing correct is there a 26 27
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
similar appropriation or no not at this
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
time okay but yet you're keeping the the
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
office right the housing Champions
 
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
office on page
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
535 is still there so well the program
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
itself there um there are two programs
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
that are run there's the housing
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
Champions program and now a state funded
 
00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:33.079 align:start position:0%
invest and age program um then there's
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
also the reality that the housing
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
Champions program is a multi-year
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
program that will also require oversight
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
of of the projects that are given uh
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
grant funding so the housing Champion
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
designation is on a three-year cycle and
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
then uh we run multiple application
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
rounds a year for more and more
 
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
communities to become designated housing
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
Champions so even if
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
we chew up all $5 million in this award
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
round there's still a lot of
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
administrative work and oversight that
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be done on the program itself
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's why the office would need to
 
00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:11.079 align:start position:0%
continue okay so uh is the RSA noted
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
here in association with the
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
Appropriations I I just wanted to check
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
the um statutory structure of the
 
00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:19.150 align:start position:0%
the um statutory structure of the
housing

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
Champions program I don't know if it's
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the hb2 language it's I
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
just see 79 colon 46 the LBA can yeah I
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
mean it's in our it's in Ba's RSA 12-
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:39.710 align:start position:0%
 
structure

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay and now um Broadband so this
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
is all federal looks like is that
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
right or mostly yes go ahead
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
represent first let me apologize for
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
being late it was a slippery ride we
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
understand uh just going back to the
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
housing that's obviously been a major
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
concern of the executive branch and
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
legislative branch so did you put any
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
request in for additional monies on top
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
of the five million that's kind of left
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
over so there'd be more money available
 
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
for 26 and 27 should that five money
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
five million be
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
expended I'd be hesitant to speak on
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of the commissioner or our
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
director of intergovernmental Affairs
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
but I know that the team has worked with
 
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
legislators as they've come forward with
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
interest in putting funding into those
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
programs I don't know the status of of
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
that legislation though but you're not
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
aware of any request that was made by
 
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
your department to get additional money
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
correct we didn't proactively say please
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
give us this amount of money for this
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
program okay thanks thanks Mr chair that
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of okay yeah that's fine
 
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
thanks let see have a correction of that
 
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
all right so they they were hb2 items
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
last time so we were not allowed to put
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
it in agency budget so Broadband you got
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
a new um Federal grant is
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
that yes so Broadband is um complicated
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
Beast uh all federal funding but
 
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
different sources of federal funds so
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's uh what's currently being built
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
out right now through the American
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
Rescue plan act capital projects fund uh
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
the state received about 122 million
 
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
dollars there uh to build out Broadband
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure access and build out
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
Broadband infrastructure and provide
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
access to unserved and underserved
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
locations based off of FCC Maps so
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
there's currently um two major build
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
outs underway that'll bring over 50,000
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
households or locations access to
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
high-speed internet and then uh then
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
what we're coming up on is the um what's
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
called The Bead program and it's another
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
about $191 million um you don't see
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
numbers of that magnitude in here that's
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
just the big picture uh the money that
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
we've received um because those programs
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
are on a draw down typically relate to
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and running the
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
program and setting it up uh with the
 
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
exception of the arpa funding that's
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
already all um obligated and being spent
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
out are you saying $100 million in New
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes yes is being spent on this
 
00:49:17.549 --> 00:49:17.559 align:start position:0%
kind of thing yes I
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
see representative I remember an Alec
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
conference where they talked about it
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
was almost a billion coming to New
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that was like two years ago
 
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
and hardly anything has happened
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
Broadway interesting okay all right so
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead yes we did talk about this
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
program at the last presentation where
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
we've already received $5 million on
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
this and there's another $191 million
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
allocation it was included in the
 
00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:44.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up presentation provided and so
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
this is an estimate of the
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
administrative costs expected and then
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
we are actually currently looking to
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
bring um $12 million in right now
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
because as the next allocation into
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal and this will help sustain the
 
00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:02.839 align:start position:0%
office um so that we we can um
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
effectively run the office in the next
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
budget cycle and there's still more
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
money to be brought in if I may add Mr
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
chair yeah go ahead so one thing to add
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
on to what Kathy was saying and the
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
reason why I called it a bit complicated
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
at the outset wasn't to diminish our
 
00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:19.799 align:start position:0%
ability to understand it but to point
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
out that it is federally regulated and
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
there are defined steps in the process
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
so the office has had to develop several
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
multi-year plans on how they're going to
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
use the funding uh where it's going to
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
be um awarded and they're amidst final
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
steps of of doing that so they've had to
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
do uh to get approval on two major plans
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then they have to run a whole
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
application program that will lay that
 
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
will identify who is actually getting
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
money from that $191 million and once
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
that is complete then we have to get
 
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
approval of it so it's not unfortunately
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a a quick injection or use of
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
funding it's a multi-year process that's
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
pretty when you say the office I don't
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
see any people here so it's somewhere
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
else so the the staff is fully federally
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
funded correct yeah so we had there
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
are four I believe they're currently
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
paid out of an off-budget Broadband
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
account correct they're n 9t positions
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
yeah oh so there's a dedicated fund yes
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay all right so we'll we'll take a
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
look at that maybe all right
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
good okay four people so this is the end
 
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.349 align:start position:0%
good okay four people so this is the end
of

00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
um uh Bea do we have other question
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
Bea yeah I mean this is it I know the
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner's not here so yeah all
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
right representative all I was going to
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
say on the housing Champions I didn't
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
notice it when we're talking about it
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
but it's on page 534 down at the bottom
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
there it talks about the admin
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
administrative expense I think that we
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
were talking about just so you see where
 
00:52:01.319 --> 00:52:02.390 align:start position:0%
were talking about just so you see where
it

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
is yeah right right it they they started
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
a little yeah this year and then and
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
then there's more ongoing yeah um and I
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
actually I know Mike Li Liberty I know
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
he's been really involved in the
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
broadband and he's really um excited
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
about the progress that you guys are
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
making and you know if you have to
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
develop plans it shows that they're
 
00:52:27.549 --> 00:52:27.559 align:start position:0%
expending funds carefully right exactly
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
and we're if I might add we're our goal
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
is 100% access across the state with
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
these funds so we're well well on our
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:38.069 align:start position:0%
way to
that

00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so we have about five minutes
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
budget thank you so your name is my name
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
is Jason Canon I'm the associate state
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
director for the
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
spdc okay so what can you tell us about
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
what you
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
do um what I do or what the organization
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
the organization um so the sbdc program
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
is a program that's um been around for
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
over 45 years it was created by the
 
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
small business act there's a Small
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
Business Development Center in every
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
state in US Territory so there's
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
63 um around the country um it's
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
federally funded based on a population
 
00:53:45.069 --> 00:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
funding formula and that funding does
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
require State match so here in New
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we receive uh this current
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
year almost $800,000 from the federal
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
government which does require a match of
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
which this 50 or um yes 50 50% has to be
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
cash 50% can be in in kind um and this
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
match okay and what do you do with the
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
money I'm sorry what do you do with
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
these funds with these funds so
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
specifically the funds from the state
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
every dollar from the state goes right
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
into paying for business advisors that
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
help small businesses so um we have
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
about 14 business advisors the of about
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
10 full you know FTE some of them are
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
part-time um and they work around the
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
state helping small businesses um
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
everything from I have an idea and I
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
want to start a business to exit
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
strategies it could be resiliency
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
planning business planning marketing
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
cyber security a lot on cyber security
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
um right
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
now so and we were actually in the last
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
five years demand for those Services has
 
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
gone up over 120% in five years
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay so is it something like score is
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
that it's a little bit different score
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
is volunteers um so they're they're
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
retired um people who used to work in uh
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
in business not necessarily small
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
businesses um all of our advisers are go
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
through a certification process they all
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
have experience owning a business
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
running a business they all have
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
mbas um they do professional development
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
but all of our services are at no cost
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers I see so if one more
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
question then I'll let represent Camal
 
00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:31.799 align:start position:0%
so you said there are 14 of them for yes
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
14 total some are part-time some are
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
full-time there's about 10 full-time
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
equivalents so if the governor's budget
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
went through presumably it would go down
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
to seven or something like that yes we
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
would lose three full-time business
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
advisers about 30% of our advising
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
capacity um at a time when we're seeing
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
historic numbers of small businesses
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
looking for assistance gotcha all right
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative camell thank
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh uh does have you ever do
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
you always spend all the money every
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
year or so there's no rolling over
 
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
there's no current balance in the fund
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
no there is not no we we we get it for
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
two years and we typically spend it down
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
by the end each year spend it down by
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
the end of the the year so currently
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
your balance would be zero or uh yes
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
whatever is left for this current year
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
we would have thank you representative
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
for being here to take our questions I
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
guess let's say in in the absence of
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
sbdc would it then fall to the the banks
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
or to like Chambers of Commerce to um
 
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure because they refer their
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
clients to us yeah um we get a lot lot
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
of referrals from banks for people that
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
are looking to get Capital but they
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
don't have a business plan ready so we
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Partners in Banks Chambers
 
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with um a lot of
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
the big Chambers and the small Chambers
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
they send a lot of clients to us um
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
especially during Co they were getting
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
calls you know from businesses they know
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
what to do and they were calling us cuz
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
we were the ones that were answering the
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
phone so I'm not sure they would either
 
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:04.039 align:start position:0%
have to go to another provider like
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
score which you know would kind of
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
overwhelm I assume overwhelm uh their
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
capacity um or they would have to pay
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
for those Services if they
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
could representative evil thank you Mr
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
chair so just getting back to my return
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
on investment question um and just
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
taking a survey of the amazing number of
 
00:57:29.789 --> 00:57:29.799 align:start position:0%
emails enthusiastic emails that we've
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
gotten um could you just talk a little
 
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.349 align:start position:0%
gotten um could you just talk a little
bit

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
about your assessment of how much
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
support and how successful your program
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
is sure we've um there's a couple of
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
different measures there's one um we
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
have a National Association that does an
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
annual study to determine that uh return
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
on investment and they have determined
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
that every dollar invested in an sbdc
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
program returns back $10 um in in tax
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
revenue um here in New Hampshire we
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
worked with an economist at the
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire to develop a
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
metric to determine um what that annual
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
impact is on the economy it's based on
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
um jobs created jobs save business
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
starts Capital infusion um along with um
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire employment security
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
data of average wages um and for the
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
current year the impact that the sbdc
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
has is over $245 million on the
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
economy re people so I mean I guess I
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
asked that question and I know
 
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
everything's being cut pretty tight but
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
like I look at the $700 billion
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
marketing program you could take2 200 or
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
$250,000 from that which would be a very
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
small portion of it and fund it in a way
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
that it seems an awful lot of small
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
business folks would like to see it
 
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's one television ad in the
 
00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.630 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's one television ad in the
market

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
thing I mean I don't I don't know how
 
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
much that would really Buy in the in the
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
in the world of marketing but it's seems
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
to me that this is a really meaningful
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
program to an awful lot of people I I
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
would agree it's a relatively small
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
amount and just that amount of money the
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
275,000 um three business advisers were
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
talking probably two to 300 small
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
businesses that wouldn't be assisted you
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
know a few thousand hours of advising
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of jobs that are not created or
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
saved millions of dollars that are not
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
infused into small businesses whether
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's Equity Capital owner investment
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
loans SBA and non SBA backed um and
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
probably a couple dozen small businesses
 
00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.990 align:start position:0%
probably a couple dozen small businesses
not

00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
started thank you thank you all right um
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
so I think we're can I just get your
 
00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
name for the record again it's Jason
 
00:59:51.079 --> 00:59:53.549 align:start position:0%
name for the record again it's Jason
Canon

00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:53.559 align:start position:0%
Canon
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
C all right we are going to move on on
 
00:59:57.039 --> 00:59:58.150 align:start position:0%
C all right we are going to move on on
to

00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
das I believe is that right yes
 
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.190 align:start position:0%
das I believe is that right yes
um

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
101

01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
101
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
H yeah we're going to start on page
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
101 I think which is the end of this
 
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.870 align:start position:0%
101 I think which is the end of this
group

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
here well yeah that's their attached
 
01:00:47.029 --> 01:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:55.570 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.570 --> 01:01:04.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:07.029 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
so so how's your wife Mr commissioner um
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
please turn on
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
you she uh uh it's probably a fractured
 
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
kneecap not a broken but what that means
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
is you can't move it or it will break
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
which means she can't move which is
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
awkward cuz um she's a full-time
 
01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
caretaker for Henry oh and she can't
 
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
move so I'm rning around this morning
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
like cooking and getting clothes out and
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
like trying to sort things out and go
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
all right here say a lunch here and he
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
can heat it up and then I'll be back
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
later I have to go get yelled at by a
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
bunch of legislators so will she be in
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
the cast or um it's funny they have her
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
in like one of those things that's like
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
a brace and I think she wants a cast cuz
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
she's scared to death of bending sure
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
and so I don't know we'll see but we
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
were it's funny because I went and
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
picked her up last night and um we're
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
coming out of like conquered Ortho acute
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it's called and uh so I hold a
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
door for her and then the guy behind her
 
01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
Court it's a and a neighbor of ours so
 
01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
it's a bad day for
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
Canterbury I have to say I snapped my
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
kneecap in half this summer so you you
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
if she can maintain it at fracture level
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
and not break um it's worth
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
doing that's good to know thank you for
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah well it was a granite step
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
that got me I thought it was a very New
 
01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:42.470 align:start position:0%
that got me I thought it was a very New
Hampshire

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
injury I think it is
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:02:48.079 --> 01:02:50.190 align:start position:0%
okay all right
so

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
um we have here let's go to page
 
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
101 uh
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the department of administrative
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
services so this is
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
an I mean this looks very excellent on
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
the on the paper um uh General funds
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
declining from 75 million in fiscal year
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
2024 to 61 in
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
2026 but I'll I'll say that there's a
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of a cheat here because
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's a 21 million doll land
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
acquisition in
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
2024 so so there is some increase um
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
except for
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
that oh no absolutely we in fact we were
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
talking about that in the hallway that
 
01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
that that's the source of the increase
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it comes up a lot uh um in the
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
accounting system actual so the actual
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
expense line includes anything including
 
01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
things that weren't part of the budget
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
that are added to it and and we had to
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
buy we had byy a building so so that
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
does in fact make it look so what do we
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
buy for 21 million oh uh Granite Place
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
Granite place where doj is now so we'll
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
have a place to have the legislature for
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
are we going to be next year next year
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that Terry has all
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of things going on with that and
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
you would really want to ask him oh
 
01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
that's nice how about that okay I all
 
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:19.660 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.589 align:start position:0%
right so
[Music]

01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
um so of the um 330 people people we see
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
here tell us about vacancies and so let
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
if I can and I'll I'll explain so um
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
Sher will have passed out to you two
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
things to try to make this piece easier
 
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
um one the second thing which looks like
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
this is actually this same document with
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
lines and
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
Deltas so it's it shows the change and
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's easier to read and and we
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
highlighted anything over 100 Grand
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
change um not that we can't talk about
 
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
everything else but with thought that
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
might make it easier CU rumor is that's
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
what you want to talk about is lines
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
that changed the other thing on that
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
handout if you notice for example you're
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the very front page um it'll
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
say on the kind of dead center page 55
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
yep that's the exact same page reference
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
as in your big house bill one so we
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
literally took everything from there
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
just added the change between the two
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
years so you could easily see the you
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have to do the math on the Fly
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
because our accting units be have about
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
50 pages so we added that but those page
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
references match exactly to your book
 
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
and same layout format so it would be a
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
be able to go through that so we can
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
highlight of those sides and then at the
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
very bottom of the slide can you do this
 
01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:39.860 align:start position:0%
for the whole
 
01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:45.349 align:start position:0%
for the whole
[Laughter]

01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
book it might take a
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
while just that would be easy to kind of
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
draw your eye and we you know can go
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
through that um afterwards but as
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
Charlie mentioned we put together a it's
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
a very short presentations about 10
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
slides um we wanted to walk through that
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
first because there's three that just
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
talk about positions and they're sort of
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
the first three and then we have some
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
high level dollars before we get into
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
the detail all right so I'll let you do
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
that okay okay so page one is a title
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
page two is is the graph I'm so proud of
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
I mean we went down 7% everybody else
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
went up 40 right and I'm not going to
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
stop saying that um but then uh to show
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
you what happened in the in the agency
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
and governor phase um from our from
 
01:06:30.269 --> 01:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
where we were in 25 which was down seven
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
we went down another four which means
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
we're you know down 11 from 2019 but
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
then 27 obviously goes up um a bit
 
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:41.799 align:start position:0%
although we're still well down from 19
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
um and Sherry has called out in a giant
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
bubble um what those increases are 3.2
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
is retire Health one is the step and
 
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:51.799 align:start position:0%
salary increases that are natural with
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
benefits so positions you want us to
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
know about positions as long as we're on
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
this tell me about retiree Health what
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
what do we what are we obligated for
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
this is basically um Medicare Advantage
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
is that what it is or
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's I mean Medicare Advantage is the
 
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
delivery mechanism for how we cover
 
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
retire our Medicare retirees right so
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
but the law um provides for a retire
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
health benefit plan establishes
 
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility and further says that it may
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
must be operated by Das Within the funds
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the legislature so
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the obligation is is
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
it only state employees is it municipals
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
it is it is only state employees and
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
they must meet years of State service
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
requirements and those were tightened up
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
by the legislature beginning in in 2009
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
and age requirements as well okay
 
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
representative wer one of my retired
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
friends tells me this reduction is
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
Caroline and they're doing a lousy job
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
that's why that's reduced um so I think
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
they're separate things counselor um
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh we certainly the
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
savings that we achieved in the chart
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
that um I think it's in your package too
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
but we we looked at it last time we were
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
here if you recall it's BEC it's because
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
we went to Medicare Advantage and we
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
leveraged Federal funding right um and
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
that obviously has been very very good
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire and for
 
01:08:24.719 --> 01:08:26.189 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire and for
retirees

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
retirees
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
um Caroline's poor performance to me is
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
a separate issue we go out to bid we um
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
Anthem won the bid for both medical
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
coverage and Pharmacy coverage and I
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
explained to this to you folks when we
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
were last here we didn't know that they
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
had started their own PBM and we further
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
didn't know that they really weren't
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
ready okay and that's the kind of stuff
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
that companies do and Pull and that's
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
what we had to manage our way through
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
and we have and we're back back to uh
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
sort of level set at least he hasn't
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
complained to me lately yeah but but he
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
was right to complain I have complained
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
too by the way and he should also feel
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
free to complain to us we have a office
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's there for that um the other thing
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
I I want to add the savings aren't just
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
that um the initial savings were
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
generated in part by deciding to go to
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage
 
01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
for medical not prescription the car on
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
Pieces Just when we rolled prescription
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
in a year ago and and not that it wasn't
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
horrible but it was horrible so anyway
 
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
so that that's retire Health okay but
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
there's no savings unlike pensions right
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
where there's savings that pay for that
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here for that right I
 
01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's pay as you go it's a it's
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
a just a benefit right but it's a
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
benefit to people who worked for us a
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
long time ago
 
01:09:59.790 --> 01:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
um or maybe last year or maybe in
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
December yeah yeah yeah but it but you
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
know we don't do that with pensions no
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
we don't you and so so this is a
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
decision the state has made historically
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
there have been debates back and forth
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
on it about whether you fund a benefit a
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
pension plan or not we report regularly
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
on on the OPB obligation as that's
 
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
called um some of you who go back a few
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
years we'll remember that um
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk in particular who
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
was a who was a longtime chairman of
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
house finance and and and had very
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
strong opinions um believe very strongly
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
in not reserving for retire health and
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I think at the end of the
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
day if you want to go there at some
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
point we can outline the arguments for
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
reserving and against um but it the uh
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal in particular was generally
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
hostile to any notion of of
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
saving and and and allowing this to be
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
paid as you go in part cuz um the theory
 
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
change oh but if you want to reserve we
 
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
can work out a plan for you for that so
 
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.630 align:start position:0%
can work out a plan for you for that so
you're

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
saying we're not obligated to pay this
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
money we are right it's a it's a you
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
some part of the population who was not
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
vested from needing 10 years to needing
 
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
20 years I see um you can make changes
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
like that and and and there are
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
debates I would want the union to give
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
you their perspective on on whe on what
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
you can change and what you can't change
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
to before saying anything definitive I
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
suppose if we if we did it via savings
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
then we would be taking money
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
essentially from anybody
 
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
everybody and only giving it to those
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
who last 20
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
years is that right I mean it's it's
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's the problem yes I mean it's one
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
of the equity issues with funding right
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
with funding that way with with
 
01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
prefunding the debt is who are you
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
taking money from and are they going to
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
get that benefit or not we have an
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
obligation under the law I think
 
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
everyone knows this that that all the
 
01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.750 align:start position:0%
everyone knows this that that all the
money

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
collected for the purpose of the healthc
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
care benefit both retired benefit and
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
the and the active benefit um uh through
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
a mechanism called fund 60 must be used
 
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
for that and we may not take money under
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
the um and pretend it's for health care
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
and then not use it for healthare I mean
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
not that we want to we don't want to but
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
we're not legally allowed to so that
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
comes up sometimes sure okay so this is
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
a but this is a giant part of the
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
general fund here right because half of
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
our general fund ballpark our isn't it
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
like 50 million a year no
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's 35
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
I want yeah and and that's probably page
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
98 or something like that let me give
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
you the exact amount 30 and 33 actually
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
yeah if you look on page 30 okay P page
 
01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
seven of the short hand out okay um has
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
that information it's also on page 100
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
of yeah so it's like half the general
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
funds half of our 50% of our budget yeah
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
ium okay let's go on to this okay so
 
01:13:23.229 --> 01:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
positions you want to talk about
 
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
positions these are the positions we
 
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
have so slide three um slide three is an
 
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
overview and then slides four and five
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
are line items or people items um we
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
divided so you understand uh how it
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
works into plant and property and we we
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
talked last time a little bit about how
 
01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
plant and property is is people and
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
programs are sort of mixed in in that um
 
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
risk which has no General funds um uh
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
that governs any of their positions and
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
then operations which is the rest of our
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
department that's you know procurement
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
and it's everything and where the
 
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
reductions are so we go from
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
3 uh 330 and we go down 29 so far and so
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's most of our
 
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
positions and uh most of our currently
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
vacant positions before I tell you what
 
01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
vacant positions are I want to say
 
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
something about what vacant positions
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
aren't this is a snapshot in time and I
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
said to someone the fact that Gail left
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
last week and her position is suddenly
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
vacant doesn't mean we weren't using it
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
if I break my leg and I'm limping I
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
don't want you to amputate my leg
 
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm not planning on using it and
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
still ask me to run a marathon and so so
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
just cuz someone leaves and the position
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
is vacant next week or last week doesn't
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
mean we weren't didn't have plans for it
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
now internally we've had an internal
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze since about um July um cuz
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
we can do math and um and kind of knew
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
where this was going and I I would
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
rather lose a vacant position than a
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
person it's just less awkward if you
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
know what I'm saying um and Humane but
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
you know we're down and everybody's
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
hurting and and we're doing a lot so so
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
we feel like I think at some point we
 
01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
refer to ourselves as an already fragile
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
and underst staff department and
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
somebody said do you really want to put
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
the word fragile in your
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
presentation and uh yeah cuz that's
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
literally who we are so we do I'm very
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
proud of the work we do and we do a lot
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
of work and uh I honestly believe if you
 
01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
eliminated our agency government would
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
shut down and be illegal um but anyway
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are so we're down 29
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
and there 25 left on the on pages four
 
01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.390 align:start position:0%
and there 25 left on the on pages four
and

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
five those are
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
they the first page is
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
um unfunded fulltime by source and so
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we quote unquote
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
lost um with an explanation of General
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
funds Etc and then the second page is
 
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
what's still not filled but uh funded in
 
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm happy to answer any
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
questions about that but I don't know
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
exactly where you would like me to go on
 
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
that so I will
 
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
pause there's a there's another page six
 
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
if you get through four and
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
five which is talks about our part-time
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
positions so
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
let's let's talk about just so I make
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the page three um is
 
01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.310 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the page three um is
there

01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
275 people
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
working yeah right now yep is that right
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
okay and didn't check your mouth think
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's 276 276 yeah so there's 276 people
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
here and
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
working yes and um and these these uh 54
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
people or 54 positions nobody's working
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
on them right now right right okay but
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
but if there was no hiring freeze you
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
could add
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
25 and and the budget went through as is
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes right exactly right but you could
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
not add the other 29 if the budget goes
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
through as is yes yeah okay um one
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
caveat to what I said as a foot at the
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
bottom there's a there's a small unit
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
called the office of Cost Containment
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
which is being eliminated so there are
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
those are four positions that are
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
currently filled with people working in
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
them it's being eliminated Cost
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
Containment people we collect people got
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
provided uh a free lawyer so to speak
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
and but we collect from some of them
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
over an enormous amount of time and over
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
time the amount we collect has gone
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
steadily down
 
01:17:58.629 --> 01:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
and so we're we're about to spend more
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
collecting than we collect and that
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
seems like a good so I wanted to ask you
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
about this because we have a house bill
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 611 which does exactly this
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
right and I I guess it must be already
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
in house bill to right no to get rid so
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
we're in we we're just frankly
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
anticipating that house bill 611 611 is
 
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
going to Cassie and I went over
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
testified for it well not for it we
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't testify for against any without
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
permission of chief executive we
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
provided information and suggested a
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
couple of changes just to make it happen
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
faster okay my point is the the fiscal
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
note on House Bill 611 was intriguing
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
because it said due to previous
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
legislative changes the amount collected
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
declining right well so that implies
 
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
that we could undo previous legislative
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
changes and the amount collected would
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
increase yes right do you know what
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
those changes are I can I can summarize
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
them um in I believe it's 2019 I think
 
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
was Senator um belus who pushed this or
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
sponsored it
 
01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
um so we collect we collected from
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
everyone in the past and they changed it
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
to only people
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
convicted so if you if you got off or
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
you pled or um then you don't have to
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
pay and and I think the sponsor's
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
presumption was and I we don't have an
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
opinion about do that or don't do that
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
um we merely pointed out the reduction
 
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
was um well if you were found not guilty
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
why are we charging you and and that's
 
01:19:41.629 --> 01:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
what that's what they tend to say I
 
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
believe the sponsor of the current bill
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
is a law professor at you at yeah
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
Franklin and that 2019 change um
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
required the court to make an order of
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
the defendant's ability to pay and so if
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
you think about most defendants and what
 
01:19:58.510 --> 01:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
their ability to pay is that also
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
seriously ctail to
 
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
collections but somehow in the past well
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
eventually their situation can change
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
and you know right I think I think the
 
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
the presumption had
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
been you don't you can't afford now this
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
week but um when you are working you
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
could pay a little gotcha all right well
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is something we're going to
 
01:20:24.189 --> 01:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
struggle with but let's go on Mr I had
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
to look this up I didn't know what HB
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
611 was so the title is abolishing
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
recruitment procedures regarding
 
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
appointed Council for Indigent criminal
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
defendants just so I don't know what if
 
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
the other members knew what it was yeah
 
01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
that's the office of Coss containment
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah well I didn't well I didn't know
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
that it's it's people who get um um a
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
courta appointed attorney right and that
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
attorney costs something and it's really
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
um if they have the ability to pay they
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
should return that money but that's the
 
01:20:59.470 --> 01:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
idea anyway okay I I don't just so so
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
you're aware before the change the
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
approximate amount we collected ballpark
 
01:21:07.709 --> 01:21:07.719 align:start position:0%
was about 2 million and well this year
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
we will probably collect about 300,000 I
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
don't and the office is the 300,000 dis
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
cost right yeah um so it's on the edge
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
right but it's yeah but it used to be a
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
significant increase yeah so I mean
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
eight years ago I looked at this in a in
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
a different context when I
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
was I was the governor's budget director
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
and we looked at it and I said so what
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
do you spend how much you raise and and
 
01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
leaving aside I didn't know whether it's
 
01:21:39.149 --> 01:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
a good idea or bad idea someone's like
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
well we spend 500 Grand then and we
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
raised 2.4 million and I'm like oh okay
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
and then we didn't pursue it but you
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
know when the lines cross it's not just
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
bad in Ghostbusters yeah I mean I this
 
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.070 align:start position:0%
bad in Ghostbusters yeah I mean I this
is

01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
well let's sa that we we have limited
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
time here so okay so that's where we are
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
in positions good and then just as as a
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
followup is as Charlie mentioned the the
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
29 that were unfunded and that was in
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
our agency and our governor phase it
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
didn't change between the two phases all
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
that detail is on page four and then
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
once again page five would be all the
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
currently vacant but funded positions
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it's also that's about 25 and then
 
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
you'll notice some are a a combination
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
of Z to 100% generally funded right some
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
as early as a week ago ended up on the
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
list but those positions are not
 
01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
eliminated no neither one of them are
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're unfunded they're just un fund
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay yes our counts so that's a really
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
good point is so when you look at the
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
the 330 yes it doesn't change because
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
there're 301 yes right the dollar
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
dollars are gone although the position
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
counts don't change understand I think
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
the point they're trying to make is just
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
because they're vacant it doesn't mean
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
that they're not needed yes so they want
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
to keep the funding for so they can fill
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
okay um if there aren't other questions
 
01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.070 align:start position:0%
okay um if there aren't other questions
about

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
that and you can see the part-timers on
 
01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.870 align:start position:0%
that and you can see the part-timers on
page

01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
six um we have a lot of part-time people
 
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
in plant and property in particular a
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
lot of the building cleaners um in fact
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
that you might see at the State House
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
even um are part-time positions we've
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
actually had an enormous um
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
success with um there's a there's a
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
significant nepales community in conquer
 
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.669 align:start position:0%
significant nepales community in conquer
and

01:23:32.669 --> 01:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
um uh We've we've recruited really good
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
people from there and we're
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
nice which allows you to recruit their
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
friends too so if you're a good employer
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
that people talk so so we decided that's
 
01:23:50.189 --> 01:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
not just a good human strategy it's also
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
a good recruitment strategy um we
 
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
summarized spending 23 vacant out of 66
 
01:23:59.550 --> 01:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
um there's a churn it's a part-time job
 
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
cleaning and if I'm honest my guess is
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
very few people think of that as their
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
their goal and they move on during
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
during uh during the covid years um or
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call that um state
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
of emergency we had a lot of trouble
 
01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.270 align:start position:0%
of emergency we had a lot of trouble
recruiting

01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
um a Dunkin Donuts was paying more and
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily have to do some of
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
the things that you have to do for us
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
and and there's
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
some a little better vital to the you
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
know I said well they say cleanliness is
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
closest thing to Godliness right so it
 
01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't make the position less vital and
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
important no we sort of it's a thing we
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
can't not clean I mean we don't take
 
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:45.639 align:start position:0%
people's trash out for them but you
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
can't not clean the bathroom and mop the
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
floor I think that I think there are
 
01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
rules about occupying buildings okay if
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
you look at the if you look at our our
 
01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
you look at the if you look at our our
our

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
f um so there are line items and then
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
there are expense categories seven is
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
just a summary but on lines eight pages
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
eight and nine by both Total funds and
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
general funds we wanted to summarize for
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
you the major categories of spending and
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
these These are largely class lines in
 
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
the budget and the change just so you
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
can see in the
 
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
aggregate um where things are in case
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
you wanted uh in the past sometimes the
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
house has wanted summaries of that sort
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
to look at and say all right what's
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
going on here what changed on this um
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know what went up
 
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
here and the comparison is is
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
particularly 26 to 25 adjusted
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
authorized um because that doesn't
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
include Granite place or anything like
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
that um but if you any any questions on
 
01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
any of those lines I'm happy to to talk
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
about let's talk about the big ones
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
software in for this State we manage um
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
as I think you know we manage the
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
state's Erp the state's enterprise
 
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
resource planning planning platform the
 
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
the computer that does the business
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
everything the business of state
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
government HR payroll Finance
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
purchasing everything yeah um pay bills
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
pay people and and do everything else um
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're upgrading it's uh the the major
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
upgrade when we when we purchased it I
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
think they were called Lawson at the
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
2008 yeah um drove Sher away from state
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
government um but she came back um and
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh this is this is the the major upgrade
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're moving to the cloud the new
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
product is called Cloud Suite
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
technically you can't not move to the
 
01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
cloud you can't not upgrade your system
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
or you rely on two 85y old men who both
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
want to move to Florida I think there's
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
some system in state government where
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's literally the case um and um and
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're upgrading it's a lot of work it's
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of stress on on
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
actually basically my whole department
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
um except plant and property
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
who aren't doing implementation they
 
01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
have a different stress but um and the
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
annual licensing fee for that um
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
software is essentially going to go from
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
1 million to 2 million okay and I I want
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
to tell you that I think computers are
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
wonderful and very efficient and
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
expensive us all get out and I feel like
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
like there's a whole bunch of people
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
meeting in Bill Gates's house figuring
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
out how to get money out of the rest of
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
us so what what the commissioner of doit
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
told us was basically that when you're
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
doing stuff by hand and you computerize
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
it then you've get a big savings right
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
but once you're already computerized and
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
you go to the next computer there's no
 
01:27:53.229 --> 01:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
saving and the vendor knows you're over
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
a barrel and so costs are going faster
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
than inflation so I it's a great example
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
like with this we looked at doing a
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
complete reprocurement where we went out
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
to bid and we talked to workday and
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
Oracle and everybody else who bids in
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
that market or upgrading with our
 
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
current vendor who's one of the the big
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
five but um and it's really really
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
really expensive to upgrade with our
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
current vendor vendor and a lot less
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
money than if we went out to Bid And so
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's and and you know so so that is a
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
big thing okay one thing I I'll notice
 
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
is that yesterday when commissioner
 
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
Steph from Dr talked about their change
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
in their Rim software you'll notice that
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
their big increase happened in class 27
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
because they're operating their Rim
 
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
system that operation doit support so it
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
moved from their capital budget into
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
class 27 this is not in class 27 we pay
 
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
in4 directly have to be class 38 but
 
01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
it's our I'm sorry our software line um
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
that we pay because we the sap system so
 
01:28:57.629 --> 01:28:57.639 align:start position:0%
it's in a different spot than than rims
 
01:28:59.070 --> 01:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
but the same concept that it's that
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
operation of the cloud product okay all
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
p oh uh yeah plant and property uh uh
 
01:29:12.109 --> 01:29:12.119 align:start position:0%
contracted services so the way we do
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance in
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
um I I want you to look at the line
 
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
above it if you would together with this
 
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
um because we do some things out of
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
class 103 which would be services so
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
buildings and grounds building and
 
01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
grounds so this is P&amp;P plant and
 
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
property so these are the the contracts
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
elevator contracts fire alarm contracts
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
carpentry contracts all of the contracts
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
that you'll see in the division lines at
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
at plant and property
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
our during the governor's phase agency
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
phase and Governor's phase our Direction
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
was to hit a 4% number for total funds
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
and general funds in that division in
 
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
the Aggregate and to figure out the and
 
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that what we're billing
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
agencies in the aggregate does not go up
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
by more than or goes down by 4% as well
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
and so what we did is is we made changes
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
across the division and in some cases we
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
took if when there's room we then put it
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
in this line and so what happens in in
 
01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
those lines is is some portion of of the
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
line is existing contracts and it might
 
01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
be snow plowing and it might be fire
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
extinguishers it might be like monthly
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
Main contracts and it might be other
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
work contracts and then what's left we
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
use to fix stuff for deferred
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance so so so Donnie parin for
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
for Central facilities for example will
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
have a list of the things he wants to
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
fix and if there's money we fix them and
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
if there's not we don't so it's deferred
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance and yes sorry as Charlie
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the overall for that entire
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
division um did go down 4% so while this
 
01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
specific line um increased overall for
 
01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
the division still went down um 4% and
 
01:31:00.669 --> 01:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
if you notice on the next slide where
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
this is total funds uh the general funds
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
are significantly smaller they're about
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
less than 10% of the pl property budget
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
ends up being General funds um because
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
we uh of the reallocation that goes out
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
to all the agencies in terms of the
 
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
billing now it doesn't mean those
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
agencies are paying General funds yes
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why we didn't keep we have to
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
look out for the other
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
division so our directive when we were
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
working to our agency of Governor St is
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
our overall our department for General
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
funds went down 4% we' supplied or
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
applied that same logic to our planting
 
01:31:33.149 --> 01:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
property so even though it doesn't look
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
like General funds we still decrease
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
that overall budget by that same per we
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
we could probably show you at some point
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
too where
 
01:31:43.629 --> 01:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
um what what the governor's office had
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
wanted from
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
us although to be honest it was my
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
suggestion that they should want it was
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
um to for us to do a spreadsheet and say
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
what are your billing agents genes CU I
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
can't come to you and go we don't have
 
01:31:58.750 --> 01:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
any general funds here because it's
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
because people pay them and it's like
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
you know do is the biggest thing like
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
that right and you know do has I pay do
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
with mostly General funds and same thing
 
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
with plan property the second biggest
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
thing in state government like that and
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
so he said do me a do me a list to go up
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
or down and you must go down by 4% so we
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
did and so we put we put money there and
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
it's it is extra money to do deferred
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance is how we do deferred
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance is we
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
use the money that's not been taken by
 
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
the contract increases for deferred
 
01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.629 align:start position:0%
the contract increases for deferred
maintenance

01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
um having said that I'm going to be
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
honest with you it it means there's some
 
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility there but if you take it
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
something won't get
 
01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
fixed yeah um although the state has a
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
long history of not fixing anything
 
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I I've been trying to figure
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
out where it was appropriate to ask this
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
question so I'm going to ask it now
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're obviously talking a lot to the
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
judicial branch um and I'm trying to
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
interrelationship between
 
01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
Das and the judicial branch and I found
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
on your little H your hand out here I
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
found page 15 I don't know if that's the
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
territory yep but it's at the very
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
bottom so you just well because they're
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
talking about the situation with perhaps
 
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
closing cour houses and and if you could
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
help us with that I'd appreciate it so
 
01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
um 15 and and the spreadsheet is on 16
 
01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
um there was a time when the courts took
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
care of their own buildings I want to
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
say the 90s but don't hold me to that
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
and it went back and forth a little bit
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then at some point they decided I
 
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
think we're
 
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
judges we're not as good at taking care
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
of buildings so we take that we have a a
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
bureau called The Bureau of Court
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
facilities that spends more than $10
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
million and we take care of all the cour
 
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
houses across State and we when we
 
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
arrange all the leases for the cour
 
01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
houses across the state and we do work
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
in all the cour houses across the state
 
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
so when I tell you we we do 92 or 95
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
buildings Statewide it includes all the
 
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
cour houses as well and that's a big
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
chunk so that part of our budget is done
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
in concert with them so for example
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
Sarah linbury is the administrator there
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
who works for K raki and um and I said
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
to Sarah and Karen um so here's your
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
target your target is 4%
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
um but that's not Sarah's Target it's
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the Chief Justice says and if
 
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
if they because the branch would get its
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
own Target and and I know that's a
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
little weird in the in a relationship
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
but um if they decide we want to cut 20%
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
out of
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
Maintenance and 4% out of everything
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
else they can and so we we maintain
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
buildings in the in the manner in which
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
they're willing to fund so the numbers
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
that we see here are more coming from
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
them well well they set sort of what
 
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
they want to do they I mean what happens
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
is is we have actually a wonderful
 
01:35:06.109 --> 01:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
working relationship with them where
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
where they trust Sarah implicitly and
 
01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
say well what is this cost and what does
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
that cost there are actually quarterly
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
meetings at the I served on that yeah
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
the court accreditation why I know Sarah
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and so and and you know that she's
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
very knows what she's doing and uh so
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
we'll work with them and they'll say
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
well what about this well what happens
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
if I do this so this is a back and forth
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it's typically Sarah meeting with
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
Diane Martin the budget that's here
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
represents where it left really the
 
01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:35.590 align:start position:0%
represents where it left really the
agency

01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
phase um these numbers support where the
 
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
judicial branch was at the end of their
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
agency phase and the reason I say that
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
is the um governor in House Bill 2 made
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
some reductions to the judicial branch
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't make um tweaks to our budget
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
because the digital Branch at the time
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
had it made specific decisions and the
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
legislature hasn't chimed in in terms of
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
do all the C courts operate do half of
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
them operate you know for example if we
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
decrease courts that we lease the rent
 
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
line would come down if we um if they
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
Clos courts that we own then we'd have
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
decreases in our maintenance staff to
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
support those buildings if we're not
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
going to be in them electricity would
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
change depending on the volume of the
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
the number of cours so this is a fluid
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
so after you finish with the branch and
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know that you have
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
um this accounting unit will change
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
based on what you do but the the money
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
for this accounting unit is in their
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
budget as a as a class 28 transfer to us
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
so so when that changes we will adjust
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
all of these numbers to fit in
 
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
particular they told us if we wanted
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
Cuts they would cut um the courthouse in
 
01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:52.360 align:start position:0%
hookit and gtown are those rented or
 
01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.030 align:start position:0%
hookit and gtown are those rented or
leased

01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
leased
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
they're leased okay and are these but
 
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
are we in long-term leases or can we
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
stop as of July 1 generally we can the
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
state generally has language and leases
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
that allow us to um get out when there
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
are no funds that that that's a caveat
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
in those leases okay good well I think
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
though that that's included in their 4%
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
reduction anyway they were choosing
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
between candy and Claremont and they
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
replace Claremont with so it's not like
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
if we have them do that we're going to
 
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
get more cuts understanding is the
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
agency phase included right elimination
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
of cour houses yes so the other question
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
is just what what is the the Personnel
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
lines then within Court facilities what
 
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
are those those aren't the judges so who
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
are no they're M what are they it's the
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance staff okay it's it's
 
01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.550 align:start position:0%
maintenance staff okay it's it's
building

01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
cleaners um construction everybody okay
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
all right we I let me back up so plant
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
and property um is has two parallel
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
components AR arguably and and one is
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
what we call Central facilities which
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
used to be two or three bureaus and and
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
three years ago the then Governor made
 
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
us combine them
 
01:38:14.109 --> 01:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
um but he he let us at the time keep
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
Court facilities a separate Bureau but
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
they all have the same stuff because
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
they they all clean buildings so they
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
have building cleaners they all have
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance tchs because they all
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
maintain buildings and they all I mean
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
on and on and on they don't have people
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
they don't overlap in that for the most
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
part I mean if somebody needs help that
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's a different thing but for the
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
most part people are assigned to a set
 
01:38:37.119 --> 01:38:38.229 align:start position:0%
most part people are assigned to a set
of

01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
buildings right so this line just Mr
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
chair one more thing so I just want to
 
01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:44.679 align:start position:0%
be clear this line that we're looking in
 
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
your budget is the cost of the Court
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
facilities or and their maintenance all
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
of that's what we're looking at it
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
exactly right but it's all transferred
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
from the 100 plus million I get it but
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
it's also living here yeah okay um and
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
when you make changes we'll change it so
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
back to page eight of the presentation
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
yes so then there's um the federal
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
government buying
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
lunch so what is that um there's a
 
01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
program called Surplus foods and it's
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
run out of the warehouse on St Street it
 
01:39:26.189 --> 01:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
was at one time years ago called the New
 
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Distributing agency but the
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
federal government distributes food to
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of to all states who then
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
distribute food to in our case mostly
 
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
schools a little bit of food banks but
 
01:39:38.109 --> 01:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
mostly schools and there's an
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
arrangement with the schools it is
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
federally funded um with a $155,000
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
state match which is a decent return on
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
a million dollar program um and it's uh
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's going up because of the the
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
school districts pay a per case charge
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
for the food that they get and that per
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
case charge has changed and it it goes
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
up and down when the
 
01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
federal um um allotment to the state
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
goes up and down and so it recently went
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
up which is why you which is why you see
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
that interesting but it's all federal
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
funds gotta okay page
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
nine oh this is General same thing same
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
thing in general funds okay and you'll
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
notice there's not really any different
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
categories that pop out we haven't
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
already talked about so there's um but
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
well there's rents I guess yeah and I
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
can talk so the rents on this page are
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
fairly fairly small I will make one
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
comment that on page eight the rent line
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
um went down so if you go back to page
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
eight I did want to point this out so
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
rents other than leas is 4.5 73 almost
 
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:49.719 align:start position:0%
4.6 million went down to 38 some of that
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
decrease now obviously some rents go up
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
some rents go down but we had by
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing Granite place that used to be
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
a lease for us and then we have since
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
purchased it so the budget for 2425
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
reflected um still leasing that so some
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
of these costs have been reflected in 26
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
27 with uh that one specific building
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
changing and so retiree Health this
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
overall 6% increase over the bium I mean
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
this just normal increase in health
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
costs right I mean yeah so yeah we
 
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
avoided the normal increase in health
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
cost for a while with with very
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
aggressive procurement strategies but um
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
we used to always say the fisal to
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
aren't any more rabbits in the Hat and
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
so um I I will say this it's important
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's important to know that that we're
 
01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be good at
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
predicting well where 2027 is a
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
significant portion of healthcare costs
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
are dictated by federal policy and
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursements and I I don't
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
think anyone
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
has a really strong sense
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
today on what exactly is going on in
 
01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.390 align:start position:0%
today on what exactly is going on in
Washington

01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
DC okay page 10 this oh yes sorry
 
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
represent LE thanks Mr chairman so it's
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
just curious of the number of retirees
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
on the St retiree Health
 
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
Plan I can have I can provide that for
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
you um we have
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
10,906 Medicare retirees and we we also
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
have retirees who aren't eligible for
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
for Medicare early retirees
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
1580 and then when further question some
 
01:42:35.589 --> 01:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
time ago we talked about a small
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
contribution that they would pay in uh
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
what are they paying in now as because I
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
know the state doesn't pay 100% of it
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
but right non-medicare retirees pay 20%
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
of the monthly premium it's um let me
 
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
see if I have the figure here uh they
 
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
are paying
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
one no the pre
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
167 yeah that sounds right right um and
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
per month and I feel like that's not
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
right so let me let me just verify that
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
um when we had the budget trouble with
 
01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
retire Health back in fiscal 16 and 17
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
and when Charlie was working for the
 
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
governor as the budget officer that was
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
the first time we implemented a pre
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
premium contribution for our Medicare
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
retirees and they pay 10% of the premium
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
and you may remember I mentioned when we
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
were last here in late January that we
 
01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
worked with rep obber at the time and we
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
grandfathered um the oldest retirees who
 
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
had the lowest pensions and so um what
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
what obviously happens is um new people
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
come into the plan and then people also
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
um pass away so we are down to
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
4759 retirees who are Medicare retirees
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
grandfathered okay um one other thing a
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
smaller number it is a smaller the one
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
thing I want to mention to you so that
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know this too is um over over I
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
think since 2009 the state has been
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
trying to um limit who gets through the
 
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
door to be eligible for retire health
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why you hear their age limits
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
and and years of service limits right um
 
01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things the state did back in
 
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
the around the 2010 time frame was we
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
used to pay for the Medicare Part B
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
premium for the Medicare retirees we
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't pay that and they now pay that
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
that's what the 167 is is the Medicare
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
Part thanks thanks Mr chairman
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
so so are you saying that 6,000 or so
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
paid 10% yes yes okay and and uh 40
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
4,800 pay nothing correct right okay and
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
then quite old and 1600 pay
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
20% is that kind of yeah yes okay
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
exactly right the 1600 who pay
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
20% um it's also a much more more
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
expensive benefit the the 10% of the of
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
the Medicare benefit is quite small oh
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
less than $80
 
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
H it's not $80 it's not half of the
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
167 no it's 10% of 167 so it's 16 right
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
the Medicare premium the non-medicare
 
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
premium is
 
01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
$1,478 and and you might say why is it
 
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
so high compared to the Medicare premium
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
right it's because not Medicare eligible
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
there are no federal funds coming in to
 
01:45:49.229 --> 01:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
pay for part of their healthare yeah I
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
mean that's what I pay right so yes yes
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
exactly so okay
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
and so you're saying the 6,000 people
 
01:45:59.310 --> 01:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
are paying like $20 or something yes I
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
see okay go we get them on one pager on
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
who pays um that was a big change for
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
those retirees um back in
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
2017 there was it it took a lot to get
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
there okay do
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
you is it easy to collect I mean is it
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
sort of automatic or do they have
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
everybody writing a check or is it uh
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
well writing a check is not easy okay
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
because people don't and then when you
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
do you have to H process them right it
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
used to be easier to collect because of
 
01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
the retirement um New Hampshire
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system um and it's a
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
complicated story and I if you want I
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
think we talk about it on the side but
 
01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
essentially they stopped collecting from
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
certain retirees and we had to hire a
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
billing service to help us collect so um
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's not easy to collect
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we need to talk to them about
 
01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.910 align:start position:0%
okay so we need to talk to them about
that

01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
system we should have a longer
 
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
conversation about that okay all right
 
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
we'll make a note to that there are two
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
sides to every
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
story our side tends to be angrier so
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
Melissa Melissa you want to make a note
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
about this yeah to to remind me to do
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
that y we can do that okay okay um good
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the next page page
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
10 so one of the things you one of the
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
things you had said you wanted to talk
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
about is um programs and obviously we do
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
very few programmatic things but there's
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
a rumor that you have an interest in
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
Paid Family Leave I stole your sheet oh
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's mine yeah okay so Cassie is going
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
to talk about Paid Family Leave because
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
it took 10 years off her
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
life it it really did and um my life may
 
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.390 align:start position:0%
life it it really did and um my life may
expire

01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
expire
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
um so I talked about this when we were
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
last here um paid family medical leave
 
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
was passed in House Bill 2 of 2021 um we
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
implemented it over a period of a year
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
and a half and we first offered retire
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
um paid family medical leave for sale in
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
December of 23 the structure of the
 
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
program I think is a good place to start
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
because it probably will lay out your
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
questions for you right so under the law
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
that was passed there's a purpose
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
section in that law that says that we we
 
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
we the state of New Hampshire desire to
 
01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
create a a advantageous market for paid
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
family medical leave and in order to
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
accomplish that we're going to provide a
 
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
um Paid Family Leave benefit to all
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
state employees that will which is
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 8900 people okay and that
 
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
creates um the the incentive for a
 
01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
vendor a carrier to come into our state
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
and then administer the paid family
 
01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
medical leave on a voluntary basis so
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
what that means is that um Employers in
 
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire can decide if
 
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
they want to purchase paid family
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
medical leave for their um employees
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
they decide um whether they want base
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
coverage or they want to buy up coverage
 
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
and and you know my slides cover what
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
the base coverage is and um they also
 
01:49:37.149 --> 01:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
can decide whether their their employees
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
contribute to the
 
01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.550 align:start position:0%
contribute to the
cost

01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
um there because the program is
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
voluntary for employers I I if I'm an
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
employer I don't have to buy it and I
 
01:49:52.109 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay for the whole thing
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
there are going going to be some
 
01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
employees in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
who will not have access to paid family
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
medical leave so the other unique thing
 
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
about our law is it set up something
 
01:50:06.589 --> 01:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
called an individual plan so that if an
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
employee worked for an employer who did
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
not pro purchase paid family medical
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
leave or through its own benefit
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
structure have comparable benefits
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
available an individual can go to this
 
01:50:21.629 --> 01:50:21.639 align:start position:0%
individual group through MetLife our
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
contractor and purchase paid family
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
medical leave on their own um there is
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
an annual open enrollment for that um
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
individual plan and this is our third o
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
Open Enrollment and we now have 1,800
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
people who have applied to for coverage
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh under the as individuals yes um so
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
what do we pay for what does the state
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
pay for we pay for the state employee
 
01:50:52.159 --> 01:50:53.470 align:start position:0%
pay for we pay for the state employee
benefit

01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
that is uh I on the slide on page 10 I
 
01:50:59.790 --> 01:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
you see the total funds for fiscal 24
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
was 1.4 52 million where do you find
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
that you find that it's spread out in
 
01:51:08.109 --> 01:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
every Department's budget in the class
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
60 associated with employees it's just a
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
minor piece and the rate is very
 
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable Sher can you save it for me
 
01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.830 align:start position:0%
reasonable Sher can you save it for me
it's

01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
207% of cover will
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
be like 1 of 1% the second second
 
01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.550 align:start position:0%
be like 1 of 1% the second second
207%

01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
207%
 
01:51:37.229 --> 01:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
027 and what what fraction of these 8900
 
01:51:39.229 --> 01:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
state employees make
 
01:51:39.239 --> 01:51:40.750 align:start position:0%
state employees make
claims

01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
claims
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
um well it's relatively new so um minor
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
I did send you folks the information
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
with the claims data I I don't have it
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
at my fingertips I'm sorry but but um I
 
01:51:54.069 --> 01:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
I'll say it was about a 100 people who
 
01:51:56.669 --> 01:51:56.679 align:start position:0%
have made claims in the last year or so
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay can I yes I just want to add
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
something so the point 207 works out the
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 was about 1.4
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
million and and just as a note it's
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
about 550 Grand in general funds
 
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide because if if you if you think
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
about our our employee benefits are you
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
want a ballpark things about 40% General
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
funds 40% non or 60% non-general funds
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
so so so that the state the the the cost
 
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
of the coverage for the state employees
 
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
is is the contractual monetary basis for
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
our contract with metti okay um and then
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
they provide the voluntary program to
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
employers and to
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
individuals when does that contract end
 
01:52:47.709 --> 01:52:47.719 align:start position:0%
that contract ends I put it someplace
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and we we have other contracts
 
01:53:03.310 --> 01:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
so so 12 3127 and it has an option to
 
01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
extend for two additional years so we
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
can't change that in this B budget is
 
01:53:09.629 --> 01:53:09.639 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying no I'm not
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
saying that um I I think it's important
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
that you know that that's what the
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
contract is okay um and what and how we
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
fund that contract is through the state
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
employee premium so and I I'm operating
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
on assumptions I spoke to Rich labors
 
01:53:29.709 --> 01:53:29.719 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner over at nhes who was
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
here last week um
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
so if the desire is to look at
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
eliminating paid family medical leave
 
01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
um this accounting unit information that
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
you have supports uh Consulting contract
 
01:53:50.669 --> 01:53:50.679 align:start position:0%
supports a marketing contract and
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
supports a very minor contract with a
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
company called silvertech from
 
01:53:59.470 --> 01:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester that um has produced uh we
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
we've provided all the content but our
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
beautiful website that I told you about
 
01:54:09.390 --> 01:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
um and um so if if you desire to to
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate the expense for paid family
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
medical leave um if you cut the state
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
employee benefit I know that you folks
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
asked Rich what do you think will happen
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
and he said talk to the AG's office well
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
I'll give you my personal opinion and
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
that's all it is and for what it's worth
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
it will be the death now for Paid Family
 
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
Medical Le because it is through the
 
01:54:36.030 --> 01:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
state employee benefit that the that
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
metti makes a profit of course okay so
 
01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
um I think if that profit is eliminated
 
01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
at best you see them remain and be
 
01:54:45.159 --> 01:54:46.830 align:start position:0%
at best you see them remain and be
passive

01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
passive
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
um but at worst they say okay then we're
 
01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
we're out of this contract right
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:58.750 align:start position:0%
um the
law

01:54:58.750 --> 01:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
required Das and nhes to provide
 
01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
marketing and Outreach for paid family
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
medical leave um there is a bill to
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
repeal paid family medical leave it is
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
517 um when I get back to my office
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
today for what it's worth I will be
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
sending an amendment to Chairman hunt as
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
he requested to um eliminate the
 
01:55:31.229 --> 01:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
marketing responsibilities for dis and
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
nhes um and but but
 
01:55:38.069 --> 01:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise um not repeal Paid Family
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
Medical so there are different ways you
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
can look at if you're interested in
 
01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
doing something with this program what
 
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
do you do I think if you eliminate the
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
state employee benefit my personal
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
opinion is the whole thing will die if
 
01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
you might decide to to gut the Das
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
operational budget for it so but you
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
said that the contract goes through 2027
 
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
correct so met life's contract yeah
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
right so but I could end it July 1st
 
01:56:14.589 --> 01:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
2026 or not um I think if you decided to
 
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate the state employee benefit I
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
would go back to Matti and say this is
 
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
what it's looking like okay and I and I
 
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
believe they would say to us well that's
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
the whole basis for the contract where
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
we want to terminate the contract and I
 
01:56:33.229 --> 01:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
don't think the state would have much of
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
a legal leg to stand on to say you can't
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
do that since it's what we pay them well
 
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we would want them to do no
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
that if that's what you direct yeah yeah
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
I understand okay I I guess I anyways
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
represent one now the other the other
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
point just to so the the state spend as
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to the me life spend um it's the
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
1.4 million that's scattered throughout
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
the budget which is 550 in general funds
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
and then we can we can talk in a minute
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
but the other expenses are all in this
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
accounting unit right we eliminated the
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
position so that's not there and and the
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
small silvertech contract and then two
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
other contracts which we we could save
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
little bits here and there yeah yeah now
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
let me ask you there's one number we
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
don't have you have in this program
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's 8,900 state employees there's
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
1,800 uh private employees who get
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
individuals so what about companies that
 
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
buy it for their whole staff um so I
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
have some updated numbers let me find
 
01:57:39.790 --> 01:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
them I'm sorry little bit and are they
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
also paying 0.2% of payroll for those
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
people is everybody paying so so let me
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
pause because I didn't go into that
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
detail pardon me first of all start on
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
the individual side because it's easy to
 
01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
understand the law caps the individual
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
pool premium at $5 a week the goal is
 
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
stated in the law is to have reasonable
 
01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
rates okay so if you're Met Life you're
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
under that pressure anyway every person
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
in the individual pool is individually
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
rated so they're going to look at my age
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
um they're going to look at um am I in
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
childbearing age you know like they're
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to rate me um the same occurs for
 
01:58:27.310 --> 01:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
an employer when an employer says to
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
metti I would like a quote they provide
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
a census of their employees where
 
01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to look at male female
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
demographics Etc and they're also going
 
01:58:39.629 --> 01:58:39.639 align:start position:0%
to look at what other benefits do you
 
01:58:42.189 --> 01:58:42.199 align:start position:0%
provide to your employees because
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
they're what they're trying to answer is
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
if an employee has a a need to access a
 
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
benefit how soon are they going to
 
01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
access mine underp Paid Family Leave
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
right so every employer is individually
 
01:58:57.229 --> 01:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
rated too
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay so so you asked me what was the
 
01:59:04.350 --> 01:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
employer enrollment yes so um but but
 
01:59:07.470 --> 01:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
it's the state is paying roughly this $5
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
a week also a little less it looks like
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
yes less $4 a week or something depends
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
on how much you
 
01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
make okay but but on average for these
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
8,900 people yeah okay go ahead so tell
 
01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
me the before I get to represent wer
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
Tell me number um we have now
 
01:59:30.270 --> 01:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
308 employers who have purchased
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
coverage for their
 
01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
workers um now remember I mentioned a
 
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
one employer might pay for it 100% right
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
but if I say to my employees you pay you
 
01:59:46.750 --> 01:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
pay 50% you pay 20% Then I'm going to
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
decide as an employee do I want to py
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
this right so so um those those
 
01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
employers today um let's see uh we have
 
01:59:59.709 --> 01:59:59.719 align:start position:0%
20 so there there's how many people have
 
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
access to the coverage
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
23,600 people actually covered by
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
13,37 great all right repres
 
02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:13.229 align:start position:0%
13,37 great all right repres
representative

02:00:13.229 --> 02:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
wer why are we hearing this figure of$
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
million that this would save the state
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
if it was cancelled it only seems like
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
it would save a million and a
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
half um I don't know why you're hearing
 
02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
10 million representative wer but it is
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
the million and a half for the state
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
employee benefit plus the operational
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
expenses that are on this slide I list
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
my slide but if you got rid of the
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
marketing that saves a have 400 million
 
02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:40.310 align:start position:0%
marketing that saves a have 400 million
if

02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
you a thousand but if you so if you got
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
let's just say for the sake of argument
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm not recommending this
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
that you got rid of the entire program
 
02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
you just said U this accounting unit
 
02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
gone and and we're eliminating the state
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
employee benefit you'd save about 550
 
02:00:59.950 --> 02:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
General funds on the benefit and you
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
could theoretically reduce uh we have
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
700 Grand in for the accounting unit so
 
02:01:07.069 --> 02:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
you would save in terms of General funds
 
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
about ballpark 1.2 million I it's
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
possible that somebody per year per year
 
02:01:16.950 --> 02:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
somebody got the wrong end of the stick
 
02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
and told you 10 million and maybe they
 
02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
missed a decimal point and I also
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
remember who told you that so I can't
 
02:01:25.149 --> 02:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
say I don't know I just saw it somewhere
 
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
but also that I saw somewhere you had to
 
02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
be paying in for 17 months before you
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
could exercise this okay um what you're
 
02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
referencing is applies to the individual
 
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
plan and it's actually in the law it
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
there is a seven Monon waiting period
 
02:01:45.390 --> 02:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
before you can file a claim that will be
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed and accepted and um the waiting
 
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
period I I remember working with the
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance at the time and
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner described it as a
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
deductible it's a one-time 7mon waiting
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
period so if I purchase January 1 I have
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
to wait seven months to have a claim but
 
02:02:07.629 --> 02:02:07.639 align:start position:0%
if I stay in next year and the and the
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
and the following years I never have
 
02:02:12.669 --> 02:02:12.679 align:start position:0%
another waiting period there is
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
something called an elimination period
 
02:02:18.109 --> 02:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
which is common in Insurance um uh you
 
02:02:21.629 --> 02:02:21.639 align:start position:0%
know coverage and and that is a one we
 
02:02:21.639 --> 02:02:22.390 align:start position:0%
know coverage and and that is a one we
um

02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
waiting period and that the goal of that
 
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
is is there a real claim here is it not
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
just I have to go to a doctor's
 
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
appointment you know another thing I
 
02:02:33.629 --> 02:02:33.639 align:start position:0%
read is that the the private uh
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
purchases are mostly women in the uh
 
02:02:40.510 --> 02:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
childbearing age um that that that is um
 
02:02:42.990 --> 02:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the claims experience is for
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
bonding with children um and
 
02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
um I think that's important for you to
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
understand um what what would be the
 
02:02:56.350 --> 02:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
consequence if if it were unfunded and
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
the and the program basically ends now
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
for the 100 people roughly of state
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
employees who receive
 
02:03:07.229 --> 02:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
benefits do you know how much in total
 
02:03:09.790 --> 02:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
benefits they
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
got um they get what anyone gets which
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
is the base coverage 60% of their base
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
wages up to the social security cap for
 
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
up to six weeks yeah but I want this in
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
terms of dollarss per year total I can
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
get you that information okay like how
 
02:03:29.790 --> 02:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
much did meti pay how much did meti pay
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
out in benefits to those to those hund I
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
mean presumably it's less than the 1.42
 
02:03:39.629 --> 02:03:39.639 align:start position:0%
million it most certainly
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
is yeah but is it is it 80% of it is it
 
02:03:47.549 --> 02:03:47.559 align:start position:0%
10% of it it's going to be a low
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
percentage oh I see okay okay great it's
 
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
not the big savings that somebody has
 
02:03:55.629 --> 02:03:55.639 align:start position:0%
told no it is not it's not a huge amount
 
02:03:59.069 --> 02:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
of savings and um the re there there's
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
some there's one more thing I'd like you
 
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
to know so when I talk to community
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
groups because it's our statutory
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
obligation about paid family medical
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
leave one of the things we talk about is
 
02:04:11.709 --> 02:04:11.719 align:start position:0%
that paid family medical leave is being
 
02:04:13.709 --> 02:04:13.719 align:start position:0%
debated across the country in every
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
single state and at the federal level as
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
well and there there is a federal
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan working group that has
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
recently come out with recommendations
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire model is one of
 
02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
those recommendations the beauty of the
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire model is that it's really
 
02:04:34.750 --> 02:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
very lean you're you're transferring the
 
02:04:37.149 --> 02:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
the administration of the program to the
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier uh the first time I
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
sat in on a a bipartisan working group
 
02:04:46.030 --> 02:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
call uh I was there there were States
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
like Colorado and Washington present and
 
02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
they conduct the administration of their
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
plan so um rich labers and I and our two
 
02:04:58.830 --> 02:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
two other staff people that was the New
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire working group right uh would
 
02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
listen to Colorado talk about how they
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
hired a 100 people right so if you're
 
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to do this and you think it's
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
important I think this is the way to do
 
02:05:13.709 --> 02:05:13.719 align:start position:0%
it you know it's very it's very very
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
lean and I will say with a lot of Pride
 
02:05:19.069 --> 02:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
we did a good job to help educate the
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
public okay but let's oose that the
 
02:05:24.549 --> 02:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
let's just talk about the state
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
employees let's suppose that of those
 
02:05:29.950 --> 02:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
8,900 state employees the 100 who get
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
the benefit only get $500,000 worth of
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
benefit or something like
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
that can we get rid of MetLife and all
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
the external people Al together and give
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
those 100 employees who qualify the
 
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
$500,000 of
 
02:05:53.069 --> 02:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
benefit do you see what I mean and and
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
and only pay that well directly I mean
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
if you're interested in the program
 
02:05:59.229 --> 02:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
continue and I don't want to argue with
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
you I'm I'm just trying to explain so if
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
let me know um if you're interested in
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
the program continuing to be available
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the public right um then I believe
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
that the state employee premium that we
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
pay metti is the key to Met Life
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:27.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:06:27.790 --> 02:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
02:06:32.830 --> 02:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
Insurance any insurance you're paying
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
something for every person who's I call
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
it a member right and then only member
 
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
only certain numbers of members make a
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
claim right so so I don't personally
 
02:06:48.030 --> 02:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
feel it's about the state employees who
 
02:06:51.149 --> 02:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
have accessed the coverage and been paid
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's about the real issue is the
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
structure of the law that says you're
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
going to provide this benefit to State
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
Employees to create a market to
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
incentivize a carrier to come into New
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and operate this voluntary
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
plan right but
 
02:07:12.669 --> 02:07:12.679 align:start position:0%
I that's not my question but no I'll
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
just note this you yes you could if we
 
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
if we're interested in making sure 8,900
 
02:07:19.229 --> 02:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
state employees have access to this
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
particular benefit you could cut a check
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
for access to that benefit and if if
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's the goal the the program with a
 
02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
little bit of administrative overhead
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
presumably but not probably because we'd
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
have to um but it it's worth noting that
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
if that's the goal yeah absolutely easy
 
02:07:40.830 --> 02:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
peasy okay um the program wasn't set up
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
to do that I understand program program
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
was set up as an alternative to a state
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
paid leave program to a to a a state
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
funded paid leave program and it was to
 
02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
create a private market and the employee
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
benefit is not there for the state
 
02:07:56.910 --> 02:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
employees it's there to create a market
 
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
so somebody would bid right but it's
 
02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
only 15 right now thousand people that
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
are getting no it's not you don't know
 
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be in that business
 
02:08:08.189 --> 02:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
right not s insurance I'm not
 
02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
disagreeing I mean you're absolutely
 
02:08:11.069 --> 02:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
right and you could absolutely do that
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
all right now we're way beyond our time
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to have to ask you
 
02:08:16.589 --> 02:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
back at some other point we would love
 
02:08:18.189 --> 02:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
to come back maybe for only a half an
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
hour or something like that but we'll
 
02:08:22.510 --> 02:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
work it out with Melissa so okay can I
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
just ask some like super easy how much
 
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
money do you save if you get rid of the
 
02:08:30.189 --> 02:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
marketing requirement the way marketing
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
is is it just how much money we a lot of
 
02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
money marketing is in class 102 there's
 
02:08:39.229 --> 02:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit of it's the very last line
 
02:08:42.910 --> 02:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
on my slide 10 marketing is to 250 250
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
250 and the consultant is
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
450 spring which is a benefit all right
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
gotcha so it is the bulk of this yeah it
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
is actually so the Outreach is a lot of
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%

e

03:11:16.229 --> 03:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:16.239 --> 03:11:46.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:46.239 --> 03:12:16.150 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:12:16.150 --> 03:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:46.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:12:46.110 --> 03:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:46.120 --> 03:13:16.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:13:16.110 --> 03:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:16.120 --> 03:13:46.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:13:46.030 --> 03:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:46.040 --> 03:14:16.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:14:16.030 --> 03:14:16.040 align:start position:0%

03:15:39.910 --> 03:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so actually um I think we're going
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:54.110 --> 03:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:54.120 --> 03:15:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
general

03:15:57.670 --> 03:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:00.870 --> 03:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr Mr chairman members
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh John formela
 
03:16:05.309 --> 03:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
attorney general and with me is Kathy
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
Carr our director of
 
03:16:09.389 --> 03:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
administration did you want us to go
 
03:16:10.750 --> 03:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
through our presentation or are you just
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
going to jump right in and ask us about
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
various lines and things yeah let's
 
03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
let's go to any page that has numbers on
 
03:16:22.590 --> 03:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
it maybe like
 
03:16:26.189 --> 03:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
um so let me just let me give you a
 
03:16:31.469 --> 03:16:31.479 align:start position:0%
little preview of where we're at um
 
03:16:31.479 --> 03:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
little preview of where we're at um
so

03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:33.120 --> 03:16:34.630 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:37.469 --> 03:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
basically the governor was really
 
03:16:40.269 --> 03:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
optimistic as far as revenues go from
 
03:16:43.030 --> 03:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
our point of view and so we're going to
 
03:16:46.910 --> 03:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
have to cut things and um one one me
 
03:16:48.070 --> 03:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
measure we're
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
using in of um what's sort of the right
 
03:16:55.710 --> 03:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
size of things or at least part of the
 
03:17:00.389 --> 03:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
input to our process is um what was in
 
03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 2019 budget compared to
 
03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
today so
 
03:17:11.790 --> 03:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
um because 2019 was was sort of
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
preco and it's it's a good six years and
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
so on and since then
 
03:17:20.429 --> 03:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
um there's been like 25% inflation plus
 
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
4% population growth so you could say
 
03:17:25.630 --> 03:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
well kind of a medium sort of number for
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
an increase over 2019 would be 30% maybe
 
03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
something like that well um in terms of
 
03:17:33.920 --> 03:17:35.150 align:start position:0%
something like that well um in terms of
General

03:17:35.150 --> 03:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
General
 
03:17:38.830 --> 03:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
funds um let's see where you guys are
 
03:17:38.840 --> 03:17:40.309 align:start position:0%
funds um let's see where you guys are
you

03:17:40.309 --> 03:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:17:40.319 --> 03:17:42.630 align:start position:0%
you
guys

03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
guys
 
03:17:46.349 --> 03:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
are I'm not seeing oh there it is yeah
 
03:17:46.359 --> 03:17:47.990 align:start position:0%
are I'm not seeing oh there it is yeah
so

03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
so you guys have are really have an
 
03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
increase a serious increase I mean the
 
03:17:57.910 --> 03:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
the um just from 2019 to
 
03:18:00.830 --> 03:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
2025 um
 
03:18:05.229 --> 03:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
104% so of worth of General funds and in
 
03:18:09.389 --> 03:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
all funds only 37% so so the amount of
 
03:18:11.229 --> 03:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
General funds your department is
 
03:18:15.630 --> 03:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
consuming it is in first blush very very
 
03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
high and so um we may have to uh make
 
03:18:23.830 --> 03:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
more severe Cuts here than than in other
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
places so um what I'm interested in is
 
03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
these kind of numbers like you have here
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
on page three with you know how many
 
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
cases you're dealing with and all that
 
03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
sort of thing how many calls how many um
 
03:18:42.150 --> 03:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
and and whatever you can say
 
03:18:45.229 --> 03:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
about how do you measure productivity
 
03:18:46.790 --> 03:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
because all your all of your EXP
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
expenses our attorneys and staff and
 
03:18:52.830 --> 03:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
people right and and so how do you
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
measure um
 
03:18:57.790 --> 03:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
productivity and how do you think
 
03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
of you know so much per case so much per
 
03:19:03.790 --> 03:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
you know so many cases per person or
 
03:19:06.110 --> 03:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
something like that or is it or is it so
 
03:19:08.189 --> 03:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
many court cases you know I mean you
 
03:19:10.110 --> 03:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
probably have a difference
 
03:19:12.750 --> 03:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
between criminal cases and non-criminal
 
03:19:14.870 --> 03:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
cases and you know whether something
 
03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
gets settled or goes to court and things
 
03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
like that but but I just
 
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
wondering how do we see whether how do
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
you think of the different departments
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
and whether they're performing well not
 
03:19:26.399 --> 03:19:29.189 align:start position:0%
and whether they're performing well not
performing

03:19:29.189 --> 03:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:31.950 --> 03:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
well yeah that's
 
03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
a uh good question so let me so there
 
03:19:38.229 --> 03:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
there's a few different ways we we
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
measure performance of the Department of
 
03:19:42.429 --> 03:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
Justice right so
 
03:19:45.630 --> 03:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
the the first and foremost I would say
 
03:19:47.429 --> 03:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
is that every agent and the Department
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
of Justice is no exception is only as
 
03:19:53.229 --> 03:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
good as its people so we we look to you
 
03:19:54.910 --> 03:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
know measure the performance and growth
 
03:19:56.309 --> 03:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
of our individual employees whether
 
03:19:57.670 --> 03:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's at whether they're attorneys
 
03:20:00.269 --> 03:20:00.279 align:start position:0%
paralegals legal support staff so every
 
03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
employee is evaluated on on a regular
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
basis so that that's I think that's the
 
03:20:06.910 --> 03:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
first what I would say first is
 
03:20:10.630 --> 03:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
evaluations that are done for for
 
03:20:14.510 --> 03:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
each employee we also look at just hours
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
that people are putting in per week the
 
03:20:19.030 --> 03:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
legal profession especially is one that
 
03:20:21.309 --> 03:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
often is you know we we measure you know
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
hours people are spending on on cases
 
03:20:25.710 --> 03:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
hours of attorney time in the private
 
03:20:27.710 --> 03:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
sector hours of attorney time is how you
 
03:20:29.309 --> 03:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
measure sort of Revenue that you're
 
03:20:31.309 --> 03:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
bringing in if if you're if you're a law
 
03:20:35.110 --> 03:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
firm so we we measure that we try to
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on you know the number of
 
03:20:39.229 --> 03:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
hours an attorney is spending it's just
 
03:20:42.389 --> 03:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's just working per week uh case
 
03:20:45.910 --> 03:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
numbers is a I mean we we we provide
 
03:20:47.550 --> 03:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
these numbers to you in our presentation
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
just so you have a
 
03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
snapshot it's a little difficult I think
 
03:20:53.309 --> 03:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
to measure someone's workload or
 
03:20:55.469 --> 03:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
productivity by the number of quote
 
03:20:57.870 --> 03:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
cases they have because every case is
 
03:20:59.550 --> 03:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
different some cases are very
 
03:21:02.070 --> 03:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
complicated and take a lot of time some
 
03:21:05.269 --> 03:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
cases are pretty quick and we also sort
 
03:21:08.550 --> 03:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
of we have cases so we think of cases as
 
03:21:10.870 --> 03:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
active litigation matters right either
 
03:21:14.469 --> 03:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
somebody has sued the state and now we
 
03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
are litigating that case or we have
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
opened a
 
03:21:21.670 --> 03:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
investigation and even further down the
 
03:21:23.950 --> 03:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
road have filed criminal charges so now
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
we're Prosecuting a case or we brought
 
03:21:28.429 --> 03:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
an enforcement action so we have cases
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
we also measure in matters the
 
03:21:33.630 --> 03:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
difference between a matter and a case
 
03:21:37.349 --> 03:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
is anytime just an issue has to be
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
worked on or addressed or analyzed we'll
 
03:21:43.150 --> 03:21:43.160 align:start position:0%
often open a separate matter in our
 
03:21:46.750 --> 03:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
system which we it's called praw so so
 
03:21:48.429 --> 03:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
there are cases people have a number of
 
03:21:49.950 --> 03:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
cases they also have a number of open
 
03:21:51.550 --> 03:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
matters they're working on and a matter
 
03:21:54.870 --> 03:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
can evolve into a case or or not but it
 
03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
it still takes work so and then we of
 
03:22:01.110 --> 03:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
course measure and we
 
03:22:05.950 --> 03:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
don't we don't necessarily do this uh in
 
03:22:08.510 --> 03:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
an exact quantitative way but we're
 
03:22:10.830 --> 03:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at how successful are we
 
03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
in our cases you know are we winning are
 
03:22:16.189 --> 03:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
we losing um we don't just look at that
 
03:22:17.830 --> 03:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
because we have some very difficult
 
03:22:19.550 --> 03:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
cases that we're often on defense on
 
03:22:21.269 --> 03:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
where we're up against the eightball
 
03:22:25.309 --> 03:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
right and and so uh so we don't just
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
measure in whether we're winning or not
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
we also we trying to look at the quality
 
03:22:31.349 --> 03:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
of of work people are doing the quality
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
of their pleadings uh and and get a
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
sense of how how people are developing
 
03:22:39.870 --> 03:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
as as writers or or oral Advocates so
 
03:22:41.429 --> 03:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
that that's sort of how we measure
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
quality growth growth uh productivity
 
03:22:46.750 --> 03:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day at the
 
03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice we are basically
 
03:22:52.750 --> 03:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
doing the work that lands in our lap for
 
03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
for the most part right so if the state
 
03:22:57.309 --> 03:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
gets sued we're handling the cases if
 
03:22:59.510 --> 03:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
crimes are committed we're Prosecuting
 
03:23:02.550 --> 03:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
them a lot of the the types of cases we
 
03:23:05.790 --> 03:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
do with some exceptions we we will
 
03:23:07.790 --> 03:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
basically do all of those cases so for
 
03:23:10.750 --> 03:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
instance we handle all of the murder
 
03:23:13.030 --> 03:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
cases that happen in the state we handle
 
03:23:15.389 --> 03:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
all allegations of criminal conduct
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
against on duty law en or state
 
03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
officials we are the only agency doing
 
03:23:23.070 --> 03:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud right drug cases are a
 
03:23:26.469 --> 03:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
little bit different we we do the more
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
serious drug cases but we also try at
 
03:23:31.550 --> 03:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
times to to just take some of the load
 
03:23:33.630 --> 03:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
off of the County attorneys so we're
 
03:23:35.389 --> 03:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
we're sort of do doing the work that
 
03:23:37.550 --> 03:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
comes to us and for the most part not
 
03:23:39.389 --> 03:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
doing the work that that doesn't land in
 
03:23:42.590 --> 03:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
our lab there's some discretion but but
 
03:23:44.510 --> 03:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're a law enforcement agency for
 
03:23:47.790 --> 03:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
the most part at at the end of the day
 
03:23:52.150 --> 03:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
so so in general is your impression that
 
03:23:55.630 --> 03:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
crime is up or down over the last I
 
03:23:57.830 --> 03:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't know decade half decade something
 
03:23:57.840 --> 03:23:59.750 align:start position:0%
don't know decade half decade something
like

03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:24:03.990 --> 03:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
that or about the same as it yeah uh so
 
03:24:06.590 --> 03:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
a couple things on that I I I can say
 
03:24:08.630 --> 03:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
until last year it seemed the number of
 
03:24:10.830 --> 03:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
homicides per year were trending up
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
historically we've had 18 to 19 I guess
 
03:24:15.389 --> 03:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say homicides murder cases
 
03:24:16.389 --> 03:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
that come to the Department of Justice
 
03:24:20.590 --> 03:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
say 181 19 per year uh I believe in 22
 
03:24:23.630 --> 03:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
and 23 we were in in the high 20s you
 
03:24:25.750 --> 03:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
know so the the average number of of
 
03:24:27.990 --> 03:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
murder murders in the state has been
 
03:24:32.670 --> 03:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
trending up not in a uh I would say
 
03:24:36.429 --> 03:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
um too dramatic sense but it you know if
 
03:24:38.469 --> 03:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
you go from if you think about it from a
 
03:24:41.349 --> 03:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
percentage standpoint it's pretty pretty
 
03:24:43.670 --> 03:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
significant but I I I hesitate to think
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
in percentages when you're starting at
 
03:24:46.990 --> 03:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
numbers like 18 and 19 because you could
 
03:24:48.189 --> 03:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
have three or four but this piece of
 
03:24:49.429 --> 03:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
paper says
 
03:24:49.439 --> 03:24:51.710 align:start position:0%
paper says
68

03:24:51.710 --> 03:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
68
 
03:24:54.590 --> 03:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
well that for one that's bium but it's
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
also okay I I think homicide
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
cases both new ones that are opened and
 
03:25:02.590 --> 03:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
cases we're working on right so if a
 
03:25:05.229 --> 03:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
murder happens in 2022 you know the
 
03:25:06.670 --> 03:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
trial is probably going to happen maybe
 
03:25:11.790 --> 03:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
in late 2023 2024 so so we both we get
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
new cases all the
 
03:25:16.349 --> 03:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
time and we've still got the cases we're
 
03:25:18.590 --> 03:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
working on I see so this is the number
 
03:25:21.389 --> 03:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
of active cases total over the bium is
 
03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of what it is I see as opposed
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
to the number that was opened and the
 
03:25:27.030 --> 03:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
number that was
 
03:25:29.830 --> 03:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
closed correct yeah that might be a
 
03:25:32.910 --> 03:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
better way to measure it yeah yeah there
 
03:25:34.510 --> 03:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
are different ways to measure like I
 
03:25:37.189 --> 03:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
said these numbers we have given you
 
03:25:38.870 --> 03:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
just to be clear and transparent they're
 
03:25:41.189 --> 03:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
not meant to say to you you know this is
 
03:25:45.349 --> 03:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
to give this is to really closely track
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
the productivity of the Department of
 
03:25:50.189 --> 03:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
Justice it's to give you a snapshot if I
 
03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
were going to try to get into the weeds
 
03:25:55.070 --> 03:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
and track that productivity for you I
 
03:25:56.750 --> 03:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
think I would have a presentation just
 
03:25:59.189 --> 03:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
based on that and really hone in on
 
03:26:02.349 --> 03:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
these numbers so I I don't want to and
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
i' we've presented numbers like this I
 
03:26:05.309 --> 03:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
think in just about every budget
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
presentation for you know going back as
 
03:26:09.830 --> 03:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
far as I can remember since I've either
 
03:26:11.790 --> 03:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
been attorney general or Governor's
 
03:26:13.309 --> 03:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
legal council this is meant to give you
 
03:26:14.990 --> 03:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
a snapshot so sure there are different
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
ways to measure the numbers
 
03:26:20.710 --> 03:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay all right let's go to the uh page I
 
03:26:23.950 --> 03:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
guess it's page five so this says uh
 
03:26:26.670 --> 03:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
recoveries this looks like the good news
 
03:26:26.680 --> 03:26:28.950 align:start position:0%
recoveries this looks like the good news
right

03:26:28.950 --> 03:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:26:34.349 --> 03:26:34.359 align:start position:0%
yes so um we've sued other people and
 
03:26:36.790 --> 03:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
received 98 million over the bium is
 
03:26:40.990 --> 03:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
that it yeah so so recoveries is um it's
 
03:26:43.750 --> 03:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
meant to Encompass both both sort of new
 
03:26:45.309 --> 03:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
cases where we've recovered money and
 
03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
also just on goinging settlements say
 
03:26:50.030 --> 03:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
yearslong settlements where we have to
 
03:26:52.750 --> 03:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
do work at the doj that brings in
 
03:26:56.110 --> 03:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue so this this number is actually
 
03:26:58.870 --> 03:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
lower than in some past two-year periods
 
03:27:00.269 --> 03:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
because this number does include the
 
03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
tobacco money so when you take the
 
03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
tobacco money out of 98 million we
 
03:27:08.590 --> 03:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
actually in 23 and 24 didn't do as well
 
03:27:10.910 --> 03:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
as we've done in some other twoyear
 
03:27:13.830 --> 03:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
periods I still include it here because
 
03:27:16.189 --> 03:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
it's Revenue the office is generating
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
because the state doesn't just get the
 
03:27:20.830 --> 03:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco money by doing nothing we get it
 
03:27:22.710 --> 03:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
regularly but we have a lot of
 
03:27:24.349 --> 03:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
obligations we have to continue to meet
 
03:27:25.950 --> 03:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of work we have to do to make
 
03:27:28.630 --> 03:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
sure we're getting our our tobacco
 
03:27:30.990 --> 03:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
payment and the doj is doing that so
 
03:27:32.429 --> 03:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
it's work we're doing that's that's
 
03:27:34.990 --> 03:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
bringing in it's bringing in revenue and
 
03:27:37.710 --> 03:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
it is it's a continued recovery the
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement is it's a it's an
 
03:27:42.550 --> 03:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
infinite you know it's sort of like the
 
03:27:44.030 --> 03:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
time period on that is infinite right
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
it's just ongoing ongoing in definitely
 
03:27:48.070 --> 03:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
so it's not a certain fraction of
 
03:27:49.950 --> 03:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
tobacco sold in New Hampshire or
 
03:27:52.670 --> 03:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
something like that well it's it it's
 
03:27:54.750 --> 03:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
it's based it's based on statistics like
 
03:27:56.429 --> 03:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
that but also based on the type of
 
03:27:58.429 --> 03:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement enforcement work we're doing
 
03:28:00.150 --> 03:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot that goes into it
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
so it's formula based but also based on
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
work we have to continue to do to meet
 
03:28:06.389 --> 03:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
our obligations under the agreement
 
03:28:08.550 --> 03:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
because we noticed that um The Liquor
 
03:28:10.670 --> 03:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
Commission does some tobacco enforcement
 
03:28:13.750 --> 03:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
they have a section where they go and
 
03:28:15.550 --> 03:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
you know send a 20-year-old in to buy a
 
03:28:18.750 --> 03:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
cigarett and you know find people if
 
03:28:20.309 --> 03:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
they don't if they sell to them and
 
03:28:22.469 --> 03:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
things like that right so right yeah
 
03:28:24.469 --> 03:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
what the state gets is it's based on the
 
03:28:26.950 --> 03:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide efforts right so it's it's not
 
03:28:29.229 --> 03:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
just the doj doing say the enforcement
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
work but the doj is responsible for
 
03:28:34.189 --> 03:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
tracking everything that's happening so
 
03:28:35.870 --> 03:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
you look into that kind of stuff making
 
03:28:37.269 --> 03:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
sure we're meeting our obligations if
 
03:28:39.070 --> 03:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
we're not correcting what needs to be
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
corrected so that we don't endanger that
 
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream gotcha
 
03:28:47.790 --> 03:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
okay um oh opioid settlement that's
 
03:28:50.110 --> 03:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
oxycotton or something is yeah so those
 
03:28:52.510 --> 03:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
are the various opioid lawsuits we we've
 
03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
brought over over the past uh six to
 
03:28:59.070 --> 03:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
seven years and it we just track the
 
03:29:00.910 --> 03:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
money that is continuing to come in that
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to recover from those
 
03:29:04.680 --> 03:29:06.670 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to recover from those
settlements

03:29:06.670 --> 03:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
settlements
 
03:29:06.680 --> 03:29:08.750 align:start position:0%
settlements
okay

03:29:08.750 --> 03:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:29:11.510 --> 03:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
um all right yeah it might be better for
 
03:29:13.510 --> 03:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
these kind of to have a little more
 
03:29:17.110 --> 03:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
detail of Year bye kind of things for
 
03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
this you know for like a 5-year period
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
or something like that can I ask
 
03:29:22.910 --> 03:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
question yes go ahead
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
represent so um under doj recoveries you
 
03:29:29.910 --> 03:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
have Grant funds managed is that a
 
03:29:32.590 --> 03:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
recovery or what does what is that
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
category so Grant F we we go out and we
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
apply for federal grants we bring the
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
grant money in and much of our grant
 
03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
money is is subg granted out to others
 
03:29:50.110 --> 03:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
so either other state agencies or other
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh entities out in the state so it we I
 
03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
include it under here I think we've
 
03:29:57.750 --> 03:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
included under here for a long time
 
03:30:01.110 --> 03:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
because it's not um it's not say the doj
 
03:30:04.670 --> 03:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
is applying for federal money to do
 
03:30:08.070 --> 03:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
things at the doj I mean we a segment of
 
03:30:10.510 --> 03:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
the federal grants we get do that but
 
03:30:12.990 --> 03:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
most of our Federal grant money comes in
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
we bring it in we do the work to go and
 
03:30:16.750 --> 03:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
get it and bring it in and we send it
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
out and could you just clarify when you
 
03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
when it comes to litigation settlements
 
03:30:23.950 --> 03:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
that can be very large amounts of money
 
03:30:26.910 --> 03:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
in the settlement agreement it's usually
 
03:30:29.790 --> 03:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
clarified how you're supposed to use the
 
03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
funds when they come into the state it's
 
03:30:33.790 --> 03:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
not like everything can go in the
 
03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
general fund and we can have fun with it
 
03:30:39.510 --> 03:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
right it's but is there some portion of
 
03:30:42.070 --> 03:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
settlement funds that are if you could
 
03:30:44.790 --> 03:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
just sure seems like there's a statute
 
03:30:46.510 --> 03:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:30:48.750 --> 03:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
so 10% of any amount over a million
 
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
dollars has to go in the rainy day fund
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
um and we actually we are pretty
 
03:30:55.830 --> 03:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
restricted on how we can put
 
03:30:57.630 --> 03:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
stipulations on any settlement dollars
 
03:30:59.710 --> 03:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
we get and where those dollars can go
 
03:31:02.150 --> 03:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's a change the legislature made I
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
think back in 2013 20 2014 it used to be
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
that if we say went out and sued
 
03:31:09.150 --> 03:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
somebody let's say we settled for $5
 
03:31:10.990 --> 03:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
million we could write into the
 
03:31:12.429 --> 03:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement oh the money has to
 
03:31:13.750 --> 03:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
be used for this the money has to be
 
03:31:15.550 --> 03:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
used for that the legislature is
 
03:31:15.560 --> 03:31:16.670 align:start position:0%
used for that the legislature is
actually

03:31:16.670 --> 03:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:31:18.510 --> 03:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
tightened that up and restricted us from
 
03:31:21.309 --> 03:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
doing that that said the legislature has
 
03:31:23.110 --> 03:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
decided to send certain settlement
 
03:31:27.070 --> 03:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
Monies to certain places yeah or
 
03:31:30.389 --> 03:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh the p p settlements for instance I
 
03:31:32.349 --> 03:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
was wondering you told me before what
 
03:31:34.510 --> 03:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
you anticipated for that but I don't
 
03:31:36.750 --> 03:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
remember did you say 30 we we we're
 
03:31:39.670 --> 03:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
estimating around $65 million and we
 
03:31:40.910 --> 03:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
actually believe the payments are going
 
03:31:42.670 --> 03:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
to start coming in pretty soon in the
 
03:31:44.590 --> 03:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
next month or two I didn't include that
 
03:31:46.150 --> 03:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
in our recoveries here cuz the money
 
03:31:48.189 --> 03:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
hasn't actually come in yet but it's
 
03:31:51.189 --> 03:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
worthy of no yes and that goes to the
 
03:31:53.229 --> 03:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
drinking water trust fund right so the
 
03:31:54.910 --> 03:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
legislature has directed where some of
 
03:31:57.030 --> 03:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
this money goes we at doj for the most
 
03:32:00.150 --> 03:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
part don't do that okay thank you y all
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
right let's go to the page um original
 
03:32:02.760 --> 03:32:07.910 align:start position:0%
right let's go to the page um original
agency

03:32:07.910 --> 03:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:07.920 --> 03:32:13.590 align:start position:0%
 
request

03:32:13.590 --> 03:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:26.750 --> 03:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
looks it looks as though my microphone
 
03:32:29.710 --> 03:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
it looks as though um
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
you um asked for less money than what
 
03:32:36.309 --> 03:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
the governor gave you if I'm looking at
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
page 288 in house bill
 
03:32:42.870 --> 03:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
one yes and I C I can talk through that
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
if we we prepared the presentation to
 
03:32:47.429 --> 03:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
just try to
 
03:32:50.189 --> 03:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
explain that would you mind if I take a
 
03:32:52.269 --> 03:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
couple minutes to talk through that okay
 
03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
so the thank you the the original agency
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
request as you see here
 
03:33:01.389 --> 03:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
um didn't include a lot of non-state or
 
03:33:03.030 --> 03:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
non-federal Grant
 
03:33:05.950 --> 03:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
funds and so the original agency
 
03:33:07.389 --> 03:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
requests we really we knew we were
 
03:33:08.750 --> 03:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
coming into tough budget times we wanted
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
to focus on you know really the
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
Department's operation the money for the
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice is operational
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
needs that was the original agency
 
03:33:21.950 --> 03:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
request the next page shows the
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
governor's adjustments the governor
 
03:33:26.309 --> 03:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
actually we did actually you know take
 
03:33:29.670 --> 03:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
some fairly significant reductions in
 
03:33:32.670 --> 03:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
operations funds we had six generally
 
03:33:35.349 --> 03:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
funded positions unfunded two federally
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
funded positions unfunded so that that
 
03:33:39.189 --> 03:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
money could be repurposed to other
 
03:33:40.990 --> 03:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
things and restructured some of the drug
 
03:33:43.750 --> 03:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
task force funding which included
 
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
federal funds and general funds
 
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
the governor though and and I and I
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
support this we the unfunded positions
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
were vacant yes yes okay thank
 
03:33:58.229 --> 03:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
yep the governor and I discussed some
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
other priorities though and these are
 
03:34:02.229 --> 03:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
very important priorities to her but
 
03:34:05.349 --> 03:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
they Encompass some significant
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
non-federal grants so they these do not
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
involve the Department of Justice like
 
03:34:12.950 --> 03:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
operations for the Department of Justice
 
03:34:15.269 --> 03:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
but they are money that they are funds
 
03:34:17.670 --> 03:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
that go into into our budget and so we
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
have the internet crimes against
 
03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
children task force there's $800,000 on
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
top of what we requested the child
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
advocacy centers and uh victims of crime
 
03:34:32.030 --> 03:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
supplemental funds for for for various
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
programs that support Crime Victims
 
03:34:36.389 --> 03:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the state I've talked about
 
03:34:38.830 --> 03:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
that before that comes from something
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
we've called sort of the the call it the
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
VCA gap for many years we were getting
 
03:34:47.189 --> 03:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
Federal grant funds under uh the victims
 
03:34:48.750 --> 03:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
of crime act the federal victims of
 
03:34:52.510 --> 03:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
crime act those funds have been
 
03:34:55.030 --> 03:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
decreasing we had been getting about or
 
03:34:56.349 --> 03:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
getting enough to spend about $10
 
03:34:58.750 --> 03:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
million a year on on programs for
 
03:35:00.670 --> 03:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
victims of crime around the state for
 
03:35:03.750 --> 03:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
victim services with the federal fund
 
03:35:06.910 --> 03:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
reduction the governor just recognizing
 
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
how important it is to serve victims of
 
03:35:11.229 --> 03:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
crime uh recognizing these are critical
 
03:35:12.910 --> 03:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
programs all around the state
 
03:35:14.790 --> 03:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
supplemented the reduction in those
 
03:35:16.229 --> 03:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
federal funds with
 
03:35:19.870 --> 03:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
with General funds so these are not with
 
03:35:22.349 --> 03:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
maybe exceptions for a very very small
 
03:35:23.790 --> 03:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars and I'm talking in the
 
03:35:25.750 --> 03:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
thousands for the most part not dollars
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
that relate to the operations of the
 
03:35:28.910 --> 03:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice but they are
 
03:35:30.229 --> 03:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the Department of
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
Justice so that we can subgrant them out
 
03:35:35.870 --> 03:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
can you point out these three things in
 
03:35:38.469 --> 03:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
house bill one I can do that if you'd
 
03:35:42.189 --> 03:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
like yeah go ahead uh it's page 243 and
 
03:35:44.469 --> 03:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
it's class line
 
03:35:47.790 --> 03:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
73 just the last one yep for the
 
03:35:49.510 --> 03:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
additions the grants are all in one

class line it's at the bottom oh all
 
03:35:53.750 --> 03:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
three are together yep I
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
see page
 
03:35:59.469 --> 03:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
243 and at the bottom it's class line
 
03:36:03.010 --> 03:36:03.020 align:start position:0%
073 uhuh BR
 
03:36:03.020 --> 03:36:04.389 align:start position:0%
073 uhuh BR
[Music]

03:36:04.389 --> 03:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
Federal and if you turn the page there's
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
a footnote that discusses um the
 
03:36:11.950 --> 03:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the internet child
 
03:36:14.469 --> 03:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
against children and the children
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.670 --> 03:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
that's okay so these
 
03:36:27.630 --> 03:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
are are are these
 
03:36:30.349 --> 03:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
um victims of crime supplement these
 
03:36:32.910 --> 03:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
three things are they all brand new or
 
03:36:35.229 --> 03:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
they used to get little tiny amounts of
 
03:36:38.110 --> 03:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
of uh General
 
03:36:38.120 --> 03:36:39.950 align:start position:0%
of uh General
funds

03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:36:42.189 --> 03:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
the the victims of
 
03:36:44.710 --> 03:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
crime General funds so the the victim
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
Services General funds these are brand
 
03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
new we have not before given any general
 
03:36:50.670 --> 03:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
funds to these programs because it's
 
03:36:53.229 --> 03:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
been a it's been a ferally funded
 
03:36:56.349 --> 03:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
effort internet crimes against children
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
task force the state has been
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
appropriating General funds for this
 
03:37:03.870 --> 03:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
for a number of years I think this is
 
03:37:06.269 --> 03:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
flat funded from before we didn't put it
 
03:37:08.189 --> 03:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
in our agency requests this year but we
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
did we did get it in the last bium so
 
03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
1.3 million is not an increase from the
 
03:37:19.030 --> 03:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
last by any them and I say 1.3 million
 
03:37:21.630 --> 03:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
because we had five we had 500,000 in
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
our request the governor added
 
03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
800,000 for the child advocacy centers I
 
03:37:31.469 --> 03:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
think we we had I think 100,000 per year
 
03:37:33.510 --> 03:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
in our requests the governor added 2.8
 
03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
million that is consistent though with
 
03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
an hb2 appropriation from the last
 
03:37:43.150 --> 03:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
budget so these amounts have gone up
 
03:37:48.269 --> 03:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
over the years but not they aren't all
 
03:37:50.670 --> 03:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
this uh this money is not all new money
 
03:37:52.990 --> 03:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at the the iak and the and
 
03:37:56.750 --> 03:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
the cacs okay now you said victims of
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
crime there's also Federal money as well
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
is that right yes and what page would
 
03:38:02.160 --> 03:38:08.630 align:start position:0%
is that right yes and what page would
that

03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:11.349 --> 03:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
be Kathy's going to help me I'll tell
 
03:38:22.189 --> 03:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
and by the way what while we're on page
 
03:38:31.070 --> 03:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
243 um fiscal year 2024 actual has this
 
03:38:35.870 --> 03:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
giant litigation cost that's $7 million
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
going down to 350,000 for the next three
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
years so what's that so that is our
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
litigation fund so as long as I can
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
remember the legislature has asked us
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
we've we've gotten a pretty small amount
 
03:38:52.750 --> 03:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
in our budget and we come back to fiscal
 
03:38:55.309 --> 03:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
every year with an estimate of the money
 
03:38:57.229 --> 03:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to need for litigation funds
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
so we've stopped budgeting that because
 
03:39:03.950 --> 03:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's we we it just is it has never been
 
03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
handled through the budget we get
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
$350,000 each fiscal year budgeted we
 
03:39:11.710 --> 03:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
come back to fiscal based on what the
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
needs are going to be and that really
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
just depends on what cases end up
 
03:39:18.670 --> 03:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
Landing with us and how much we need to
 
03:39:21.269 --> 03:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
make sure we cover it all we decided
 
03:39:23.349 --> 03:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
years ago that if we put a large Fund in
 
03:39:26.229 --> 03:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
there it became a target for the people
 
03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
that wanted to sue the state yeah so if
 
03:39:30.269 --> 03:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
we put too much money in there oh I can
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
go get a piece of
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
that yeah so that's for the last few
 
03:39:35.990 --> 03:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
years it's been some number between six
 
03:39:39.710 --> 03:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
and 8 million per per year so does this
 
03:39:43.389 --> 03:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
strictly pay people when we lose a case
 
03:39:46.189 --> 03:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
or is this also cover our attorneys to
 
03:39:48.030 --> 03:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
defend us and all this kind of stuff it
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
covers out outside councel outside
 
03:39:53.670 --> 03:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
experts Consultants uh depending on how
 
03:39:56.349 --> 03:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
complicated the case is that we we may
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
we may need that okay can you get us a
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet of like six years worth of
 
03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
History including details like that how
 
03:40:09.870 --> 03:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
much was paid to litigant how much uh
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
was our Council how much was the
 
03:40:12.479 --> 03:40:14.110 align:start position:0%
was our Council how much was the
different

03:40:14.110 --> 03:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
categories yes we can do that um and I
 
03:40:17.359 --> 03:40:18.389 align:start position:0%
categories yes we can do that um and I
would

03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
just yeah so yes we will get that for
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
you and I would just note that by law
 
03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
we're required to submit that type of
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
report at the end of every bium so we do
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
we do submit those types of reports to
 
03:40:31.389 --> 03:40:31.399 align:start position:0%
the legislature but of course for
 
03:40:32.830 --> 03:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
purposes of the budget process we'll get
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
that to you for the last six years more
 
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
like a anyway represent W yeah on the
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
page where you show your recoveries and
 
03:40:40.590 --> 03:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
you show
 
03:40:44.590 --> 03:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
8177 977 State debts recovered what
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
period of time is
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
that uh 23 and 24 calendar year 23 and
 
03:40:53.389 --> 03:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
24 that's how much you recovered in just
 
03:40:56.429 --> 03:40:56.439 align:start position:0%
two years debt that that's from debt
 
03:40:58.189 --> 03:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
collection so
 
03:41:00.910 --> 03:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
what they're usually smaller Because by
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
the time it gets to us for debt
 
03:41:04.510 --> 03:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
collection it means that whatever other
 
03:41:06.429 --> 03:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
agency in the state who was going out to
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
get that money hasn't been able to get
 
03:41:11.349 --> 03:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
it because perhaps somebody who owes the
 
03:41:13.950 --> 03:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
state the money is you know uh at that
 
03:41:16.990 --> 03:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
point and pretty close to destitute or
 
03:41:19.229 --> 03:41:19.239 align:start position:0%
bankrupt so we often only are able to
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
recover Pennies on the dollar but we
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
only have one attorney that does that
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
work so while it's not a lot the
 
03:41:27.870 --> 03:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
investment I think is worth it we're
 
03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
probably spending
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
$100,000 between1 $150,000 a year on the
 
03:41:33.630 --> 03:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
attorney we're still getting several
 
03:41:36.590 --> 03:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
00,000 a year in so it where did that
 
03:41:40.149 --> 03:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
money go in those years it goes into the
 
03:41:42.309 --> 03:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
general fund right or no do we keep it
 
03:41:44.950 --> 03:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
so a portion takes care of paying for
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
the attorney okay and the rest of it
 
03:41:51.110 --> 03:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
goes back um a percentage of it goes to
 
03:41:51.120 --> 03:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
goes back um a percentage of it goes to
the

03:41:51.910 --> 03:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:41:56.149 --> 03:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
agency that um that needed to collect
 
03:41:58.510 --> 03:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
that debt so it goes to the agency who's
 
03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
owed that debt so it doesn't like we see
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
a net positive here very much okay thank
 
03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
you representative eel yeah I I think
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is what you're saying but I just
 
03:42:09.910 --> 03:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to ask the question again so I'm
 
03:42:12.990 --> 03:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
looking like on page 43 where it says
 
03:42:16.389 --> 03:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
grants nonfederal it goes go I don't
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
know 25 from 450 and then it jumps up to
 
03:42:22.910 --> 03:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
many several millions of dollars so
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
that's and then later it's it's General
 
03:42:27.110 --> 03:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
funds so it's basically this part of
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
Europe she's added that to replace
 
03:42:33.630 --> 03:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
Federal funding that is no long is that
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's the story yes so now it's a
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation correct of
 
03:42:41.910 --> 03:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
several million okay or 13 but but I'd
 
03:42:43.309 --> 03:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
like to see the page where the federal
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
funding is going down
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:55.550 --> 03:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:59.710 --> 03:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
you so um we're
 
03:43:03.630 --> 03:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
we budgeted based on estimates of what
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
we have left over plus what we're
 
03:43:10.189 --> 03:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
expecting to get um we try to be very
 
03:43:11.710 --> 03:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
care we knew these funds were going to
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
be going down so in 25 we were at 8.68 n
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
million um we budgeted
 
03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
6.45 million but that
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
includes a small we try to be very
 
03:43:28.349 --> 03:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
careful with our funds to make it spread
 
03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
out as much as possible so it does
 
03:43:33.229 --> 03:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
include a little bit of money that we
 
03:43:33.239 --> 03:43:34.189 align:start position:0%
include a little bit of money that we
plan

03:43:34.189 --> 03:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
on supplementing the loss um we're
 
03:43:38.640 --> 03:43:39.950 align:start position:0%
on supplementing the loss um we're
expecting

03:43:39.950 --> 03:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
expecting
 
03:43:44.229 --> 03:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
between probably a three to four million
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
doll loss in federal funds um but when
 
03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
you get your federal funds they're
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
always in multiple years so um we try to
 
03:43:57.149 --> 03:43:57.159 align:start position:0%
spend them spread the money out um to
 
03:44:00.309 --> 03:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
serve as many victim Services as we can
 
03:44:01.870 --> 03:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
so they can serve the
 
03:44:04.469 --> 03:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
victims so to me this looks flat this
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like it's
 
03:44:09.510 --> 03:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
declining right well in four and eight
 
03:44:12.510 --> 03:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
and get 12 and I had six and six and get
 
03:44:17.229 --> 03:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:21.309 --> 03:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
so it's it's we actually spent
 
03:44:24.189 --> 03:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
4.2 yes um that wasn't what we were
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
budgeted um for 24 25 um we had 8.6 so
 
03:44:35.229 --> 03:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
if you compare 25 to 26 it went down
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
like 2.2 million and and just to add to
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
that I think I I think what we'll get to
 
03:44:41.429 --> 03:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
your question representative is
 
03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
that the the federal fund so the federal
 
03:44:44.760 --> 03:44:46.070 align:start position:0%
that the the federal fund so the federal
funds

03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:44:49.870 --> 03:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
budgeted in 24 and 25 well actually no
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
never mind I'm missing that yeah yeah so
 
03:44:55.229 --> 03:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
that it's the same Federal number so do
 
03:44:56.830 --> 03:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
you think that that what's in the budget
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
for 25 is inaccurate and when we
 
03:45:01.309 --> 03:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
actually get to the end of 25 it won't
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
be 8
 
03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
million it'll be more like 4 point
 
03:45:06.159 --> 03:45:07.189 align:start position:0%
million it'll be more like 4 point
something

03:45:07.189 --> 03:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
or so the actual expense is not what we
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
contracted out what we subg granted out
 
03:45:16.349 --> 03:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
the actual expense is what our subg
 
03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
grantees had spent in that year we can
 
03:45:23.630 --> 03:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
only pay them once they report to us
 
03:45:27.950 --> 03:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
what they spent um so that's what we
 
03:45:29.790 --> 03:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
ended up um
 
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursing those um nonprofits and um
 
03:45:39.910 --> 03:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
other victim Services um we we budget
 
03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
what we need to commit so even though
 
03:45:45.910 --> 03:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's our actual expense
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
we had to BR we brought those subg
 
03:45:50.830 --> 03:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
grants forward so we could continue to
 
03:45:54.510 --> 03:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
reimburse okay who gets this
 
03:46:00.070 --> 03:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
money so um we can get you a whole list
 
03:46:04.429 --> 03:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
of of the there is a large list of
 
03:46:06.990 --> 03:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
victim services that receed this money
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
and we'll I'll make sure to write that
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
down and get you a list yeah we I mean
 
03:46:13.750 --> 03:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
we've got the list so we'll just send it
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
to you I mean I've got I've got it right
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
here but we can send you a list but it
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
is just for just a some examples it's
 
03:46:22.590 --> 03:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
County attorney offices so the county
 
03:46:25.030 --> 03:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
attorney offices will use this to pay
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
for victim advocates in the office it's
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
the Coalition against Domestic and
 
03:46:30.630 --> 03:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence and money will will go
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
out to all the various crisis centers
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
around the state it's the child advocacy
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
centers so the child advocacy centers
 
03:46:39.309 --> 03:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
also get some of this money in addition
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
to to separate money uh organizations
 
03:46:45.990 --> 03:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
like Catholic Charities do do work with
 
03:46:49.630 --> 03:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
victims Casa uh some cities
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities if they're paying for
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
victim advocates in their police
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
departments it's a it's a wide range of
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
different organizations but it's all
 
03:47:02.550 --> 03:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much all either government loc
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
local government or or nonprofit who are
 
03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
doing work for for
 
03:47:10.189 --> 03:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
victims so we can get you the full list
 
03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
I have it right here we can send it to
 
03:47:14.309 --> 03:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
you yeah yeah so it's it's like shelters
 
03:47:17.110 --> 03:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a victim's not getting a
 
03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
check right it's it's more
 
03:47:23.510 --> 03:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
like a victim is in out of their home
 
03:47:25.030 --> 03:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
and then they're in the shelter or
 
03:47:27.510 --> 03:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
something like this right so it's it's
 
03:47:29.590 --> 03:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
that it's a victim ad you know victim
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
Advocates that'll fund a victim Advocate
 
03:47:33.469 --> 03:47:33.479 align:start position:0%
position who helps a victim navigate the
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system as their case is
 
03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
going through Court there are programs
 
03:47:40.389 --> 03:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
that provide sort of maybe some
 
03:47:43.030 --> 03:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
temporary housing assistance for victims
 
03:47:45.070 --> 03:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
in certain situations but that's not
 
03:47:48.110 --> 03:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
where most of this money goes but I I
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to say that there are no
 
03:47:51.189 --> 03:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
instances in where some of this money
 
03:47:53.790 --> 03:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
goes directly to a victim but it that's
 
03:47:55.710 --> 03:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
not really the primary purpose of of
 
03:47:57.910 --> 03:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
this money it's to it's more for
 
03:48:01.229 --> 03:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
services for that victim people who help
 
03:48:04.269 --> 03:48:04.279 align:start position:0%
a victim as they navigate the criminal
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
justice system or as that victim tries
 
03:48:09.269 --> 03:48:09.279 align:start position:0%
to access other services that they're
 
03:48:10.750 --> 03:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
that they're eligible for you have
 
03:48:13.389 --> 03:48:13.399 align:start position:0%
someone there who who helps them do that
 
03:48:15.790 --> 03:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
I see okay
 
03:48:20.309 --> 03:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
um great how do you decide who gets
 
03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
what yes yes so we do an RFP process we
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
have applications come in from
 
03:48:27.750 --> 03:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
organizations around the state our
 
03:48:31.030 --> 03:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
grants management unit goes through uh a
 
03:48:33.229 --> 03:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
process to evaluate all those look at
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
what they're proposing to use the
 
03:48:38.030 --> 03:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
funding for recommendations come to me I
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
look at them I sign off on them we do
 
03:48:43.469 --> 03:48:43.479 align:start position:0%
Grant agreements we take it through the
 
03:48:45.149 --> 03:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
governor and executive counsel so
 
03:48:46.950 --> 03:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a long process
 
03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
involved for deciding who gets what and
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of eyes on it and how much is
 
03:48:53.550 --> 03:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
expenses for all
 
03:48:58.110 --> 03:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
that is there several full-time people
 
03:49:02.189 --> 03:49:02.199 align:start position:0%
or we we
 
03:49:04.189 --> 03:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
have let me just make sure I get these
 
03:49:07.149 --> 03:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
numbers right it's grants we have a
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
grants management unit that manages all
 
03:49:10.510 --> 03:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
of our
 
03:49:14.469 --> 03:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
grants not just the yeah so not just the
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
the is this the biggest Services
 
03:49:21.870 --> 03:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
Grants yeah yeah this is their total
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
budget not all of them do don't yeah but
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
there what do we have four full-time in
 
03:49:31.950 --> 03:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
the grants management unit six six
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
full-time in the grants management unit
 
03:49:35.070 --> 03:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
six full-time
 
03:49:36.910 --> 03:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
employees but one of one of the
 
03:49:38.510 --> 03:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
functions that
 
03:49:40.830 --> 03:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
they that they provide which I think is
 
03:49:42.269 --> 03:49:42.279 align:start position:0%
really important and it's important to
 
03:49:43.630 --> 03:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
understand for the grants and this is
 
03:49:45.070 --> 03:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent with a lot of grants
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
the state gives out we don't just write
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
a check for 250,000 bucks and send it
 
03:49:52.149 --> 03:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
out to an organization we say to an
 
03:49:54.309 --> 03:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
organization once it's approved you now
 
03:49:55.910 --> 03:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a grant for
 
03:49:58.349 --> 03:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
$250,000 but the money is dispersed on a
 
03:49:59.910 --> 03:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement basis where we're
 
03:50:02.830 --> 03:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
continuing to review what they're doing
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
the expenses they're incurring and we're
 
03:50:08.189 --> 03:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for those expenses that
 
03:50:10.510 --> 03:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time and effort so that
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's part of what the staff and the
 
03:50:13.990 --> 03:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
grants management unit do they also
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
manage all the applications they're
 
03:50:17.830 --> 03:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
always on the lookout for other grants
 
03:50:19.950 --> 03:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
that the state could potentially go out
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
and get yeah so this is the five people
 
03:50:23.269 --> 03:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
on page
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
270 well there's
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
one so there's five per and temporary oh
 
03:50:36.030 --> 03:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
no five permanence and one temporary oh
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
and there's more on victim Services I
 
03:50:41.189 --> 03:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
see another three on page
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
271 no well 265 and another uh
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and some people in 272 269 yeah I
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
see there's a whole bunch here okay yeah
 
03:50:52.920 --> 03:50:58.030 align:start position:0%
see there's a whole bunch here okay yeah
all

03:50:58.030 --> 03:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
right so it might be helpful to have
 
03:51:06.189 --> 03:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
grants as a whole a separate spreadsheet
 
03:51:08.750 --> 03:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
and and again with historical
 
03:51:12.910 --> 03:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
information right each one historical
 
03:51:16.670 --> 03:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
expenses for Grants something like that
 
03:51:20.510 --> 03:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any other questions on this
 
03:51:22.710 --> 03:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
area no we're good
 
03:51:26.429 --> 03:51:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:29.630 --> 03:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
right all right this is good
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
so uh last page here or is this
 
03:51:35.640 --> 03:51:38.189 align:start position:0%
so uh last page here or is this
um

03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:40.630 --> 03:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
yeah with additional grants without
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
additional grants I see all right one
 
03:51:46.229 --> 03:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
thing we've heard heard from some other
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
um Commissioners is that the governor at
 
03:51:53.070 --> 03:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
some point asked them to
 
03:51:56.990 --> 03:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
prepare um even further reduced budgets
 
03:52:00.550 --> 03:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
than their basic budget and and did they
 
03:52:02.630 --> 03:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
ask you to do that kind of
 
03:52:08.149 --> 03:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
thing yes okay and um did those
 
03:52:10.590 --> 03:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
reductions make it into the final budget
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
or not yes all of the reductions we
 
03:52:16.030 --> 03:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
prepared for the governor made in to our
 
03:52:18.070 --> 03:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
budget okay because I've heard from some
 
03:52:20.229 --> 03:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
others that that was not the case yeah
 
03:52:22.990 --> 03:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
it it may be but and I I can't sit here
 
03:52:24.790 --> 03:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
and represent to you that the reductions
 
03:52:27.309 --> 03:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
we were asked to prepare were as large
 
03:52:28.990 --> 03:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
as reductions other agencies were asked
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
to prepare but what I can confirm is
 
03:52:32.429 --> 03:52:32.439 align:start position:0%
that the reductions that we were asked
 
03:52:34.710 --> 03:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
to repair all made it into the budget
 
03:52:38.349 --> 03:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay and from this it looks like
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
except for the
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
grants you are spending less yeah yes
 
03:52:47.550 --> 03:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
yeah okay now are you so of your however
 
03:52:51.429 --> 03:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
many uh positions let's let's look at
 
03:52:51.439 --> 03:52:54.389 align:start position:0%
many uh positions let's let's look at
that

03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:58.189 --> 03:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
um 20 all so you have
 
03:52:58.199 --> 03:53:01.349 align:start position:0%
um 20 all so you have
196

03:53:01.349 --> 03:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:04.189 --> 03:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
positions um I'm on page
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
288 so you have uh 196 positions 131 are
 
03:53:12.110 --> 03:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
unclassified I'm assuming those are all
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys attorneys investigators
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
victim witness
 
03:53:19.790 --> 03:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
Specialists uh medical examiners and
 
03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's uh about half that number are
 
03:53:27.070 --> 03:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
regular assist classifi positions yeah
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay now that seems
 
03:53:34.349 --> 03:53:34.359 align:start position:0%
like like a high very high ratio of of
 
03:53:38.149 --> 03:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
chiefs to Indians I guess if you want to
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
do you know what I mean um because I
 
03:53:43.229 --> 03:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
think about like the Judiciary right
 
03:53:45.630 --> 03:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
where there's one judge five staff or
 
03:53:48.309 --> 03:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
something like that rather than here
 
03:53:52.630 --> 03:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's two attorneys for one staff
 
03:53:55.630 --> 03:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
yeah has it always been like this is it
 
03:53:58.710 --> 03:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
that is so
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
if yeah in any law firm it's very common
 
03:54:06.269 --> 03:54:06.279 align:start position:0%
to have you know more attorneys than
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
than support staff so interesting for
 
03:54:09.990 --> 03:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
one I'd say the breakdown between
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
unclassified and
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
classified we we might be
 
03:54:16.149 --> 03:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
may not be the highest percentage of
 
03:54:18.189 --> 03:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
unclassified of any agency but we're
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
certainly one of the highest every
 
03:54:22.990 --> 03:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer is an unclassified position but
 
03:54:24.389 --> 03:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
that goes all the way from the most
 
03:54:26.030 --> 03:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
Junior lawyer in the office who may have
 
03:54:28.710 --> 03:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
a year or two of experience to to me the
 
03:54:30.469 --> 03:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
the attorney general or you know there
 
03:54:31.710 --> 03:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
certain there are people in the office
 
03:54:33.630 --> 03:54:33.640 align:start position:0%
obviously have many more years in in the
 
03:54:36.990 --> 03:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
law that than I do so every lawyer is
 
03:54:40.030 --> 03:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
unclassified so it that's different than
 
03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
most agencies throughout state
 
03:54:43.229 --> 03:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
government usually in an agency in state
 
03:54:44.910 --> 03:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
government it's only the most people who
 
03:54:46.870 --> 03:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
tend to be unclassified all of our
 
03:54:49.030 --> 03:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers are unclassified all of our
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
investigators are unclassified even from
 
03:54:53.429 --> 03:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
the least experienced to the most all of
 
03:54:54.870 --> 03:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
our victim witness Advocates from the
 
03:54:56.790 --> 03:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
least experienced to the most it's just
 
03:55:00.070 --> 03:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's a unique we are a we are a unique
 
03:55:03.510 --> 03:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
agency in that sense okay and so how
 
03:55:05.830 --> 03:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
many of these are vacant and unfunded
 
03:55:10.510 --> 03:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.510 --> 03:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
stuff so
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
do you want to know the
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
unfunded yeah start with vacancies and
 
03:55:21.870 --> 03:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
then I how many of those are funded and
 
03:55:25.229 --> 03:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.239 --> 03:55:27.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
six six that we vacant eight that are
 
03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
vacant unfunded so eight vacant unfunded
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
and what are our total vacancies is it
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
22 but does the 22 include the
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:50.830 --> 03:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
okay but some of these are part time so
 
03:55:55.189 --> 03:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:58.830 --> 03:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I I believe I mean we'll the
 
03:56:00.870 --> 03:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
numbers I have here I think we have 22
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
total vacancies out of
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
213 temporary and permanent
 
03:56:10.189 --> 03:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
positions does this number include part
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
no okay the 213 does not include
 
03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
part-time positions so we have
 
03:56:17.870 --> 03:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
213 full-time temporary and permanent
 
03:56:21.550 --> 03:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
positions 22 of those are
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
vacant eight of those were unfunded in
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.229 --> 03:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
budget that's
 
03:56:35.229 --> 03:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
okay 2 yeah out of the 213 yes out of
 
03:56:35.239 --> 03:56:36.750 align:start position:0%
okay 2 yeah out of the 213 yes out of
the

03:56:36.750 --> 03:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:56:36.760 --> 03:56:39.870 align:start position:0%
the
23

03:56:39.870 --> 03:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
03:56:44.830 --> 03:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
right so
 
03:56:47.950 --> 03:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
um the other two general questions I
 
03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
have is I want I want to ask about the
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
the YDC lawsuit status and I remember um
 
03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
the last two years ago um you said to us
 
03:57:02.469 --> 03:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
we you have sovereign immunity and you
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
can decide who can sue you and how for
 
03:57:08.670 --> 03:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
details right
 
03:57:10.750 --> 03:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
um could
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
we um require all the victims to use the
 
03:57:23.429 --> 03:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
court I I think the way I interpret that
 
03:57:28.910 --> 03:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
question is B basically could we could
 
03:57:32.590 --> 03:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
we change the law such that we we don't
 
03:57:34.950 --> 03:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
wave sovereign immunity to any extent so
 
03:57:37.790 --> 03:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
that anyone who falls in the category of
 
03:57:39.630 --> 03:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
of the victims who who have sued the
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
state would not get a claim against the
 
03:57:43.870 --> 03:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
state in court their only option would
 
03:57:55.469 --> 03:57:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
fund we may face I'm going to be a
 
03:58:00.349 --> 03:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
little I want to be careful in in
 
03:58:02.269 --> 03:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
answering a question like this well it
 
03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
depends and and and here's the thing the
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
reason I'm going to be careful in
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
answering a question like this is
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
because if you were to decide to make a
 
03:58:10.630 --> 03:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
change like that or a similar change
 
03:58:12.990 --> 03:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
like that and then we get sued about
 
03:58:15.429 --> 03:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
that of course have to defend that
 
03:58:17.469 --> 03:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
action so I don't want to sit here and
 
03:58:22.710 --> 03:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
say if you do XYZ that's illegal but um
 
03:58:25.630 --> 03:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
we we may face challenges if we did that
 
03:58:27.710 --> 03:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
it it depends and it depends to what
 
03:58:29.950 --> 03:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
extent the legislature were to attempt
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
to do that okay
 
03:58:38.189 --> 03:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
um but you wouldn't refuse to defend Us
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
in that circumstance or I don't know I
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
mean is it how can how can you do is it
 
03:58:48.510 --> 03:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
is it a can you say we're 90% likely to
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
win such a case or 10% likely or or it
 
03:58:54.070 --> 03:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't work that way the advice I would
 
03:58:55.630 --> 03:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
I would give you and I would want to do
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
it in an attorney client privilege
 
03:58:59.670 --> 03:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
setting and not in public is whether I
 
03:59:01.910 --> 03:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
think there's a colorable argument at
 
03:59:03.910 --> 03:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
least just a a colorable non-frivolous
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
argument that we could make to defend an
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
action the legislature was was going to
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
take because as long as we can meet that
 
03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
threshold we would always defend it okay
 
03:59:16.269 --> 03:59:16.279 align:start position:0%
the other part about the yedc I wanted
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
to ask about is as I understand the way
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
the process or the law that we passed
 
03:59:27.990 --> 03:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
works is that um of the of the payments
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
um 2third go to the victim and one/ thir
 
03:59:32.590 --> 03:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
goes to their attorneys is that
 
03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
something we can change or
 
03:59:37.269 --> 03:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
not yes that that's something we could
 
03:59:38.870 --> 03:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
change in the statute and the the one
 
03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
the one clarification I would say to
 
03:59:42.670 --> 03:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
that is that what the statute says is
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
that the attorney fee can't be more than
 
03:59:48.269 --> 03:59:48.279 align:start position:0%
a third right which I think is important
 
03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
and we do try to to reemphasize and and
 
03:59:54.790 --> 03:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
the administrator has awarded fees in
 
03:59:57.309 --> 03:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
some cases Le less than a third so a
 
04:00:00.030 --> 04:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
third is is the maximum I see the
 
04:00:01.429 --> 04:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
additional factor that to keep in mind
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
is that to the extent a claimant or or a
 
04:00:06.750 --> 04:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
victim has a separate agreement with an
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
attorney on the
 
04:00:11.790 --> 04:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
side we we can't really control that so
 
04:00:14.189 --> 04:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
once once the the claimant has their
 
04:00:15.550 --> 04:00:15.560 align:start position:0%
money if they had a separate agreement
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
with the attorney that the attorney
 
04:00:18.910 --> 04:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
would get more and they decide to honor
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
that agreement and pay it to the
 
04:00:21.790 --> 04:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
attorney it's not something that the
 
04:00:24.630 --> 04:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
state can control I see yeah I've heard
 
04:00:26.830 --> 04:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
of cases where attorneys are lending
 
04:00:30.510 --> 04:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
money to to victims and then they have
 
04:00:32.429 --> 04:00:32.439 align:start position:0%
separate agreements on how they get paid
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
back and things like that yeah okay um
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm asking that particular
 
04:00:42.309 --> 04:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
question is we hear from the uh
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and I assume the same thing is
 
04:00:47.590 --> 04:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
true in your office that just the sheer
 
04:00:51.309 --> 04:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
volume of these cases is costing a lot
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
of um expense and so um I'm looking for
 
04:01:00.189 --> 04:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
a way to to somehow share that
 
04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
expense um with the uh other parties
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
right so um now and then the last
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
question I want to ask about this the
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
governor did not put the ongoing 75
 
04:01:17.790 --> 04:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
million a year into the budget
 
04:01:21.309 --> 04:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
so to what extent are we obligated to do
 
04:01:23.710 --> 04:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
that I mean it the what what I remember
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
from two years ago was that we sort of
 
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
made that agreement that you know for
 
04:01:29.710 --> 04:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
the next 10 years we're going to put 75
 
04:01:31.990 --> 04:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
million a year in the budget to cover
 
04:01:32.000 --> 04:01:33.750 align:start position:0%
million a year in the budget to cover
this

04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
expense so the the the first part of the
 
04:01:37.630 --> 04:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is the
 
04:01:40.510 --> 04:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
legislature is not legally obligated to
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
to continue to put 75 million in per
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
year um the second part of the answer to
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
that question is just to a reminder that
 
04:01:50.110 --> 04:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
the 75 million is is a cap it's an
 
04:01:53.670 --> 04:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
annual cap it's not a floor so it's an
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
annual cap it's the number up to which
 
04:01:58.189 --> 04:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
the administrator can authorize payments
 
04:02:00.269 --> 04:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
so I could see why the legislature you
 
04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
know some legislators might say well if
 
04:02:05.309 --> 04:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
if the cap is 75 million we'll budget 75
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
million but you're certainly not
 
04:02:09.189 --> 04:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
required to do that but you're also not
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
required to continue to put to put the
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
money in
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
I think there there was a um part of the
 
04:02:20.309 --> 04:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
reason for putting in the annual cap was
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
to say as long as we continue to do this
 
04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
fund we at least know we're not going to
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
put in more than 75 million per year and
 
04:02:32.110 --> 04:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
I think the 10 years stems from well if
 
04:02:35.030 --> 04:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
we keep this fund going for all of the
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
claimants that we expect to file claims
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
that might be the period of time over
 
04:02:42.149 --> 04:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
which we need to spread these payments
 
04:02:44.429 --> 04:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
out and keep this fund going that does
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
not mean though that the legislature has
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
legally obligated itself to continue
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
that and in fact I think is just as is
 
04:02:53.229 --> 04:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
discussed all the time in the
 
04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
legislature one legislature generally
 
04:02:57.910 --> 04:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
can't bind another right can't require a
 
04:02:59.910 --> 04:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
future legislature to make certain
 
04:03:02.229 --> 04:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and we did not at the
 
04:03:04.349 --> 04:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice sign any type of
 
04:03:06.349 --> 04:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
binding legal document that would bind
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
the state to that type of obligation
 
04:03:10.670 --> 04:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
well but on the other hand when you make
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
a settlement with somebody don't both of
 
04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
you sign some kind of agreement for
 
04:03:19.750 --> 04:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
individual cases yes right so once we
 
04:03:21.910 --> 04:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
have made an award to an individual
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
claimant the state is bound to that okay
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
but we are not bound to continue to fund
 
04:03:34.349 --> 04:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
potential Awards to to claimants that
 
04:03:37.149 --> 04:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
haven't got actually gotten an award yet
 
04:03:40.670 --> 04:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
oh are you saying that um we're only
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
settling with people with money we
 
04:03:47.189 --> 04:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
already have allocated and so therefore
 
04:03:50.189 --> 04:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
suppose the next guy down the list wants
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
to settle do we say sorry we can't
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
settle yet because the fund is empty yes
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
we and and and the administrator and I
 
04:04:01.309 --> 04:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
have discussed this I mean if if we
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
think the funds are going to run out or
 
04:04:05.670 --> 04:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
have run out and we can't fund further
 
04:04:07.030 --> 04:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
settlements we're not just going to
 
04:04:09.149 --> 04:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
continue to make further Awards or enter
 
04:04:11.870 --> 04:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
into further individual settlement
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
agreements yeah we're not going to do
 
04:04:16.630 --> 04:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
that okay so everybody who settled the
 
04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
money is there for
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
them everybody who's settled so far so
 
04:04:24.070 --> 04:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
far the yes the money is there with with
 
04:04:26.510 --> 04:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
this caveat right so to the extent that
 
04:04:29.469 --> 04:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
we've had some people set get Awards
 
04:04:31.469 --> 04:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
let's say a million dollar award paid
 
04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
out over eight years
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
sure if the fund runs out and we don't
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
make any more settlements there may need
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
to be some amount of money put in in the
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
future in the future to make sure we
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
fulfill those obligations so I can't say
 
04:04:49.750 --> 04:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
that every single
 
04:04:52.910 --> 04:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
dime is in the fund to be enough to pay
 
04:04:54.990 --> 04:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
those to pay all of those out but it
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a large amount of money if
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
we sto today if we sto today I I could
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
Envision even in a couple years needing
 
04:05:03.950 --> 04:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
to put a little more money in to
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
continue to honor those ongoing
 
04:05:06.479 --> 04:05:08.469 align:start position:0%
continue to honor those ongoing
agreements

04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay a representative camell thank you
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so how much is in the fund
 
04:05:15.670 --> 04:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
right now and did you collect the 75
 
04:05:18.110 --> 04:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
million for this year
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
already no so we we were appropriated or
 
04:05:22.590 --> 04:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
the fund I should say was appropriated
 
04:05:26.469 --> 04:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
$60 million for this current fiscal year
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
there which at the time this fiscal year
 
04:05:32.309 --> 04:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
started the fund was about at zero so
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
that we basically started the fiscal
 
04:05:37.870 --> 04:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
year with that 60 million there is uh
 
04:05:40.070 --> 04:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
depending on how you calculate it 26 to
 
04:05:43.149 --> 04:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
29 million remaining in the fund as of
 
04:05:43.159 --> 04:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
29 million remaining in the fund as of
today

04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.750 --> 04:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay and I would when you say he you
 
04:05:54.189 --> 04:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:56.269 --> 04:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
administrator yeah he's on our schedule
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
which oh
 
04:06:11.149 --> 04:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
okay so it looks like it's actually 32.3
 
04:06:14.189 --> 04:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
million is available 32.3 and a half
 
04:06:16.750 --> 04:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
pending okay yeah so with five and a
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
half pending so it's actually more like
 
04:06:20.110 --> 04:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
it's 27 million like like I said
 
04:06:21.429 --> 04:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
depending on how it's a significant
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
amount of money yes yes we are not we're
 
04:06:26.670 --> 04:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
not on the verge of running out at this
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
moment okay at this moment so are you
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
finding that
 
04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
that many victims are not inclined to go
 
04:06:36.670 --> 04:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
the settlement
 
04:06:39.630 --> 04:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
routes I mean can you
 
04:06:43.710 --> 04:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
tell I would say the pace of or the the
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
the um the rate at which victims are
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
filing the settlement fund has increased
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
I think we have over
 
04:06:50.479 --> 04:06:52.309 align:start position:0%
I think we have over
900

04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
900
 
04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
th just over a thousand victims have now
 
04:06:57.510 --> 04:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
filed in in the settlement fund oh so
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
the rate has significantly increased but
 
04:07:03.070 --> 04:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of those filings are more recent
 
04:07:05.710 --> 04:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
so it so it takes a while for the whole
 
04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
process to oh yeah it would take a while
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
to get through all thousand of those I
 
04:07:11.469 --> 04:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
think we've resolved somewhere between
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
250 and 300 originally your estimate was
 
04:07:18.630 --> 04:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
that 1,500 would would end up be being
 
04:07:22.349 --> 04:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:24.790 --> 04:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
correct as we sit here given I don't
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
mean in settlement I mean as either in
 
04:07:29.710 --> 04:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
cases or in settlements
 
04:07:32.149 --> 04:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I would say as we sit here
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
today that estimate I I still think is
 
04:07:38.030 --> 04:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
is pretty close to to the ballark given
 
04:07:39.870 --> 04:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
that it's just over a thousand and the
 
04:07:41.630 --> 04:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
deadline is going to be June 30th the
 
04:07:43.870 --> 04:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
deadline to file is June 30th and we
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
still we we have not hit the 1500 number
 
04:07:52.189 --> 04:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
in lawsuits filed in court so I I think
 
04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
1,500 around that would still remain my
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
estimate but if the pace really picks up
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
right at the end it could end up being
 
04:08:03.550 --> 04:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
more now do people both file in court
 
04:08:05.590 --> 04:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
and file for a
 
04:08:07.950 --> 04:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
settlement many have filed in both
 
04:08:09.550 --> 04:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
because many started out by filing
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in court but if you have a
 
04:08:13.750 --> 04:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
pending lawsuit and then you file a in
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
the settlement fund you have to pause
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
your lawsuit while your settlement fund
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
process plays out and then if you accept
 
04:08:21.950 --> 04:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
what you get in the settlement fund your
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit goes away I see thank you did I
 
04:08:26.590 --> 04:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
see a hand
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
no all right representative wer why did
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
we stretch out the
 
04:08:34.590 --> 04:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
deadline thought it was going to be the
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
year I I sort of remember that the
 
04:08:45.309 --> 04:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
administ asked for that right yeah it
 
04:08:48.149 --> 04:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
was part of the dis so when you know the
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
deadline the deadlines now been extended
 
04:08:51.790 --> 04:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of times and changes have been
 
04:08:53.630 --> 04:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
made to the fund you know based on
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with claimant's Council and
 
04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
the administrator and and our office and
 
04:09:00.429 --> 04:09:00.439 align:start position:0%
and and the governor's office
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
um that there it was look it was a
 
04:09:06.189 --> 04:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
compromise right so we've had a couple
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
couple different compromises as we've
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
gone through this process and the last
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
round of discussions the last compromise
 
04:09:14.349 --> 04:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
that resulted from the last round of
 
04:09:16.469 --> 04:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
discussions involved extending the
 
04:09:19.229 --> 04:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
settlement fund deadline by 6
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
months representative camell thank you
 
04:09:23.790 --> 04:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair do you think it's likely
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
extension there could be a request for
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
another extension and I'm I am perfectly
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable saying publicly that putting
 
04:09:36.990 --> 04:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
aside every other point that we we've
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
discussed about the settlement fund and
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
what might happen I would absolutely
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
recommend against any more extensions if
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to M if we are going to
 
04:09:46.750 --> 04:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
maintain the settlement fund and that's
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
a discussion that has to continue to be
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
had with with the governor and the
 
04:09:53.309 --> 04:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
legislature we absolutely should not
 
04:09:56.189 --> 04:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
extend the deadline again at some point
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
a decision has to be made there has to
 
04:10:01.070 --> 04:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
be a deadline that comes and goes so we
 
04:10:02.830 --> 04:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
have a sense of what the full scope of
 
04:10:04.670 --> 04:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
this is so that that is my
 
04:10:06.309 --> 04:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we should not extend
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
the deadline again follow up Mr chair
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
yes sir so um that would basically lock
 
04:10:13.950 --> 04:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
out people from filing for the for the
 
04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
fund that we've established it doesn't
 
04:10:18.109 --> 04:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
prevent anybody from suing in the future
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
anyway right correct thank
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
you okay all right um the other item I
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
have on my sort of general questions
 
04:10:29.830 --> 04:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
list we have a member of our committee
 
04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
who's very concerned about uh
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
Dei uh diversity equity and inclusion
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
and president Trump just recently made a
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
a executive
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
order cancelling all that kind of stuff
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
from the federal government are you
 
04:10:47.790 --> 04:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
aware of any of that in either in your
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
department or in the state
 
04:10:52.830 --> 04:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
generally those kind of initiatives or
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
those kind of I I'm not aware of
 
04:10:57.790 --> 04:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
anything within our department that
 
04:10:59.309 --> 04:10:59.319 align:start position:0%
would fall within the scope of what's
 
04:11:00.710 --> 04:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
covered by the president's executive
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
order and we're we're working with all
 
04:11:05.070 --> 04:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
of the agencies across state government
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
as we typically do whenever there's a
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
new requirement or prohibition to look
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
at the various programs people have
 
04:11:16.349 --> 04:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
whatever grants they have whatever other
 
04:11:18.910 --> 04:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
contracts they have to make sure that
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
there that there's nothing that would be
 
04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
inv violation of the president's
 
04:11:24.710 --> 04:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
executive order um I'm not going to sit
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
here and say I think we have none or we
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
have no contracts or programs or grants
 
04:11:33.910 --> 04:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
that that you know would would fall
 
04:11:35.149 --> 04:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
within the scope of the president's
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
executive order but I don't think it's
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to be a large amount at the end of
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
the day and we're going to be working
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
closely with agen genes to make sure
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
that we don't have anything that is out
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
of compliance okay on an ongoing basis
 
04:11:51.550 --> 04:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and the state does a lot of
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
things so you there's no way to answer
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
or do an analysis like that overnight
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
but we're working hard to get our arms
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
around it and make sure we stay in
 
04:12:03.389 --> 04:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
compliance with any federal or state
 
04:12:03.399 --> 04:12:04.950 align:start position:0%
compliance with any federal or state
requirements

04:12:04.950 --> 04:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
04:12:11.550 --> 04:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
so we're kind of out of yes go ahead
 
04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
represent view I know you have a lot
 
04:12:15.550 --> 04:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
well no but we're I'm going to say we're
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
about out of time time just could you
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
clarify what the statute of limitations
 
04:12:23.149 --> 04:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
is for the YDC CL cases to file in
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
Superior Court how the statute of
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
limitations Works in that is that will
 
04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
that take another 10 minutes it it won't
 
04:12:32.710 --> 04:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
take 10 minutes I wish it were a a
 
04:12:37.149 --> 04:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
simple answer but it it's not so um so
 
04:12:39.189 --> 04:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
for someone who who had a claim that
 
04:12:40.830 --> 04:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
that arises when they're a child
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
typically the statute limitations or the
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
the the black and white statute
 
04:12:46.269 --> 04:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
limitations would be 3 years from that
 
04:12:48.910 --> 04:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
person's 18th birthday but there's
 
04:12:51.389 --> 04:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
something called The Discovery rule
 
04:12:52.990 --> 04:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
which says that the statute doesn't
 
04:12:56.149 --> 04:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
start to run until that point at which
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
you either did discover or should have
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
through reasonable diligence discovered
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
your injury and so this this is an this
 
04:13:08.229 --> 04:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
is a fact specific inquiry for every
 
04:13:11.790 --> 04:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
individual case so while all of the
 
04:13:13.389 --> 04:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
claimants pretty much that have sued the
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
state sued long after 3 years from their
 
04:13:15.840 --> 04:13:17.030 align:start position:0%
state sued long after 3 years from their
18th

04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
18th
 
04:13:19.710 --> 04:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
birthday so far as we've litigated these
 
04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
cases the court has said we have to do a
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
statute limitations analysis for every
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
individual case to determine whether the
 
04:13:30.590 --> 04:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
discovery rule saves that individual
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
lawsuit so there is no easy an easy
 
04:13:39.469 --> 04:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.349 --> 04:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative Le uh
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
before the attorney General leaves uh
 
04:13:47.790 --> 04:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
obviously the Human Rights Commission is
 
04:13:49.710 --> 04:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
kind of under your jurisdiction and you
 
04:13:51.710 --> 04:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
are aware of the audit and they're
 
04:13:54.109 --> 04:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
coming before us uh I believe next do
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
you have any comments how we should
 
04:13:58.269 --> 04:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
proceed with the Human Rights Commission
 
04:14:00.070 --> 04:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
since they're kind of in embedded in
 
04:14:00.080 --> 04:14:00.870 align:start position:0%
since they're kind of in embedded in
your

04:14:00.870 --> 04:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:14:04.269 --> 04:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
department so I I was planning to stay
 
04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
for that and the the settlement fund
 
04:14:07.550 --> 04:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
presentation just because I figured you
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
may have questions but but I will I'll
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
take a quick shot at answering that
 
04:14:12.670 --> 04:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're not really embedded
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
Within our department they are
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to us which
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
means we handle we help them with some
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
HR and payroll and other sort of
 
04:14:23.229 --> 04:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
administrative things U but but in
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
addition to that I will say we are
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
councel for all agencies in state
 
04:14:29.109 --> 04:14:29.119 align:start position:0%
government so we do have a lawyer that's
 
04:14:31.870 --> 04:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
assigned to them to to help work through
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
these issues so I I'm aware of the
 
04:14:36.109 --> 04:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
issues there's a lot there that needs to
 
04:14:38.429 --> 04:14:38.439 align:start position:0%
be worked on we we take it very
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
seriously and and we want to work
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
through it but um but they're not
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
they're not I wouldn't say they're
 
04:14:46.109 --> 04:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
embedded with us or under our
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction because at the end of the
 
04:14:50.189 --> 04:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
day we might file at least a someone
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
who's not their counil in the office
 
04:14:53.469 --> 04:14:53.479 align:start position:0%
might be filing claims in the Human
 
04:14:54.750 --> 04:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission so they're they're
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
this they're a separate quasi
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
adjudicative body so they're not
 
04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
doj let me follow up with a slightly
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
more general question because we have a
 
04:15:10.349 --> 04:15:10.359 align:start position:0%
number of these kind of of agencies
 
04:15:13.149 --> 04:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
right we've got the btla we've got h
 
04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
we've got the pension the um employee
 
04:15:20.070 --> 04:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
relations uh board and all these kind of
 
04:15:22.389 --> 04:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
things that are these quas judicial
 
04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
things and I think in all cases people
 
04:15:27.870 --> 04:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
could go to court if they wanted to or
 
04:15:33.070 --> 04:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
they can go that way right um is your
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
general and from what we can tell
 
04:15:39.870 --> 04:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
financially the the they're very
 
04:15:42.189 --> 04:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
expensive they're not that cheap per
 
04:15:45.070 --> 04:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
case in in terms of our expenses there
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
may be cheap per case in terms of not
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
having an attorney and and and filing
 
04:15:53.149 --> 04:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
fee kind of things but but often these
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
these little boards are their expenses
 
04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
can be $110,000 a case or something like
 
04:16:03.389 --> 04:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
that so do you find do you have any
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
impression about how valuable these kind
 
04:16:07.870 --> 04:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
of things are or not do you anything you
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
want to say about them sure
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
um just just as a general matter one of
 
04:16:16.429 --> 04:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
the reasons to have some of these more
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
specialized boards is so that you have
 
04:16:21.710 --> 04:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
um people adjudicating the cases who
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
have an expertise in in a area that
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
might be unique right courts obviously
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
have to deal with every type of case so
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
I think one of the reasons these types
 
04:16:32.550 --> 04:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
of boards exist is for specialization
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
that said there could my impression is
 
04:16:39.070 --> 04:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
there are probably some efficiencies
 
04:16:41.070 --> 04:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
that that could be gained there but it's
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
something that I would be very to really
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
oine on off the top of my head but it
 
04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
may especially as the governor is
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
undertaking these efficiency efforts
 
04:16:50.109 --> 04:16:50.119 align:start position:0%
with the commission on government
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
efficiency I mean that type of thing I
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
think is a topic that that we could that
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
we as a as a state could be could be
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
looking at thank you so I think next
 
04:17:04.830 --> 04:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so um let me talk to
 
04:17:07.109 --> 04:17:07.119 align:start position:0%
Melissa we may or may not have to ask
 
04:17:09.790 --> 04:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
you back but I'm I'm definitely going to
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
try to
 
04:17:14.070 --> 04:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
get your data in a form that makes it
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
easier for us to see the history
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and happy to provide
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
feedback in response to any follow-up
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
written questions that often is is a
 
04:17:25.469 --> 04:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
very good way for us to make sure we're
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
getting you the information you you'd
 
04:17:29.790 --> 04:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
like to see yes thank you very much okay
 
04:17:32.750 --> 04:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
so let's take a couple of minutes and uh
 
04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
I want to talk to Melissa and then we'll
 
04:17:37.630 --> 04:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
who is coming next is it human rights
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.840 --> 04:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.760 --> 04:18:41.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.720 --> 04:19:11.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:06.670 --> 04:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:11.229 --> 04:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
288 I guess we're
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:22.590 --> 04:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
guess on page 288 we have the Human
 
04:20:22.600 --> 04:20:24.349 align:start position:0%
guess on page 288 we have the Human
Rights

04:20:24.349 --> 04:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
Commission representative Maguire yes um
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
are we missing human rights person isn't
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
here yet they thought they were coming
 
04:20:31.600 --> 04:20:32.389 align:start position:0%
here yet they thought they were coming
at

04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:20:34.349 --> 04:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
2:45 oh
 
04:20:37.389 --> 04:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
um Kathy can speak to the budget if you
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
want straight budget
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
questions from doj she she's prepared to
 
04:20:44.429 --> 04:20:44.439 align:start position:0%
speak to those but she wouldn't have the
 
04:20:46.830 --> 04:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
details of any maybe of the audit
 
04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
questions yeah just our our usual
 
04:20:51.389 --> 04:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
questions there's 15 people or any
 
04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.229 --> 04:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:09.670 --> 04:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:20.349 --> 04:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:20.359 --> 04:21:25.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
so apolog time wrong yeah apologies for
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
this um there was an initial email that
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
had gone out that had a different
 
04:21:38.510 --> 04:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
sequence of events and
 
04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
um so um Katrina tayor who is the acting
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
assistant director is was planning on
 
04:21:49.309 --> 04:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
the 2:30 time frame so she'll be she
 
04:21:52.510 --> 04:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
will be here so but I'm happy to answer
 
04:21:55.229 --> 04:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
any questions on the budget okay so
 
04:21:58.269 --> 04:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
there's 15 people um are any of these
 
04:22:03.389 --> 04:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
vacant and or unfunded yes so if um that
 
04:22:06.229 --> 04:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
we ended up we stayed Rel relatively
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
flat for the budget um we ended up
 
04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
unfund a full-time secretary and a
 
04:22:16.349 --> 04:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
part-time secretary position um and that
 
04:22:18.990 --> 04:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
saved about uh
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
94,000 in 26 and 98,000 in 27 and then
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
they were partially they had a little
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
small those two positions had federal
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
funds to help also so those went away um
 
04:22:41.229 --> 04:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
and then we did an offset of the general
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
funds um so the federal fund net was a
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
net increase um of what was estimated
 
04:22:50.670 --> 04:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
that the federal funds would be that
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
they would receive um so it ended up
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
reducing the um general
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
fund by about
 
04:23:06.189 --> 04:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
75,000 in 26 and about 20 something in
 
04:23:08.309 --> 04:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
right in uh 27 and I'm guessing there's
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
several vacant or at least there were in
 
04:23:13.830 --> 04:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
2024 because so I had um sent out a
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
vacancy list um there's two three four
 
04:23:20.429 --> 04:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
five so there's five uh
 
04:23:20.439 --> 04:23:22.030 align:start position:0%
five so there's five uh
full-time

04:23:22.030 --> 04:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
positions and one part-time position
 
04:23:28.510 --> 04:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
that is vacant at the
 
04:23:28.520 --> 04:23:32.149 align:start position:0%
that is vacant at the
moment

04:23:32.149 --> 04:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.229 --> 04:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
okay do you know in terms of the number
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
of cases they get per
 
04:23:42.149 --> 04:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
year um how many they they get new ones
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
and how many they close Old
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
ones I do not have that
 
04:23:54.429 --> 04:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
um current the current information okay
 
04:23:54.439 --> 04:23:57.229 align:start position:0%
um current the current information okay
for

04:23:57.229 --> 04:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:01.109 --> 04:24:01.119 align:start position:0%
that but we can send it to you if I
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
could Mr chairman they have I've got the
 
04:24:05.149 --> 04:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
audit that fiscal looked at a week or
 
04:24:09.750 --> 04:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
two ago and they've got like 259 cases
 
04:24:13.229 --> 04:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
pending uh how many
 
04:24:15.309 --> 04:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
or file each year doesn't say but they
 
04:24:19.229 --> 04:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
do have 259 pending and some of them are
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
older than two years
 
04:24:26.189 --> 04:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so I I like to know the flow
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
kind of more than
 
04:24:30.030 --> 04:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
the because some of them could be quite
 
04:24:32.269 --> 04:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
old right so yeah there quite a few that
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
are okay
 
04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
um and they're in RSA 354a apparently is
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
so I haven't um had a chance to look at
 
04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
that audit so what I just hear it's so
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
horrible so what specifically has
 
04:25:05.229 --> 04:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.239 --> 04:25:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
microphone a lot of the cases took
 
04:25:15.149 --> 04:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
almost three years and then there was a
 
04:25:16.830 --> 04:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
section in the back where the people
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
that had appeared before it were asked
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
to appear to to write it criticism and
 
04:25:23.590 --> 04:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
there were several that said you know it
 
04:25:25.790 --> 04:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
was worthless going there because you
 
04:25:28.349 --> 04:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
lost the time lawyer someone would ask
 
04:25:30.790 --> 04:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
for a lawyer the lawyer would file the
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
case there some of them would say if I
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything in a year I'll
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
file them in the court because otherwise
 
04:25:40.469 --> 04:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
after three years you can't file so then
 
04:25:41.830 --> 04:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
you've exceeded the statute of
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
limitation so from one of the the
 
04:25:46.590 --> 04:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
criticism where everything was took too
 
04:25:49.349 --> 04:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
much time he might file a case and not
 
04:25:51.910 --> 04:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
here for a year whether anything was
 
04:25:55.269 --> 04:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
done and then two years go by and now
 
04:25:58.030 --> 04:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
they're finally calling for Witnesses
 
04:26:00.269 --> 04:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
and they don't even interview all the
 
04:26:03.070 --> 04:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
witnesses that were put in the in the
 
04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
claim so there was a lot of complaints
 
04:26:11.070 --> 04:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
about incomplete and and uh hastiness
 
04:26:15.870 --> 04:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
and and lots of delays so and Justice
 
04:26:17.790 --> 04:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
delayed is Justice denied that kind of
 
04:26:20.429 --> 04:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
thing that state I'd like to add that
 
04:26:23.790 --> 04:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
20% of their cases went beyond the
 
04:26:23.800 --> 04:26:24.790 align:start position:0%
20% of their cases went beyond the
threeyear

04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
threeyear
 
04:26:28.349 --> 04:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations which preluded
 
04:26:28.359 --> 04:26:29.309 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations which preluded
those

04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:26:33.229 --> 04:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:36.429 --> 04:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
court thing was really counterproductive
 
04:26:45.429 --> 04:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
so is this one of those things where
 
04:26:51.710 --> 04:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
um you get to decide when you have a
 
04:26:53.950 --> 04:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
such a case you either go Superior Court
 
04:26:56.750 --> 04:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
or you go here and from here you can go
 
04:26:58.790 --> 04:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court is that the or
 
04:27:02.189 --> 04:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
super period yeah I mean to appeal if
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to appeal yeah okay all
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
right um and it how many what fraction
 
04:27:10.750 --> 04:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
of their cases they do both housing and
 
04:27:13.870 --> 04:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
employment right was like almost 90%
 
04:27:13.880 --> 04:27:14.950 align:start position:0%
employment right was like almost 90%
were

04:27:14.950 --> 04:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:27:21.870 --> 04:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:24.269 --> 04:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
okay I think he's got if he's got it
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
diagram there a circle diagram showing
 
04:27:37.229 --> 04:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
how many yeah I can chairman wer is
 
04:27:40.109 --> 04:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
correct uh housing accounted for nine
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
cases 3.5
 
04:27:46.510 --> 04:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
% public accommodations 20
 
04:27:51.790 --> 04:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
cases public education three cases
 
04:27:51.800 --> 04:27:53.309 align:start position:0%
cases public education three cases
employment

04:27:53.309 --> 04:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:27:58.870 --> 04:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
227 cases I see I see I see gotta so
 
04:28:02.830 --> 04:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's almost all employment okay
 
04:28:07.030 --> 04:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.040 --> 04:28:09.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:28:09.149 --> 04:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:11.349 --> 04:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
clearly it seemed to me thinking about
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
this that
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General is really
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
not overseeing these people right I mean
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's like administratively attached
 
04:28:22.469 --> 04:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
they're just sort of I want to go get my
 
04:28:27.550 --> 04:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
copy of the the audit okay and so I mean
 
04:28:27.560 --> 04:28:28.309 align:start position:0%
copy of the the audit okay and so I mean
we

04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:28:30.510 --> 04:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
could and and clearly something should
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
be done with to make it better right so
 
04:28:36.269 --> 04:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
well there was an attorney that was uh
 
04:28:38.990 --> 04:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
they sent out requests for comments from
 
04:28:40.590 --> 04:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
different people and there was one
 
04:28:42.630 --> 04:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
particular comment that
 
04:28:44.510 --> 04:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
struck me that one attorney had been
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
practicing before them for as many as 20
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
years and his comments where um the
 
04:28:54.149 --> 04:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
commission's investigation process has
 
04:28:57.389 --> 04:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
been in my opinion terrible in the past
 
04:28:59.710 --> 04:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
years and he said he's been practicing
 
04:29:02.429 --> 04:29:02.439 align:start position:0%
or she before them for 20 years so this
 
04:29:05.429 --> 04:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
has been a long on ongoing problem and
 
04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
again as it LBA pointed out the cost is
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars for and yeah yeah
 
04:29:13.950 --> 04:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
it's some point you know changes
 
04:29:16.830 --> 04:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
obviously need to be made or yeah right
 
04:29:20.870 --> 04:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
so so the first decision is do we want
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
this you know non-judicial judicial
 
04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
function to exist right do we or do we
 
04:29:28.830 --> 04:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
we just want to say to these people go
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
to court right which is their option
 
04:29:35.349 --> 04:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
which yes representative evil so I guess
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
the thing that I struggle with is if the
 
04:29:41.710 --> 04:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
failure of the commission to do the work
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
it needs to
 
04:29:46.510 --> 04:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
do is because they are
 
04:29:46.520 --> 04:29:48.229 align:start position:0%
do is because they are
chronically

04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
chronically
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
underfunded because I I just remember
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
them coming in there you know the
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
director was trying to do secretarial
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
duties or you know there was just a lot
 
04:30:03.870 --> 04:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
of and so it's hard to unwind how much
 
04:30:06.109 --> 04:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
the The Chronic
 
04:30:09.189 --> 04:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
underfunding uh is the cause of these
 
04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
problems and how much just their
 
04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
management skills are part of the
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
problem I mean I it's it's really hard
 
04:30:19.950 --> 04:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
for us to unwind those two things so if
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments is underfunding and
 
04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
if they've been underfunded by millions
 
04:30:27.389 --> 04:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
of dollars how much money would it
 
04:30:30.189 --> 04:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
actually take to get them so they were
 
04:30:32.790 --> 04:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
functioning and it might
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
be way more than than we have I mean
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
maybe you guys have an opinion on that
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
but that's just what I I hate to really
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
call them on the carpet if they haven't
 
04:30:45.429 --> 04:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
G been given the tools to do what they
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
need to do I believe in the last budget
 
04:30:50.790 --> 04:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
we gave them more than they had
 
04:30:52.510 --> 04:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
requested because it was one of their
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs to have at least four
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
additional people now whether those
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
people were hired or not but we did
 
04:31:03.109 --> 04:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
provide more investigative funding yeah
 
04:31:05.149 --> 04:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
so the question even then was you know
 
04:31:07.149 --> 04:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
they had to dig themselves out of such a
 
04:31:09.750 --> 04:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
hole but anyway I just wanted to to
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
raise that sure
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay so so my so the first question
 
04:31:21.269 --> 04:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
is we can say to these just get rid of
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
it and then people go to court right
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
which is sort of the normal they could
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
also go to the federal equal employment
 
04:31:29.950 --> 04:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity commission which is the
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
federal funds that come in when they
 
04:31:34.349 --> 04:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
finish a case they do get money from the
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
equal employment opportunity commission
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
but anyone could go to them initially is
 
04:31:44.189 --> 04:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:52.109 --> 04:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
Court I guess it well this is probably
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
one of those situations where it's both
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
against federal law and against state
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
law to discriminate right and so
 
04:32:03.790 --> 04:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
somebody could decide I'm going fed
 
04:32:06.429 --> 04:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
versus I'm going state right so yeah
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
yeah but the whole the whole idea of
 
04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
this this group right this division was
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
to speed things up all right and make it
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
less costly speed it up so you wouldn't
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
have to go to court and you wouldn't
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
have to get in line and wait and based
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
on the audit report and the history of
 
04:32:33.109 --> 04:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
it it's just the opposite they're
 
04:32:36.750 --> 04:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
actually taking so long that 20% of
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
their cases end up end up being
 
04:32:42.030 --> 04:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
precluded from going to court because
 
04:32:45.389 --> 04:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
the statue of limitations is run so we
 
04:32:48.429 --> 04:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
have a group here or a division here
 
04:32:50.910 --> 04:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
that's counterproductive to the reason
 
04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
they were originally set
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
up so an interesting fact Mr chairman is
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh on page 14 of the audit as of
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
February of
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
2025 the commission had
 
04:33:08.830 --> 04:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
21 authorized positions of which 12 were
 
04:33:08.840 --> 04:33:10.429 align:start position:0%
21 authorized positions of which 12 were
vacant

04:33:10.429 --> 04:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
04:33:13.150 --> 04:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
so why they not filling those positions
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
is obviously leading to the delays
 
04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's maybe yeah okay so and out of the
 
04:33:26.510 --> 04:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
21 positions six were added by the
 
04:33:29.789 --> 04:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
legislature in 20124 so there were six
 
04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
we gave them six new positions not four
 
04:33:34.990 --> 04:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier well but in the book
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
it says 15 I know that's why there's
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
obviously some not there's a mix up
 
04:33:44.109 --> 04:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
there somewhere but I guess so there's
 
04:33:46.029 --> 04:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
there's some temporary part-time
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
positions that they may be including
 
04:33:53.551 --> 04:33:53.561 align:start position:0%
um there were a few temporary part-time
 
04:33:56.310 --> 04:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
not full-time you're right positions and
 
04:33:59.150 --> 04:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
those are not included there also some
 
04:34:01.150 --> 04:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
criticism of the investigators didn't
 
04:34:03.109 --> 04:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
know how to
 
04:34:05.349 --> 04:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
investigate yeah so you're right if you
 
04:34:10.670 --> 04:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
look on page 289 on line 50 um it looks
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
like we budged it 130,000 for um for
 
04:34:17.789 --> 04:34:17.799 align:start position:0%
temps in the last budget and they only
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
used 30 right so there's a lot of people
 
04:34:24.269 --> 04:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
they could have hired for that as
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
well okay well so so again the one
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
choice is get rid of it tell people to
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
go to court um the other would be to to
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
put them under the agis of somebody else
 
04:34:41.439 --> 04:34:42.230 align:start position:0%
put them under the agis of somebody else
right

04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
who and and so that they could have a
 
04:34:47.349 --> 04:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
boss right and they could have somebody
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
who's um who's running it um who who
 
04:34:55.349 --> 04:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
could be uh related and maybe be a
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
better management um person over the
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
um yes so the two I thought of that's
 
04:35:10.150 --> 04:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
one right one is the Labor Department
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
right most of these cases have to do
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
with labor um I spoke to the Labor
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
Commissioner he would be willing to take
 
04:35:23.869 --> 04:35:23.879 align:start position:0%
this on as a as a task um and presumably
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
we do it in a way that he can uh hire
 
04:35:29.789 --> 04:35:29.799 align:start position:0%
the people he wants to hire to to do
 
04:35:31.869 --> 04:35:31.879 align:start position:0%
this job
 
04:35:35.830 --> 04:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
um but uh that's one possibility the
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
other one that occurred to me as we were
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
going through our hearings was the um
 
04:35:44.709 --> 04:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
that Labor Relations
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
Board um they have that board that does
 
04:35:51.590 --> 04:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh um labor cases right but those are
 
04:35:53.429 --> 04:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
those are
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
um those are union type type cases right
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
and these are discrimination maybe it's
 
04:36:02.029 --> 04:36:02.039 align:start position:0%
not as great a fit it's just my
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
impression of that board was I really
 
04:36:08.590 --> 04:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
liked their structure their structure of
 
04:36:10.990 --> 04:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
that board is that they have those nine
 
04:36:11.000 --> 04:36:12.789 align:start position:0%
that board is that they have those nine
experts

04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
experts
 
04:36:15.629 --> 04:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
right three attorneys three of this and
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
three three labor experts and three of
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
that and whenever they decide a case
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
they say okay give me one attorney give
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
me one labor expert give me one of these
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
right and those three people form a
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
little board to decide a case and and it
 
04:36:31.789 --> 04:36:31.799 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that was a very efficient
 
04:36:35.949 --> 04:36:35.959 align:start position:0%
way to do things but that particular
 
04:36:38.670 --> 04:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
group had four employees and they're
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
only doing like a 100 cases a year so
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
seemed to me they were a little um
 
04:36:45.480 --> 04:36:47.150 align:start position:0%
seemed to me they were a little um
overstaffed

04:36:47.150 --> 04:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
overstaffed
 
04:36:50.750 --> 04:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
for for the workers part of it right so
 
04:36:53.070 --> 04:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
that they might have with with some
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
additions they might have some extra
 
04:36:57.551 --> 04:36:57.561 align:start position:0%
capacity so that that was the other
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
possibility that or the labor department
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to
 
04:37:05.390 --> 04:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
continue this um this activity you know
 
04:37:08.029 --> 04:37:08.039 align:start position:0%
give it another shot basically send them
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
to the feds yeah or send them to yeah
 
04:37:13.510 --> 04:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
just say no right I mean you
 
04:37:13.520 --> 04:37:16.150 align:start position:0%
just say no right I mean you
know

04:37:16.150 --> 04:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:37:19.470 --> 04:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
hi we're sorry about the timing the
 
04:37:24.230 --> 04:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
scheduling problem no I'm very sorry
 
04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
very sorry no it's our fault I think so
 
04:37:30.189 --> 04:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon uh my name is Katrina
 
04:37:32.830 --> 04:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you for this opportunity um
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
I am temporarily the acting assistant
 
04:37:37.750 --> 04:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
director um so I was just here to
 
04:37:39.551 --> 04:37:39.561 align:start position:0%
present on behalf of Annie who could not
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
be here today um so I'm happy I don't
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
know how far you've gotten but happy to
 
04:37:46.990 --> 04:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
answer yeah we've been talking about the
 
04:37:50.109 --> 04:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
the audit that came out of your agency
 
04:37:52.830 --> 04:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
and um do you want to respond I mean it
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
it it shows a lot of problems basically
 
04:37:58.429 --> 04:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
so I unfortunately can't respond on
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
behalf of the commission I know I can
 
04:38:03.310 --> 04:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
say that on behalf of current staff and
 
04:38:04.830 --> 04:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
myself and the Commissioners that I've
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
spoken to we've already taken many steps
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
to address some of the things that were
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
brought up in the audit even before the
 
04:38:13.269 --> 04:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
audit report came out um so we have
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
already gone underway with that um we
 
04:38:17.590 --> 04:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with many of the
 
04:38:19.750 --> 04:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations and we really think we
 
04:38:23.189 --> 04:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
are confident uh that we could achieve
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
that okay um now why have you been um
 
04:38:32.551 --> 04:38:32.561 align:start position:0%
you you you have 15 um U positions
 
04:38:35.470 --> 04:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
available but but you're you're only at
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
like two-third
 
04:38:39.869 --> 04:38:39.879 align:start position:0%
strength yes so most of these vacancies
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
became vacant before I became Act in
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
assistant director so I have put in
 
04:38:46.709 --> 04:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
hiring waiver requests as um with the
 
04:38:49.070 --> 04:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner's approval um to fill these
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
positions because once again I believe
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
fully staffed we are going to you'll see
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
a significant change in how things are
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
processed but this the the these have
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
been in the budget at least a year and a
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
half already they were full yes filled
 
04:39:10.269 --> 04:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
every right so all of the positions were
 
04:39:14.429 --> 04:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
filled at one time except for one um
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
vacancy dates are
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
May last May October two in
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
October pass yeah one in December and
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
one in June um so they were all at one
 
04:39:31.470 --> 04:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
time full except for one position um I
 
04:39:33.551 --> 04:39:33.561 align:start position:0%
just wanted to so in that case when
 
04:39:37.470 --> 04:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
they're full why do we have some cases
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
going on for years so again I want to go
 
04:39:43.150 --> 04:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
back to the backlog that was referenced
 
04:39:46.350 --> 04:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
in the audit report um there was a Mis
 
04:39:48.030 --> 04:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
clarification I think because there are
 
04:39:50.190 --> 04:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
no cases from the 1980s that are
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
currently open with the commission I
 
04:39:53.470 --> 04:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
want to make that very clear um a
 
04:39:55.948 --> 04:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
backlog which means an a list of cases
 
04:39:58.350 --> 04:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
waiting to be assigned uh that's what we
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
Define as a backlog has existed since
 
04:40:04.150 --> 04:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
before I was born um so that was a
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
historical issue now when the more cases
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
come in and when our budget got cut I
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
believe it was in 2011 they were down to
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
for investigators so they already had a
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
backlog and then the staff was cut and
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
then we were able to get some more staff
 
04:40:21.550 --> 04:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um and we've seen a reduction
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
but we obviously keep getting a flurry
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
of cases um our case numbers have gone
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
up over 60% in the past five years um
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
just as an example for this year alone
 
04:40:34.110 --> 04:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
we do statistics federally by our
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year so I go October to
 
04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
September so we're we're only four
 
04:40:40.750 --> 04:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
months through and we have already had a
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
third of cases filed this year than we
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
had total in 2024 so the number of cases
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
that are coming in is a significant
 
04:40:50.430 --> 04:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
number it's still they're coming in and
 
04:40:53.310 --> 04:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
we are processing them as best as we can
 
04:40:56.350 --> 04:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
all right how many cases came in in 2024
 
04:40:56.360 --> 04:40:57.230 align:start position:0%
all right how many cases came in in 2024
in

04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
2024 I think I have that on me I want to
 
04:41:00.480 --> 04:41:06.470 align:start position:0%
2024 I think I have that on me I want to
say

04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
285 yeah all total 285 were filed in
 
04:41:17.230 --> 04:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
243 okay and how much um hours of work
 
04:41:27.030 --> 04:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
does a typical case take I don't know if
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
I could put a qualitative number on it
 
04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
because it's a caseby casee basis the
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
problem that we that I've seen in my
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
historical time with the commission um
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
is the length of time that is the
 
04:41:40.750 --> 04:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
problematic is that time that it's
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
waiting to to get assigned to someone so
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
we docket it right away we process it we
 
04:41:48.670 --> 04:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
notice uh the respondent and then that
 
04:41:51.230 --> 04:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
sitting process is the year and the half
 
04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
process that's usually referenced um
 
04:41:57.670 --> 04:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
because we're processing those um case
 
04:42:00.150 --> 04:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh my investigators they process cases
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
they get an evolving case load it's not
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
like they close 25 in a year and they're
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
done they constantly as soon as they
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
close some they're getting more it's
 
04:42:10.830 --> 04:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
just constant um so the investigation
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
part could take anywhere from two months
 
04:42:16.990 --> 04:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
to 12 months on average um if cause is
 
04:42:18.990 --> 04:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
found then it goes to a legal procedure
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
which could lengthen the St state of the
 
04:42:25.270 --> 04:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
case so why why two months I mean two
 
04:42:27.788 --> 04:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
months it all depends on the case that's
 
04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
if both parties might agree to settle
 
04:42:31.628 --> 04:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
the case when an investigator gets
 
04:42:33.470 --> 04:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
assigned they're like maybe we don't
 
04:42:35.550 --> 04:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
want to keep producing documentation
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't want to extend this any
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
longer maybe we can resolve this we get
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of that when it first gets
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
assigned to an
 
04:42:45.430 --> 04:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
investigator um it could be a matter of
 
04:42:47.948 --> 04:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
there's enough evidence there to say hey
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
yes this is probable cause we need to
 
04:42:51.470 --> 04:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
move it forward or vice versa that
 
04:42:53.070 --> 04:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence and it's very
 
04:42:55.390 --> 04:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
apparent when you first get that case
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
Okay sometimes there's an attorney that
 
04:42:59.948 --> 04:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
would like to file an amendment uh they
 
04:43:02.110 --> 04:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
would like to request documentation they
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
request extensions proa parties request
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
extensions as well um and we've been in
 
04:43:09.628 --> 04:43:09.638 align:start position:0%
historically pretty lenient on allowing
 
04:43:12.070 --> 04:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
those things to happen
 
04:43:15.310 --> 04:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
does the most of the claimants have
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
attorneys or no I don't I wouldn't say
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
most um a good portion do but I think
 
04:43:23.190 --> 04:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
the reason why they come to us is
 
04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
because they don't need an attorney to
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
go through our process it's much more
 
04:43:30.270 --> 04:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
clearcut than a court process is okay
 
04:43:32.910 --> 04:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
and and all right just a moment and and
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
one last question you so you're saying
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
that your your um backlog grew by 42
 
04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
cases in 2024 how much is the backlog
 
04:43:46.550 --> 04:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
today uh as of today because like I
 
04:43:49.110 --> 04:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that increase um our backlog
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
is up to
 
04:43:54.350 --> 04:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
395 okay there was over 100 cases filed
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
in just the month of November this uh
 
04:43:57.470 --> 04:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
this past
 
04:44:01.270 --> 04:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
yearz um say mostly employment uh that
 
04:44:03.150 --> 04:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
month it was public accommodation was
 
04:44:05.708 --> 04:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
the number one um but generally we do
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
mostly employment um because especially
 
04:44:12.150 --> 04:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
with our EEOC contract
 
04:44:15.470 --> 04:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
and um all right uh representative wer
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
then representative Camp what's the most
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
common U comp point on the employment
 
04:44:22.830 --> 04:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
charges and how are they usually
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
resolved in regards to on the basis as
 
04:44:28.350 --> 04:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
in disability
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
age is that what what's most common
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
disability discrimination is most common
 
04:44:35.070 --> 04:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
I would say what was that disability
 
04:44:37.830 --> 04:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination yes and how was it
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
usually resolved uh that all depends on
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
the parties so I see we have a great
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
mediation program um we resolve at least
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
probably 30 to 40 cases just with that
 
04:44:49.830 --> 04:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
program alone per year um so that's
 
04:44:51.788 --> 04:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
voluntary settlement my investigators
 
04:44:53.628 --> 04:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
also facilitate settlement
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
discussions um but those are resolved
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
through investigation we'll have to
 
04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
determine the legal standard if somebody
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know asked for a reasonable
 
04:45:03.628 --> 04:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
condation that was denied whether that
 
04:45:03.638 --> 04:45:04.350 align:start position:0%
condation that was denied whether that
was

04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:45:06.990 --> 04:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable um and that would either be a
 
04:45:09.990 --> 04:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
no cause or a probable cause is this the
 
04:45:11.470 --> 04:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
sort of thing like you're asking me to
 
04:45:13.830 --> 04:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
carry 50 pounds up two flights for an
 
04:45:16.110 --> 04:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
example yes and you have a doctor's note
 
04:45:19.390 --> 04:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
that says you could not do that okay so
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
person either doesn't get that Duty or
 
04:45:24.910 --> 04:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
gets another Duty right that would be
 
04:45:27.270 --> 04:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
considered potentially reasonable
 
04:45:29.948 --> 04:45:29.958 align:start position:0%
representative Camal thank you Mr chair
 
04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you were working the
 
04:45:34.270 --> 04:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
department was working to fix issues
 
04:45:36.670 --> 04:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
before the audit and and as a result of
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
some of the inputs of the audit do you
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a formal corrective action plan
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
plan and that's something that we can
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
see uh so we can see what the issues
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
were and what your corrective actions
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
are for that so it is my belief that the
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
executive director is was planning on
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
submitting such or responding to such
 
04:45:58.830 --> 04:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
and she is on leave so I do know that
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
the com current Commissioners are in
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
discussions about the response to do
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
that um I don't currently have the
 
04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
authority because I wasn't there for you
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
know in management during this audit
 
04:46:09.920 --> 04:46:11.990 align:start position:0%
know in management during this audit
period

04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:46:15.990 --> 04:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead so it is there a corrective
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
action plan going on right now I mean I
 
04:46:20.550 --> 04:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
can attest to things that we've been
 
04:46:22.590 --> 04:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
doing in office we've updated our
 
04:46:24.390 --> 04:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
training manuals we've done more of a
 
04:46:26.670 --> 04:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive internal making sure our
 
04:46:28.830 --> 04:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
resources are updated making sure our
 
04:46:31.310 --> 04:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
legal resources are updated um I am in
 
04:46:33.390 --> 04:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
the process of working with our attorney
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
general's office to um update our
 
04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
administrative rules as well I'm
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with how that process works
 
04:46:41.548 --> 04:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking to learn that within the
 
04:46:44.110 --> 04:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
next week or so okay my experience in
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
industry is that rather than do the
 
04:46:49.030 --> 04:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
whack-a-mole approach is you have a
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
formal corrective action plan that way
 
04:46:53.548 --> 04:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
everything is documented and you don't
 
04:46:56.430 --> 04:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
repeat the same mistakes and you so I I
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
would highly is my understanding that
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners who again they have
 
04:47:01.750 --> 04:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
the oversight I believe they are working
 
04:47:04.830 --> 04:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
on that okay thank you representative
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
lean thank you Mr chairman U welcome so
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of the items do date back to 20
 
04:47:13.590 --> 04:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
2008 like one of the concerns was the
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
members weren't filing financial
 
04:47:18.670 --> 04:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
statements which still haven't been done
 
04:47:21.310 --> 04:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh which is troubling to me that we all
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
have to file financial statements and
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
and yet the commission appears to be
 
04:47:28.110 --> 04:47:28.120 align:start position:0%
lacking in that way but more to the
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
point um and to some of the other
 
04:47:32.948 --> 04:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
questions what other options do people
 
04:47:34.708 --> 04:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
have if the New Hampshire Human Rights
 
04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
Commission isn't there can they go to
 
04:47:38.948 --> 04:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
the federal government can they go to
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
court for instance Superior Court and
 
04:47:44.190 --> 04:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
file a complaint there so as our statute
 
04:47:46.750 --> 04:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
is written um and first of all I'm sorry
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
I cannot attest to anything the
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners anything managerial
 
04:47:53.070 --> 04:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't speak too um I can
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
answer your question about where folks
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
could go if an employer has 15 or more
 
04:48:01.310 --> 04:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
employees they could file potentially
 
04:48:02.470 --> 04:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
with the federal government with the
 
04:48:05.230 --> 04:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
equal employment opportunity commission
 
04:48:07.788 --> 04:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
um if they have a housing complaint so
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
anything so New Hampshire I'm sorry just
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
to clarify New Hampshire's log in
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination um protects in employees
 
04:48:17.430 --> 04:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
with six or more so in New Hampshire you
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
need six or more employees to file a
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
complaint um for housing they could file
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh with the with HUD um I do not believe
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
there is an alternative as of right now
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
the way their statute's written for
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
public educ I'm sorry for public
 
04:48:36.110 --> 04:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
accommodation I believe public education
 
04:48:38.590 --> 04:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to go straight
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
to Superior Court so or the Department
 
04:48:44.670 --> 04:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
of Education I believe so there would be
 
04:48:47.868 --> 04:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
other options without changing statute
 
04:48:50.110 --> 04:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
without changing statute for certain
 
04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
things so right now our statute um
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
requires the administrative exhaustion
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
you are required to file with us and
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
then you may remove your case to court
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay thanks thank you Mr chairman
 
04:49:03.548 --> 04:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
representative evil so um yeah just sort
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
of following along his thought chain so
 
04:49:10.708 --> 04:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
if you have so the federal statute
 
04:49:12.750 --> 04:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
statute says that if you have 15 or more
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
employees you can go to the EEOC our
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
statute says if you have six or more so
 
04:49:22.670 --> 04:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a gap there so if the
 
04:49:24.910 --> 04:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
HRC didn't
 
04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
exist that group of people wouldn't have
 
04:49:32.430 --> 04:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
recourse except to go to court or no
 
04:49:35.310 --> 04:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
recourse unless the statute was amended
 
04:49:37.070 --> 04:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
right now the way the statute is written
 
04:49:39.628 --> 04:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
they would still have to file with us so
 
04:49:42.270 --> 04:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
if there was that not that requirement I
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
believe they could file in court they
 
04:49:48.750 --> 04:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
would civil and so the reason that
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
somebody would choose to come before you
 
04:49:54.190 --> 04:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
folks is that um going through Superior
 
04:49:56.190 --> 04:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
Court is more complex and they would
 
04:49:58.708 --> 04:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
feel the need for an attorney or some
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:50:01.708 --> 04:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
representation that's generally the
 
04:50:04.230 --> 04:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
feedback that we've received is that our
 
04:50:07.470 --> 04:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
process is more uh clear on what the
 
04:50:09.230 --> 04:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
expectations are and how to go through
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
it and um mostly it is more timely the
 
04:50:14.670 --> 04:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
investigative process is still more
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
timely than a court trial if you went to
 
04:50:18.830 --> 04:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
a full
 
04:50:22.510 --> 04:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
trial and if people come before the
 
04:50:25.548 --> 04:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission and they do want
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
an attorney do they tend to need go to
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights I mean the civil
 
04:50:33.750 --> 04:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
litigation sort of folks that come
 
04:50:35.708 --> 04:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
within the judicial Council for
 
04:50:38.548 --> 04:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
representation or don't you know I'm not
 
04:50:40.750 --> 04:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
sure just just generally the employment
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
we have members of the employment bar I
 
04:50:44.070 --> 04:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
see practice a lot before us okay thank
 
04:50:46.430 --> 04:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
you do you tell people when they show up
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
that they're going to wait a year and a
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
half before you absolutely we say you
 
04:50:52.510 --> 04:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
know unfortunately due to our processing
 
04:50:54.750 --> 04:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
and our staffing um it may be quite some
 
04:50:56.830 --> 04:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
time before your case is assigned
 
04:50:58.510 --> 04:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
obviously you can reach out at any time
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
again we offer mediation at any time it
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to wait till you get
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
assigned um and we have a nice success
 
04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
rate on that program and your
 
04:51:08.310 --> 04:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of the regular court
 
04:51:10.110 --> 04:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
process is it's longer than a year and a
 
04:51:12.548 --> 04:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
half from what I have heard I am not
 
04:51:14.110 --> 04:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's not my you
 
04:51:19.110 --> 04:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
know gotcha all right other questions no
 
04:51:21.190 --> 04:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
I just I just have a comment I mean to
 
04:51:24.628 --> 04:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
the extent that the HRC goes away or
 
04:51:27.270 --> 04:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller uh appell boards
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about it does
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
put in a larger burden on the courts so
 
04:51:35.788 --> 04:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
if you pull one threat the sweater might
 
04:51:38.910 --> 04:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
start to ra unravel a little bit so I
 
04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
just think when we're talking about
 
04:51:42.868 --> 04:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
resources are right no no no I know I'm
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
not all I'm saying is that if we're
 
04:51:46.670 --> 04:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
talking about these things we have to
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
think about the whole pie yes and the
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
effect on the on the courts that are
 
04:51:54.628 --> 04:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
already struggling okay all right well
 
04:51:58.110 --> 04:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um Miss Taylor thank
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.120 --> 04:52:05.070 align:start position:0%
 
2:45

04:52:05.070 --> 04:52:05.080 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%

yourself good
 
04:53:24.548 --> 04:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Jen Foley I'm
 
04:53:26.548 --> 04:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
general counsel for administrator brri
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the claims Administration process um
 
04:53:30.990 --> 04:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
the administrator wishes that he could
 
04:53:32.190 --> 04:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
have been here today and really
 
04:53:35.230 --> 04:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
appreciates the invitation uh he has two
 
04:53:37.430 --> 04:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
hearings with claimants today which he
 
04:53:39.670 --> 04:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
um performs regularly it's about his
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
sixth uh um sixth hearing just this week
 
04:53:44.830 --> 04:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
um so he does that on a weekly basis so
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes his schedule's a little bit
 
04:53:50.070 --> 04:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
tight now is the the budget that runs
 
04:53:53.788 --> 04:53:53.798 align:start position:0%
your office in here somewhere or not
 
04:53:58.430 --> 04:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's not um the fund itself um pays for
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
um our operations um that budget um
 
04:54:04.390 --> 04:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
because we're actually a little bit
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
hybrid we are employed officially by the
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
judicial branch even though we operate
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
separate and independent from the
 
04:54:11.310 --> 04:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and then the uh we put together a
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
budget and we bring that to the attorney
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
general himself um who reviews the
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
budget for our claims Administration
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
operations and ultimately um we uh those
 
04:54:25.628 --> 04:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
operations are paid directly from the

04:56:31.920 --> 04:56:32.868 align:start position:0%
which I'm happy to walk through okay go
ahead

04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
04:56:35.948 --> 04:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm here to give observations
 
04:56:37.750 --> 04:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
about the status of the fund right now
 
04:56:40.390 --> 04:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
particularly for fiscal year 2025 and
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
focusing specifically on the 60 million
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
um dollars that was um funded um as of
 
04:56:48.990 --> 04:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
the statutory amendments um I'm also
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
here to address division one questions
 
04:56:53.948 --> 04:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
which we received last week so as some
 
04:56:56.390 --> 04:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
context there's four categories uh that
 
04:57:00.670 --> 04:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
draw down from the fund one is resolved
 
04:57:02.830 --> 04:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
claims with awards from the
 
04:57:05.150 --> 04:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
administrator's final decision he
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
reviews and evaluates Awards and issues
 
04:57:09.150 --> 04:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
a decision which is either an award or
 
04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
not an award the second category of draw
 
04:57:14.910 --> 04:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
down is resolved claims with agreed upon
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
amounts through the Attorney General's
 
04:57:18.990 --> 04:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
office so the Attorney General's office
 
04:57:20.750 --> 04:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
and claims councel if they're
 
04:57:22.830 --> 04:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
represented and mostly they are um can
 
04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
resolve the claim on their own and then
 
04:57:27.548 --> 04:57:27.558 align:start position:0%
submit that resolution um to our process
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
for it to be paid under the
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
fund the third category is that category
 
04:57:36.030 --> 04:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
because the Attorney General was in
 
04:57:40.190 --> 04:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
court with with this claimant and they
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
settled out of court is that kind
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
of where that second category comes from
 
04:57:47.670 --> 04:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
a actually the statute itself the
 
04:57:50.548 --> 04:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
settlement fund statute itself um is an
 
04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
entire ecosystem of settlement um to
 
04:57:55.788 --> 04:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
draw folks out of Courts and to come
 
04:57:57.350 --> 04:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
into the administrative settlement
 
04:57:59.708 --> 04:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
process so by Statute it lays out
 
04:58:01.470 --> 04:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
plainly that there are two ways to
 
04:58:04.590 --> 04:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
resolve a claim through settlement one
 
04:58:06.310 --> 04:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
is to go through the administrator's
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation and two they could otherwise
 
04:58:11.190 --> 04:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
go before for the Attorney General's
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
office and directly negotiate a
 
04:58:15.390 --> 04:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
settlement that way either way the claim
 
04:58:17.708 --> 04:58:17.718 align:start position:0%
is submitted to our office uh we do
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
intake make sure the claim fil is
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
complete um and then this what we call
 
04:58:24.750 --> 04:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
stipulated agreements um to the extent
 
04:58:25.990 --> 04:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
that they come up with a negotiated
 
04:58:28.510 --> 04:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
resolution would come before our office
 
04:58:29.868 --> 04:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
we review it to make sure all the
 
04:58:32.070 --> 04:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
essential terms are there um and then we
 
04:58:34.270 --> 04:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
would approve for payment processing so
 
04:58:36.910 --> 04:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
the statute itself lays out two uh
 
04:58:39.868 --> 04:58:39.878 align:start position:0%
Pathways to settlement resolution I see
 
04:58:43.110 --> 04:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay and and do we have a count like
 
04:58:47.910 --> 04:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
which way we sure do so the uh letter
 
04:58:49.470 --> 04:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
that was given to the attorney general
 
04:58:52.470 --> 04:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
earlier this week that we copied you on
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
um attachment a um not only lays out um
 
04:58:59.070 --> 04:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
the a projection for the $60 million
 
04:59:01.150 --> 04:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
which we see is insufficient for fiscal
 
04:59:04.350 --> 04:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
year 2025 at the end of it it it
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
identifies a snapshot of our most
 
04:59:09.350 --> 04:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
recently cly report and it shows us the
 
04:59:11.628 --> 04:59:11.638 align:start position:0%
claim count of resolutions as of
 
04:59:15.390 --> 04:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2024 and breaks out the
 
04:59:16.990 --> 04:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
distinction so I'll give you the numbers
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
if that would be helpful go ahead so
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
total claims resolved through the
 
04:59:23.470 --> 04:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
settlement um with payment through the
 
04:59:25.510 --> 04:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
fund is
 
04:59:29.470 --> 04:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
2024 148 of those claims were through
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
the stipulated agreement mutual
 
04:59:35.948 --> 04:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
agreement directly with the Attorney
 
04:59:39.150 --> 04:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
General's office 94 of them had gone
 
04:59:41.470 --> 04:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
through the uh process the resolution
 
04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:47.868 --> 04:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
himself if helpful I can make sure to
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
get a copy of that Cory report to you
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
yes please so I'm I'm not getting the
 
04:59:56.230 --> 04:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
numbers right 242 was the count 242 is
 
04:59:59.230 --> 04:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
the count and the
 
04:59:59.240 --> 05:00:02.510 align:start position:0%
the count and the
breakout

05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
148 and um 94 gotcha all right so this
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
is interesting that the majority is not
 
05:00:12.628 --> 05:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
through the
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
settlement office so why is that do you
 
05:00:19.548 --> 05:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
think well so all claims have to come
 
05:00:21.070 --> 05:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
through our
 
05:00:24.910 --> 05:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
office um and the statute um is which I
 
05:00:27.230 --> 05:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
think was designed well to make sure
 
05:00:30.190 --> 05:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
there was maximum Pathways to resolve a
 
05:00:30.200 --> 05:00:31.628 align:start position:0%
there was maximum Pathways to resolve a
claim

05:00:31.628 --> 05:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
claim
 
05:00:34.270 --> 05:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
quickly so the statute lays out two
 
05:00:36.750 --> 05:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
Pathways one with the direct
 
05:00:38.590 --> 05:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the Attorney General's
 
05:00:41.310 --> 05:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
office and the is through the resolution
 
05:00:43.708 --> 05:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
proceeding process which involves a
 
05:00:43.718 --> 05:00:46.628 align:start position:0%
proceeding process which involves a
hearing

05:00:46.628 --> 05:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
so why um claimants um uh pursue direct
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
settlement directly with the Attorney
 
05:00:56.030 --> 05:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
General's office and are successful in
 
05:00:57.868 --> 05:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
that road is not something I can speak
 
05:01:00.270 --> 05:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
to because the administrator is not
 
05:01:02.708 --> 05:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
involved um with those negotiated
 
05:01:05.788 --> 05:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
resolutions by Statute um we are
 
05:01:08.190 --> 05:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
involved in terms of our staff we
 
05:01:10.190 --> 05:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
receive the claim make sure it's
 
05:01:12.510 --> 05:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
complete make sure the claim gets in
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
front of the Attorney General's office
 
05:01:16.750 --> 05:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
so they have the claim in
 
05:01:20.270 --> 05:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
totality um and then should a stipulated
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
agreement come we have to make sure um
 
05:01:25.150 --> 05:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
that it's it's appropriate it's within
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
the bounds of an essential terms um so
 
05:01:29.150 --> 05:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
that we can approve it for payment
 
05:01:31.390 --> 05:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
processing okay all right so you said
 
05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
there's two other ways to remove money
 
05:01:35.070 --> 05:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
from the fund so one of them is your
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
expenses presumably correct so cost of
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
operations um which as I said is under
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
um a budget that's approved by the
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office we also
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
operate through a memorandum of
 
05:01:49.548 --> 05:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
understanding that the judicial branch
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
has um uh put together with the attorney
 
05:01:54.750 --> 05:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
general uh before our operations began
 
05:01:56.548 --> 05:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
uh which is how that budget and
 
05:01:59.470 --> 05:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement process occurs the fourth
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
category is the Attorney General's costs
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
under the settlement fund statute um the
 
05:02:08.910 --> 05:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General is permitted um to
 
05:02:11.948 --> 05:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
um to essentially invoice the fund
 
05:02:15.548 --> 05:02:15.558 align:start position:0%
directly for um costs that are I think
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
the language is something like not
 
05:02:19.910 --> 05:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
ordinary they're not ordinary operations
 
05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
something like that so they have um
 
05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
outside Council that they have retained
 
05:02:28.590 --> 05:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
um that assists them in um uh their part
 
05:02:30.990 --> 05:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
in participating with the claims process
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
um those dollar numbers on information
 
05:02:35.948 --> 05:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
and costs are in the quarterly report as
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
well okay okay and so far you've been
 
05:02:39.360 --> 05:02:40.470 align:start position:0%
well okay okay and so far you've been
allocating

05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
allocating
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
135 million is that uh the first first
 
05:02:47.470 --> 05:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
school year 2024 was the fund um
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
allocated 100 million um and that 100
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
million um was distributed um in Awards
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
in the first year uh when the statute
 
05:03:00.030 --> 05:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
was revised in 2024 last
 
05:03:03.310 --> 05:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
summer um the statute the legislature
 
05:03:08.670 --> 05:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
decided um to um identify by Statute $75
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
million per fiscal year um but did
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
actual Appropriations or designated
 
05:03:16.470 --> 05:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
funds of 60
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
million okay so um okay so and we
 
05:03:24.110 --> 05:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
understand that you have something like
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
32 remaining at the moment 32 could you
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
repeat that 32 million um
 
05:03:37.788 --> 05:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
so the roughly um we are at
 
05:03:41.948 --> 05:03:41.958 align:start position:0%
about um slightly over 30 million in
 
05:03:44.430 --> 05:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
committed funds um so it's somewhere I
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
think the the by um the administrator by
 
05:03:49.350 --> 05:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
the um the Attorney General's numbers
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
that he put in front of you today I
 
05:03:52.750 --> 05:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
think he said 27 million and we're our
 
05:03:54.270 --> 05:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
we balance our books together and
 
05:03:56.030 --> 05:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
coordinate and we would agree that that
 
05:03:58.590 --> 05:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
is roughly um the remainder of the of
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
the 60 million as we as we sit here
 
05:04:04.670 --> 05:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
today we we ran the numbers a a week or
 
05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
so ago so uh as you can imagine it
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
shifts but the the letter says you're
 
05:04:14.470 --> 05:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to run out of that by July 1st
 
05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere before it's it's right and so
 
05:04:18.548 --> 05:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
I can walk through those projections if
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.470 --> 05:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
okay so attachment a to the letter that
 
05:04:26.910 --> 05:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
we sent to the Attorney General's office
 
05:04:28.990 --> 05:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
to make an observation about the $60
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
million and the projection um as to
 
05:04:33.070 --> 05:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
whether it would be sufficient this
 
05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um we took the numbers in
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
the quarterly report of December 2024
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
and we looked at existing activity
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
through February 18th
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
2025 so about six weeks of activity
 
05:04:53.070 --> 05:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
about another 30 claims were
 
05:04:56.390 --> 05:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
resolved um which which generated about
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
roughly over $10 million in um resolved
 
05:05:00.120 --> 05:05:01.190 align:start position:0%
roughly over $10 million in um resolved
award

05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
award
 
05:05:05.590 --> 05:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
amounts so we took that that six week
 
05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
look and assuming which is a very big
 
05:05:11.030 --> 05:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
assumption um in this Dynamic
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
environment that that would be the uh
 
05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
spend moving forward for the remainder
 
05:05:17.948 --> 05:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
of the quarter and also the remainder of
 
05:05:17.958 --> 05:05:19.070 align:start position:0%
of the quarter and also the remainder of
fiscal

05:05:19.070 --> 05:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
05:05:22.868 --> 05:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
year adding in the actual and projected
 
05:05:24.708 --> 05:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
costs of both
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
offices brought the projection to
 
05:05:29.590 --> 05:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
slightly over 60
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
million table two we ran as you know
 
05:05:37.868 --> 05:05:37.878 align:start position:0%
projections are um uncertain uh but
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
informative when database based um and
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
in our environment the awards fluctuate
 
05:05:47.350 --> 05:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit uh depending on the
 
05:05:49.548 --> 05:05:49.558 align:start position:0%
nature of the abuse in a particular
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
claim the the frequency the severity all
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
go into if there is a verified claim
 
05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
what is the ultimate dollar amount
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's awarded according to the
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines that the legislature approved
 
05:06:04.510 --> 05:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
and it is um impossible for us to
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
predict which kinds of claims are coming
 
05:06:08.910 --> 05:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
to us in a given week we take the claims
 
05:06:10.350 --> 05:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
as they come
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
so table two um moved forward into
 
05:06:15.948 --> 05:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
another set of claims that
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
were close to final resolution right so
 
05:06:21.990 --> 05:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
we issue final decisions with an award
 
05:06:23.670 --> 05:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
amount that the claimants can either
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
accept or not accept once those
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
decisions are issued most of the time
 
05:06:31.708 --> 05:06:31.718 align:start position:0%
they're accepted when there are Awards
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
um and so those are essentially
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
encumbered funds and so we took a set of
 
05:06:37.868 --> 05:06:37.878 align:start position:0%
the next set of encumbered funds which
 
05:06:40.310 --> 05:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
is a set of about nine claims
 
05:06:43.230 --> 05:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
and that generated um an average you
 
05:06:45.310 --> 05:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
know instead of a 10 million it would
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
bring you to 12 almost 13 million as a
 
05:06:53.788 --> 05:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
um as a uh a benchmark to estimate the
 
05:06:56.390 --> 05:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
remainder of the fiscal year with so
 
05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
when you run that set of projections it
 
05:07:05.230 --> 05:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
brings you to 71 nearly 72 million um so
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
and this does not account for in other
 
05:07:09.070 --> 05:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
words this dollar amount does not
 
05:07:14.470 --> 05:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
account for for a a um of a a um a
 
05:07:15.948 --> 05:07:15.958 align:start position:0%
bundle of claims that are under
 
05:07:18.030 --> 05:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation right now and another words
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
we have a beginning to the life cycle of
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
a claim a middle and an end so sitting
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
here today we have um at least 25 claims
 
05:07:30.510 --> 05:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
um that are nearing the end and close to
 
05:07:33.910 --> 05:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
having an issue date and so uh you know
 
05:07:36.470 --> 05:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
that that it it keeps coming and we have
 
05:07:39.948 --> 05:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
hearings that are scheduled um weekly
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
um all the way throughout into July and
 
05:07:43.990 --> 05:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're and we keep scheduling them out as
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
a resolution pathway um so as those
 
05:07:50.030 --> 05:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
hearings come um at the end of Once the
 
05:07:52.470 --> 05:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
hearing day concludes um we have a
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
timetable that is set by the statute as
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
to how quickly um an a um decision a
 
05:08:00.190 --> 05:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
decision needs to come out we need to
 
05:08:02.830 --> 05:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
evaluate it is it eligible or not what's
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
the award if there is one what's the
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
payout for term of years um and so we
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
accounting for um how many hearings that
 
05:08:14.788 --> 05:08:14.798 align:start position:0%
are already scheduled these numbers do
 
05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
not account for how many more may be
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
coming we just took a an average um to
 
05:08:21.390 --> 05:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
give a picture as to whether we thought
 
05:08:24.270 --> 05:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
it was um uh we needed to make an
 
05:08:26.110 --> 05:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
observation about the 60 million do and
 
05:08:26.948 --> 05:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
whether we thought it would be
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
sufficient and we see plainly that the
 
05:08:31.510 --> 05:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
60 million will not be sufficient and so
 
05:08:33.788 --> 05:08:33.798 align:start position:0%
we're really here today to make that
 
05:08:36.750 --> 05:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
observation and to really request
 
05:08:39.470 --> 05:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not the $75 million that was
 
05:08:43.110 --> 05:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
identified as a fiscal year um um
 
05:08:45.948 --> 05:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
estimate or committed amount um will be
 
05:08:48.390 --> 05:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
coming or not uh because if it's not
 
05:08:50.190 --> 05:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
coming we need to make some adjustments
 
05:08:52.510 --> 05:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
pretty darn quick actually pardon my
 
05:08:55.708 --> 05:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
language um in terms of how we're going
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
to manage the claims the ones that are
 
05:09:00.990 --> 05:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled and keep moving through
 
05:09:03.070 --> 05:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
expeditiously and also how we're going
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
to keep operations in place so we have
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're both fully operational um and it
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
would be um unwise to dismantle those
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
operations so we would need to make sure
 
05:09:15.788 --> 05:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
there was a sufficient amount in the 60
 
05:09:17.590 --> 05:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
million if that is what our limit is
 
05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
going to be and we'll we'll live with
 
05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
whatever you give to us uh we'll need to
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
make sure there's a sufficient buffer to
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
keep our operations in place to get us
 
05:09:27.430 --> 05:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the next fiscal year Appropriations
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
assuming those are coming so when you um
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
settle a claim and let's assume it's for
 
05:09:38.350 --> 05:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
$100,000 can you settle do you settle it
 
05:09:40.030 --> 05:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
that the $100,000
 
05:09:43.030 --> 05:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
is paid right away or can it be paid
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
over you know $10,000 a year for 10
 
05:09:49.470 --> 05:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
years so the statute as amended last
 
05:09:51.628 --> 05:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
year uh for the first time gave the
 
05:09:54.150 --> 05:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
administrator the discretion to
 
05:09:56.430 --> 05:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
determine um according to factors by
 
05:09:58.750 --> 05:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
Statute whether it would be a lump sum
 
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
paid in the first year paid Allin one um
 
05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
or whether it would be paid in a term of
 
05:10:06.510 --> 05:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
years periodic installments up to 10
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
years um and so the statute lays that
 
05:10:12.190 --> 05:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
discretion to to the administrator um
 
05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
and uh lays out factors to consider
 
05:10:16.230 --> 05:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
about the claim in circumstances whether
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's Financial Health or otherwise um
 
05:10:22.590 --> 05:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
The Lion's Share of awards that are um
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
provided that are given um once they're
 
05:10:27.788 --> 05:10:27.798 align:start position:0%
verified um are periodic installments
 
05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
and the table actually identifies shows
 
05:10:31.390 --> 05:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
you a breakout of that if you'd like me
 
05:10:34.628 --> 05:10:34.638 align:start position:0%
to walk you through that right so so
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
then you can stretch out the money you
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
have through to the end of the year here
 
05:10:43.708 --> 05:10:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:43.718 --> 05:10:48.948 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.310 --> 05:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
okay it's my understanding that these
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
projections account for um the the the
 
05:10:57.868 --> 05:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
periodic installments uh that we're
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
currently doing and so therefore these
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
numbers would make the assumption that
 
05:11:05.230 --> 05:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
even with periodic installments um the
 
05:11:07.708 --> 05:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
$60 million would be insufficient I do
 
05:11:09.750 --> 05:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
not know sitting here today
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
how long and how quickly what the pace
 
05:11:14.510 --> 05:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the spend would be um but I'm
 
05:11:16.548 --> 05:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
certainly watching it with our we have a
 
05:11:19.110 --> 05:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
a financial um expert who's who's doing
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
that alongside us okay represent yeah
 
05:11:23.868 --> 05:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
we'll start with representative leechman
 
05:11:26.430 --> 05:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
then representative Griff thank you Mr
 
05:11:30.070 --> 05:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and I'm looking at page three
 
05:11:33.628 --> 05:11:33.638 align:start position:0%
um of the total resolve claims and I
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
noticed bullet number two it talks about
 
05:11:39.270 --> 05:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
settlement with the interest without
 
05:11:41.548 --> 05:11:41.558 align:start position:0%
interest so yes can you tell us what
 
05:11:44.670 --> 05:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
you're providing for interest is that on
 
05:11:46.590 --> 05:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
any claim that's being paid out over a
 
05:11:49.510 --> 05:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
period of years or I'm assuming that's
 
05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
what it is the dollar amount for the
 
05:11:53.190 --> 05:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
interest itself well what the rate may
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
be um the statute that the legislature
 
05:12:00.190 --> 05:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
adopted set a fixed rate of 5% 5% yep
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I guess I have another followup Mr
 
05:12:05.470 --> 05:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
chairman so the the former Chief Justice
 
05:12:08.670 --> 05:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
in his letter that we have says a
 
05:12:10.990 --> 05:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
shortfall like you said is likely to
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
occur um no money was set aside for
 
05:12:17.350 --> 05:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 right there's no request
 
05:12:19.470 --> 05:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere so once you're out of the 60
 
05:12:22.350 --> 05:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
million uh for 25 you'd have to probably
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
come in for a special request before
 
05:12:28.030 --> 05:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal but what about 26 and 27 because
 
05:12:30.750 --> 05:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen any requests or any idea
 
05:12:33.750 --> 05:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
what the settlement amount might be in
 
05:12:38.310 --> 05:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
26 and 27 for any claims to the extent
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
that there is no request for 2026 and
 
05:12:44.270 --> 05:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
2027 that is pending before the
 
05:12:47.230 --> 05:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
legislature um U that would be a
 
05:12:49.628 --> 05:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
surprise to us um and we would need to
 
05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
know it in order to determine what to do
 
05:12:53.470 --> 05:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
with the existing thousand claims that
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
we have pending and that are continuing
 
05:12:58.470 --> 05:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
to come and be filed um on a weekly
 
05:13:00.510 --> 05:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
basis that are expected to be filed all
 
05:13:02.750 --> 05:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
the way through June
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
30th Mr chairman as you probably saw in
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
the chief former Chief Justice letter
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
because the statute gives me expressed
 
05:13:12.510 --> 05:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
authority to approve payouts up to $75
 
05:13:16.110 --> 05:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
million in claims in any fiscal year so
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
I assume he could come back to
 
05:13:22.990 --> 05:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal U at the end of this fiscal year
 
05:13:25.510 --> 05:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
and look for additional funds but that's
 
05:13:27.990 --> 05:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
at least what he says in his
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
letter if you're expecting that request
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
for 2026 and 2027 to come directly from
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
the administrator I'll make sure to
 
05:13:38.350 --> 05:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
report that to him um I think it was our
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that the statute itself um
 
05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
specifically anticipate 75 million per
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
year um so if if we're misunderstanding
 
05:13:49.230 --> 05:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
on that that's good for us to know I
 
05:13:52.270 --> 05:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
believe it says up to yeah up to per
 
05:13:55.548 --> 05:13:55.558 align:start position:0%
year per year right okay representative
 
05:13:58.868 --> 05:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:14:02.510 --> 05:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh my question is
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
where there's a payment stretched over
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
time are you purchasing annuities to
 
05:14:11.548 --> 05:14:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
payment are we is is the administrator's
 
05:14:16.670 --> 05:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
office purchasing annuities to fulfill
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
the payment well TP typically on a suit
 
05:14:22.470 --> 05:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
where there's payments over time many
 
05:14:26.548 --> 05:14:26.558 align:start position:0%
times the an annuity with an insurance
 
05:14:29.990 --> 05:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
company is purchased and the insurance
 
05:14:30.000 --> 05:14:31.070 align:start position:0%
company is purchased and the insurance
company

05:14:31.070 --> 05:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
company
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
guarantees that that payment gets paid
 
05:14:37.910 --> 05:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
over time and it's usually a cheaper um
 
05:14:40.350 --> 05:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
you know there's usually a savings by
 
05:14:42.430 --> 05:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
purchasing an annuity because the
 
05:14:45.750 --> 05:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
insurance company is earning money on
 
05:14:48.910 --> 05:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
the money before they have to pay it
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
out and I wonder whether you were using
 
05:14:54.788 --> 05:14:54.798 align:start position:0%
that procedure or not it's a good
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
question um the Claims Administrator
 
05:15:01.708 --> 05:15:01.718 align:start position:0%
administrator bradrick oversees the
 
05:15:03.990 --> 05:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
claims process itself to see when a when
 
05:15:07.868 --> 05:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
a claim comes in um and verifies it uh
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
for eligibility and then determines
 
05:15:11.548 --> 05:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
whether there will be an award if it
 
05:15:13.150 --> 05:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
goes through the resolution preceding
 
05:15:15.390 --> 05:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
process at that point the administrator
 
05:15:17.910 --> 05:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
Project's responsibilities concluded he
 
05:15:20.470 --> 05:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
the claims in terms of being evaluated
 
05:15:21.788 --> 05:15:21.798 align:start position:0%
and verified as to whether it will get
 
05:15:24.510 --> 05:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
an award or not and what the payout is
 
05:15:26.670 --> 05:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
concludes and then it goes into payment
 
05:15:28.510 --> 05:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
processing and payment processing is
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
handled by the Attorney General's office
 
05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
um he has the charge of the fund Itself
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
by Statute um and there's also a portion
 
05:15:37.910 --> 05:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
under the statute that speaks to
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
structured settlements
 
05:15:40.628 --> 05:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
and the responsibility that
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
administrator bradrick um has been given
 
05:15:50.270 --> 05:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:53.590 --> 05:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh quality uh structured settlement
 
05:15:56.750 --> 05:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
folks and put them on the website so
 
05:15:58.628 --> 05:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
that they're available for for claimants
 
05:16:00.670 --> 05:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
to go and decide if they want to pursue
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
a structured settlement road which I
 
05:16:04.990 --> 05:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
imagine might be um addressing some of
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the U scenarios that you're that
 
05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
you're identifying but the the
 
05:16:10.230 --> 05:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
administrator does not have the
 
05:16:13.110 --> 05:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
authority to compel someone um to seek
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
annuities or to seek a structured
 
05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
settlement that is claimant's Choice
 
05:16:19.190 --> 05:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
under the statute as written
 
05:16:19.200 --> 05:16:20.990 align:start position:0%
under the statute as written
representative

05:16:20.990 --> 05:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:24.910 --> 05:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
wer thank you did administrative brri or
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
anybody from the Department appear
 
05:16:28.230 --> 05:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
before the governor or the or the
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
governor's uh budget director for the
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
preparation of the 2627 budget has the
 
05:16:36.868 --> 05:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
administrator appeared in front of the
 
05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
governor to discuss this
 
05:16:42.788 --> 05:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
budget it is it's my understanding um
 
05:16:44.590 --> 05:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
that the administrator has expressly
 
05:16:47.310 --> 05:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
made himself available and and that but
 
05:16:48.788 --> 05:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
it is not my understanding that such a
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
meeting has occurred yet but I would I
 
05:16:52.590 --> 05:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
would need to bring that back to the
 
05:16:55.230 --> 05:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
administrator to make sure that I have
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
up to the minute information on that so
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
from what he wrote to me he was never
 
05:17:03.628 --> 05:17:03.638 align:start position:0%
consulted about this part of the budget
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that he's not been
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
consulted thank you represent evil
 
05:17:11.670 --> 05:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
well I'm sure this is very difficult for
 
05:17:14.110 --> 05:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
you to answer but it follows along with
 
05:17:17.548 --> 05:17:17.558 align:start position:0%
the Chairman's um
 
05:17:20.230 --> 05:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions many have observed that
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
there's no settlement money included in
 
05:17:26.590 --> 05:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's draft of the budget
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
and would you have any idea why that
 
05:17:31.270 --> 05:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
would be the
 
05:17:33.990 --> 05:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
case I absolutely cannot speak on behalf
 
05:17:37.310 --> 05:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the governor I know but I
 
05:17:39.948 --> 05:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
just yeah well I just think it's worth
 
05:17:42.590 --> 05:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
raising that it's an interesting fact
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing in there for the
 
05:17:44.680 --> 05:17:46.070 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing in there for the
$150

05:17:46.070 --> 05:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
$150
 
05:17:48.868 --> 05:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
million so did I hear you say You have
 
05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
about a thousand um requests for
 
05:17:54.390 --> 05:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
settlements that that have not yet been
 
05:17:56.868 --> 05:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
processed is that right well currently
 
05:18:00.270 --> 05:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
we've have a a roughly over a thousand
 
05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
claims that have been filed to date from
 
05:18:04.910 --> 05:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning we have about 700 a little
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
bit over 700 claims that are actually
 
05:18:09.390 --> 05:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
open and pending so but we have more
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
coming and we have a uh we are there's
 
05:18:14.670 --> 05:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
about 25 law firms that are involved um
 
05:18:16.548 --> 05:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
with the claims process they they all
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't have an equal amount of claim
 
05:18:22.390 --> 05:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
claims obviously um and so we stay in
 
05:18:24.350 --> 05:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
touch with the claims Council to get a
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
general sensus to how many may be coming
 
05:18:28.070 --> 05:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
between now and and June 30th so that we
 
05:18:30.470 --> 05:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
can plan um in a pretty fluid
 
05:18:32.070 --> 05:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
environment we try to plan as best we
 
05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
can um and so we do understand um that
 
05:18:37.070 --> 05:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
there was a a commitment from at least
 
05:18:39.390 --> 05:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
one of the uh significantly larger law
 
05:18:42.590 --> 05:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
firms um during the last uh when the
 
05:18:44.230 --> 05:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
statute was being amended last year that
 
05:18:46.510 --> 05:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
they made a public commitment to bring
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
their uh this the claim the lawsuit
 
05:18:51.708 --> 05:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
based claims bring them out of court and
 
05:18:53.830 --> 05:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
bring them into their claims process um
 
05:18:55.390 --> 05:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
so far we've seen that commitment
 
05:18:59.230 --> 05:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
honored um and so really one of the
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
observations that is important for uh
 
05:19:03.230 --> 05:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
that the administrator wanted to make
 
05:19:07.548 --> 05:19:07.558 align:start position:0%
sure um I conveyed um today was if they
 
05:19:11.470 --> 05:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
really the cost of not if the U if the
 
05:19:16.030 --> 05:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
$75 million is not fully funded um what
 
05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
is likely to happen throughout the
 
05:19:21.788 --> 05:19:21.798 align:start position:0%
remainder of this fiscal year um it's uh
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's a destabilizing event um and
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
it it's a a loss of trust we've heard
 
05:19:30.270 --> 05:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
that quite a bit from claims Council
 
05:19:33.190 --> 05:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
that um if the money's not there then
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
that obviously means that we the
 
05:19:36.750 --> 05:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
administrator can't spend Beyond 60
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
million your choice um and we will have
 
05:19:42.788 --> 05:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
to take measures whether it's um
 
05:19:42.798 --> 05:19:43.788 align:start position:0%
to take measures whether it's um
canceling

05:19:43.788 --> 05:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
canceling
 
05:19:46.830 --> 05:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
hearings um whether it's um slowing down
 
05:19:49.548 --> 05:19:49.558 align:start position:0%
C the the the the the the tail end of
 
05:19:51.868 --> 05:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
the life cycle of a claim um in order to
 
05:19:53.708 --> 05:19:53.718 align:start position:0%
make sure we don't exceed the 60 million
 
05:19:55.868 --> 05:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
that's our responsibility uh and we'd
 
05:19:57.150 --> 05:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
need to do that in a way that we'd keep
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
operations open unless um we need to
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
account wasn't 100 million allocated in
 
05:20:08.670 --> 05:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 yes it so over the bium
 
05:20:12.390 --> 05:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
you've received 160 million right so
 
05:20:16.150 --> 05:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's more than you would expect by 75
 
05:20:19.948 --> 05:20:19.958 align:start position:0%
million a year in a banum the um we
 
05:20:22.670 --> 05:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
received the statute as it came to us um
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
so when we opened operations in January
 
05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
2023 the administrators
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
neutral um
 
05:20:32.030 --> 05:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
independent um was not involved with the
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
statutory process and built the claims
 
05:20:37.628 --> 05:20:37.638 align:start position:0%
process uh according to the statutory
 
05:20:40.150 --> 05:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
Authority and the legal documents that
 
05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature put in place for him to
 
05:20:45.270 --> 05:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
follow and abide by and so through the
 
05:20:48.030 --> 05:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
ordinary course of doing that um the100
 
05:20:51.670 --> 05:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
million that was set aside in that um
 
05:20:51.680 --> 05:20:53.310 align:start position:0%
million that was set aside in that um
initially

05:20:53.310 --> 05:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
initially
 
05:20:57.868 --> 05:20:57.878 align:start position:0%
um did get awarded to um uh the
 
05:21:00.910 --> 05:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
claimants and and we worked um side by
 
05:21:02.830 --> 05:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
side with the Attorney General's office
 
05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we did not go beyond
 
05:21:06.708 --> 05:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
that 100 million and then when the
 
05:21:08.830 --> 05:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
statute was being revised we were in the
 
05:21:09.990 --> 05:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
what next
 
05:21:14.948 --> 05:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
Waters okay um represent um is it a fair
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
statement that if um well in light of
 
05:21:19.948 --> 05:21:19.958 align:start position:0%
the fact at this point there's no money
 
05:21:22.590 --> 05:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
been put in the budget officially for
 
05:21:26.430 --> 05:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
the claims to continue in the next dium
 
05:21:31.230 --> 05:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
that the claimants could pursue their
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:37.030 --> 05:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
court because many of them have
 
05:21:40.990 --> 05:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
duplicate that that remains true so I
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
think when I think about the the cost of
 
05:21:46.070 --> 05:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
not and and destabilizing a successful
 
05:21:49.030 --> 05:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
system um one is that claims that are in
 
05:21:50.670 --> 05:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
court right now may not come to us at
 
05:21:53.830 --> 05:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
all um and the other is that the claims
 
05:21:56.270 --> 05:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
that are with us now can be withdrawn um
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
they they claimants have a choice to
 
05:22:01.470 --> 05:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
withdraw their claims um and I did want
 
05:22:04.510 --> 05:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
to just put maybe a a little bit of a a
 
05:22:07.390 --> 05:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
demographic point out there um out of
 
05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
the approximately th000 claims um that
 
05:22:12.110 --> 05:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
have been filed I think it's about
 
05:22:12.120 --> 05:22:13.470 align:start position:0%
have been filed I think it's about
roughly

05:22:13.470 --> 05:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
05:22:16.470 --> 05:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
55% that um came from Superior Court I
 
05:22:17.948 --> 05:22:17.958 align:start position:0%
could get some more a more accurate
 
05:22:20.910 --> 05:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
number so we do re U receive quite a few
 
05:22:23.670 --> 05:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
claims that have from law firms uh
 
05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
representing claimants that have not
 
05:22:31.110 --> 05:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
filed in court yet representative
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
W you mentioned 100 million went out in
 
05:22:36.510 --> 05:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
claims my recollection
 
05:22:40.868 --> 05:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
is a fairly uh major amount went out for
 
05:22:43.270 --> 05:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
costs administrative costs people get
 
05:22:47.548 --> 05:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
hired salaries and so on so you know it
 
05:22:49.110 --> 05:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't the first 100 million didn't all
 
05:22:52.830 --> 05:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
go out in claims the um yes you you are
 
05:22:54.910 --> 05:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
correct um the quarterly reports that
 
05:22:57.310 --> 05:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
are available on our website um has a
 
05:22:59.708 --> 05:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
succinct page at the end of the corly
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
report that identifies um um our costs
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
um to give you a sense of that when we
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
brought these projections um as part of
 
05:23:10.548 --> 05:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
the uh attachment a to the letter to the
 
05:23:14.510 --> 05:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general um we estimate about 4
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
million a um a fiscal year that is joint
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
cost of both our office and the um
 
05:23:26.590 --> 05:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.600 --> 05:23:28.548 align:start position:0%
 
office

05:23:28.548 --> 05:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
office
 
05:23:28.558 --> 05:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
office
okay

05:23:33.190 --> 05:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
um all right um so of the 20 42 cases
 
05:23:40.830 --> 05:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
that have been
 
05:23:44.788 --> 05:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
closed um how many received no payment
 
05:23:47.590 --> 05:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
no settlement no settlement um that's a
 
05:23:49.390 --> 05:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
good question I would need to go back
 
05:23:50.750 --> 05:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
and and look at those
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
numbers I mean that were basically found
 
05:23:55.390 --> 05:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:23:58.628 --> 05:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
um invalid I guess I would have would
 
05:24:02.670 --> 05:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
you like me to yes I'm curious and so
 
05:24:05.070 --> 05:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
we've been told in general that we
 
05:24:07.750 --> 05:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
expect I mean the the the deadline for
 
05:24:09.670 --> 05:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
filing claims is the end of the fiscal
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
year I think is that right yes right and
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
we expect that overall there will have
 
05:24:19.390 --> 05:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
been, 1500 claims does that still seem
 
05:24:21.788 --> 05:24:21.798 align:start position:0%
about accurate I would agree with the
 
05:24:24.990 --> 05:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General on that yeah okay good
 
05:24:27.270 --> 05:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
05:24:33.708 --> 05:24:33.718 align:start position:0%
much okay um can I just add one
 
05:24:33.718 --> 05:24:35.628 align:start position:0%
much okay um can I just add one
absolutely

05:24:35.628 --> 05:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:24:40.230 --> 05:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
um to the extent um the 75 million will
 
05:24:42.708 --> 05:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
not be fully funded for this fiscal year
 
05:24:44.590 --> 05:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
um I can't emphasize enough how
 
05:24:46.030 --> 05:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
important it would be for us to know
 
05:24:51.708 --> 05:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
that um to the the staff that we have um
 
05:24:53.470 --> 05:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
we would need to make sure that we can
 
05:24:56.670 --> 05:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
account for keeping um operations in
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
place from that 60 million and also
 
05:25:01.150 --> 05:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
figure out how to make adjustments for
 
05:25:04.830 --> 05:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
the awards all right so let me just say
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're in the wrong place to get another
 
05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
15 million in fiscal year
 
05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
2025 so the place to go is what's what
 
05:25:15.868 --> 05:25:15.878 align:start position:0%
we call the fiscal committee and I think
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General can probably help
 
05:25:20.910 --> 05:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
you with making a request to the fiscal
 
05:25:23.910 --> 05:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee for 15 million whether they
 
05:25:27.510 --> 05:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
Grant it or not I have no idea but thank
 
05:25:30.670 --> 05:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
you okay appreciate the time today all
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
right you're welcome all right so I
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
think we're done for today and we'll be
