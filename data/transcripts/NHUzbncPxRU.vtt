members task force members here as well
 
00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with the 306 the rationale
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
and reasoning behind what we're doing
 
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
today is that we have a number of bills
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh which we've retained we've retained
 
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
20 bills in education here of which we
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
had over 100 and we have well over a
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
hundred coming at us for the next
 
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
session and it's it's an exhausting
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
process but of those which we retained
 
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of subcommittee
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
meetings and hearings and full uh
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
Committee of the whole uh meetings to
 
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
address these retained bills several of
 
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
those retained bills have linkage to uh
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
topics and subject areas which are in
 
00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:34.830 align:start position:0%
topics and subject areas which are in
the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
306 and with that we're trying to find
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
out where we're going uh and how are we
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
going to react as a education committee
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for dealing with issues such
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
as mental health how are we going to
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
address that knowing that there might be
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
some changes or if there are changes
 
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
what do we have to do
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
statutorily so with that I don't want to
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%

students in public schools for what I've

day for public education in our great

state a day when school dropouts are a
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
thing of the past when the notion of
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
students getting a high school diploma
 
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
yet still having serious deficiency
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
genes in math and language arts is over
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
where students feel Joy in learning and
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
can't wait to get up in the morning to
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
learn where the word boring to describe
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
school is written about in history
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
books where we help put our students in
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
a position to earn their piece of the
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
American dream the day they leave our
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
system ready and prepared to contribute
 
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
to society their families their Futures
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
our state and our country that is the
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
promise of a competency based system
 
00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:04.069 align:start position:0%
promise of a competency based system
done

00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
well you may say I'm a
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
dreamer I'm not the only one there needs
 
00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
to be an extra effort on the part of all
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
stakehold holders in order to accomplish
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
this and I hope we start
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
today the traditional seat time model of
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
school did not work for me and my high
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
school I finished 206 6 out of 212
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
students I got rejected by every school
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
that I applied to school taught me that
 
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
I wasn't very bright life taught me that
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
school was wrong every day in America
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
7,000 students drop out of school this
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
is a national tragedy I've spent the
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
better part of my life trying to find a
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
since Republicans and
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
Democrats in 2005 we made New Hampshire
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
the first state in the United States to
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
put Competency Based learning into their
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
regulations today virtually every
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
state is now moving in the competency
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
Direction I have suggested that we put a
 
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
State Historical marker in front of lant
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
Hall to proudly show the physical
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
location of where the Nationwide
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
competency based movement
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
started this is my third time leading
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
this effort with the 306s my first time
 
00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:07.670 align:start position:0%
this effort with the 306s my first time
was

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
1992 when I was appointed by Jud Greg
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
when Judy the was chairman of the State
 
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
Board of Education and Charlie Marson
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
was commissioner the second time was
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
when I was named chairman of the board
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
from 2003 to 2005 by Craig
 
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
Benson when Nick donu was
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner it was Craig Benson who
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
charged me with finding a new way to do
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
public education a charge that most
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
people would have run screaming away
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
from I was reappointed to the state
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
board by Governor Lynch I am proud that
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
my work has not been viewed as
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
partisan once again I've been asked to
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
use my three decades of experience with
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
this document to help lead our state to
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
a true Competency Based model in leading
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
this charge I put together a public
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
education an Allstar team that I could
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
not be more proud of some of the members
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%

and I co-led this
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
effort we based our effort on advancing
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
Competency Based learning and the vision
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
of the State Board of Education written
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
in 2012 which states to harness
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
Community Resources and Technology to
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
provide a worldclass personalized
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
student- centered education in a
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
flexible Innovative learning environment
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
that promotes active engagement to
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
maximize the poal itial in every
 
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
individual the logic of a competency
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
based model is so simple and so obvious
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
that today as I said virtually every
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
state is moving in the competency
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
Direction here's how I have been
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
describing it for decades in the old
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
model the one that we are all familiar
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
with the constants are time and place
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
time 180 days time students Move On by
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
age Place Learning takes place inside
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
the walls of the school the variable is
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
learning some kids get A's B's C's D's
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
they still pass the course move on we
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
it make time and place the variable and
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
learning the constant we don't care the
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
state board made this statement in 2005
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
where learning happens we want to ensure
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
that it happens and at a high
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
level I tell students I've used this
 
00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
example many times and it it's become
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
actually somewhat uh famous other people
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
starting to say it that in the old model
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
you could get an A in addition
 
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.790 align:start position:0%
you could get an A in addition
subtraction

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
subtraction
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
multiplication and a dnf and Division
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
and you still pass the
 
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
course if we believe that division is
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
important why should we let you pass the
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
course if you're going to learn to fly
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
an airplane you get an A in taking off
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
you get an A keeping a plane in the year
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
but you get a deer and F in landing they
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't let you pass the course so a
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
competency based model says you
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
demonstrate proficiency Mastery in all
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
of the required competencies and then
 
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
level while New Hampshire may be the
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
first state to embrace Competency Based
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
learning I believe that some states may
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
have even passed
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
us it is my hope and I believe that of
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
the department that we reclaim our
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
rightful position as the leader in the
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
competency based movement it is my
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
belief that we will accomplish this only
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
if we are working together which is why
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
I love that you invited me to speak here
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
today Rick because we have to do this
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
together there has to be an effort that
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
has the department working with the
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
legislature on important stuff like this
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
much are we willing to work together
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
this is you know that is Rick's
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
indication by doing this to May that
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
that uh that there is a desire to make
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
that happen but I believe for some that
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
the answer is
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
no New Hampshire has been traveling down
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
this path for nearly 20 years more than
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
any other state a path supported by
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
every Governor a truly non partisan
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
effort while we've made progress our
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
progress is substantially behind the
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
vision that was created in uh in
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
2007 uh shortly after the uh the state
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
board approved the regulations in 2005
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is the document my document
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
it's Fallen apart because I've used it
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
so much but this is the document that
 
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
was created in 2007 and when you read
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
this document this 2007 document there
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
was intended to be the spirit and the
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
intent behind the 2005 regulations you
 
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.470 align:start position:0%
intent behind the 2005 regulations you
see

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:14.039 align:start position:0%
go personally my opinion is that over
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
the past 20 years our department of
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
education has done not done enough to
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
support our schools in their efforts to
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
transform to a different model since
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
embarking on this Competency Based
 
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
Journey we still have largely a 20th
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
century system with increasing
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
sprinklings of a competency based model
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
on top how much longer do we need to
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
wait another 20
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
years we have kids falling through the
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
basis are we going to deprive
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
especially traditionally underserved
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
students with the promise of a
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
competency B Bas learning
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
system because the leadership in the
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
state dragged its
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
feet we can do this but we have to do it
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
together I'm convinced that House and
 
00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
Senate education committees have the
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
potential to be a key Catalyst in
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
leading us to a great
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
place in a nonpartisan
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
way I'm asking the next question because
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
I truly don't know what the answer is
 
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
has uh Our House and Senate education
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
committees actually committed to moving
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
us to a true Competency Based system I I
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
don't know what the answer to that is
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
Rick whether you guys have done that
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
formally or
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
not I'm guessing that the answer is yes
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
be because based on Senate Bill uh
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
276 uh relative to Career Readiness and
 
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.789 align:start position:0%
276 uh relative to Career Readiness and
career

00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
career
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
credentials it sure seems like that's
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
the direction that that you guys are
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
moving in and it fits perfectly with
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
what we have been trying to
 
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
accomplish but to date I will tell you
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
that uh that our team has not
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
recommended putting into the um
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
regulations a graduation credit link to
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 276 maybe that's something
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
that uh House and Senate education
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
committees would like to make a
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation on and my guess is that
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education would
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
welcome uh something like that so I'm
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'm in hoping that there will be some uh
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
Fingerprints of of House and Senate um
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
on the ultimate uh uh plan that that uh
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
that gets uh passed into into uh uh
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
state regulations when the State Board
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
opens up uh rule making passes through
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
the 180 days and uh and um and moves on
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
in this in this H piece of legislation
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
ra regulations uh to make it make it
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
real so I would I would love to see that
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education is by
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
Statute the board of directors for the
 
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
public schools in 2005 the board did its
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
job by establishing the direction it
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
believes our state needs to move in and
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
the whole country is following New
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's lead but what about here at
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
home is it possible that the slowness of
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
the pace of change is in no small part
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
because we have not brought together our
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
state leadership in this great
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
task As Americans we need to do this as
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
part of our patriotic Duty I am
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
convinced that America will not be the
 
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
economic winner of the 21st century if
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
we cannot get our public education act
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
together and watching the dis the
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
disarray in watching Washington is
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
discouraging China has more advanced
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
placement students than we have
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
students we can't afford to let kids
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
fall through the cracks we need to get
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
the best out of every student we will
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
get that if we have a United effort to
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
create a true Competency Based model a
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
model where every student believes that
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
they are learning for their own personal
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
benefit not for the benefit of the
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
teacher or the
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
school since first taking on this task a
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
couple of things have been made clear to
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
me first our public schools and our
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
educators are
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
stressed I've spoken in more than half
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
the States since we start started going
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
down this Competency Based path
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
preaching the Competency Based gospel
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
bragging about New Hampshire I've given
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
about 1500 presentations mostly in New
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public education is feeling
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
pressure from many directions well I
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
believe that public education in our
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
state is in better shape than in many
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
there is considerable fear and distrust
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
as a result of this trust this distrust
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
statements and accusations have been
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
made stoking that fear it has led to to
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
angry and inaccurate statements that are
 
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
not helpful one Organization leader said
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
that in this process feedback was
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
permitted by invitation
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
only that the rules have been worked on
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
mostly in secret and that quote
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
generally rules are developed through a
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
series of public meetings with public
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
input from all stakeholders that would
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
include teachers parents Educators Etc
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
end quote one would expect
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
that a statement like this from a leader
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
of a Statewide education group would be
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
individual I know that the statements
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
are highly inaccurate because I am the
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
most experienced person in the state
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
with regards to how these rules have
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
been reviewed in the last 30 years and
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
as promised this has been the most
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
inclusive process in the history of this
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
document the State Board of Education
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
is obliged to have one public hearing on
 
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.149 align:start position:0%
is obliged to have one public hearing on
the

00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
306s in 2005 his state board chair I
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
decided it would be better to hold
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
meetings on the 306s around the
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
state we held five face-to-face meetings
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
one in each
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
region then executive director of the
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school boards Association
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
the late Ted comto referred to our
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
effort as the most inclusive in the
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
history of Education in New Hampshire a
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
couple of years later Mark Joyce then
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
school administrators Association in
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
testifying to the state board on a
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
hearing on special education said why
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
don't you run this process like you did
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
the minimum
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
standards despite that 2005 beyond the
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
Call of Duty effort I pledged we would
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
make this by far the most inclusive
 
00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.750 align:start position:0%
make this by far the most inclusive
process

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
ever in April of 2022 a year into our
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
work the 306 te presented at a session
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
of the school administrators Innovations
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
conference a conference open to all
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
Educators we've had 20 plus meetings
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
Zoom we held a two-day event with ASC
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
that included 40 to 50 content experts
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
mostly teachers we did something similar
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
to this in
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
2004 we told the school administrators
 
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
Association that we would have
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
information listening sessions in any
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
school district in the state that would
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
invite us I think that some doubted that
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
we would physically be able to do that
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that I had a serious
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
health issue in
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
2021 and after 2 years of coid team team
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
306 teammates Nate Harris Val ANUK and I
 
00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
held sessions around the state in every
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
school district that invited us nearly
 
00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:11.799 align:start position:0%
tripling the number of the 2005
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
sessions from all of these meetings with
 
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
various stakeholder groups one of our
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
most productive efforts has been working
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
with the school administrators
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
associations the school leaders who are
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
charged with implementation of the 306s
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
at the district level
 
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.350 align:start position:0%
at the district level
the

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
nhsaa gave us a detailed list pages of
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
their concerns with our first
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
draft we have spent a lot of time with
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
their leadership and I believe that we
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
have satisfied their
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
concerns let me repeat that I believe
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
concerns I want to personally thank n

Competency Based
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
learning if we have truly satisfied the
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
needs of the school administrators
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
Association some might

to go to the State Board of
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
Education but we're not there yet

a working s uh session with longtime New

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
educator former do doe person who knows
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
this document as well as I anybody in
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
the state Christine Downing she is here
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
today and she has been Gathering input
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
from 100 to 200 teachers from around the
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
state and with ir Richardson from the
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
Nea leadership team who is a teacher of
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
teachers and who was asked to be on the
 
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
original 306 but
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
declined we're sitting down with them to
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
help us
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
synthesize the feedback from Christine
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
sessions and from our 40ish sessions
 
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
with various groups for possible
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the State Board SO
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
meetings in
 
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.149 align:start position:0%
meetings in
205

00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
205
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
five this time around 40
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
so when anybody says that this has not
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
been an inclusive process you can
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
constantly say to them and with numbers
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
to back it up that this has been the
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
most inclusive effort of the minimum
 
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
standards in the Department of Education
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
history by far and if anybody wants to
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
challenge me on that bring it
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
on but secondly and most importantly in
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
all of our face-to-face listening
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
sessions it's clear to Nate Harris Val
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
and myself
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire Educators believe in
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
Competency Based
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
learning they want it done well they
 
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
want the department to do its job in
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
assisting the system and getting to that
 
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
new model and we couldn't agree with
 
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.750 align:start position:0%
new model and we couldn't agree with
them

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
more I can't promise you what the state
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
board will do with our
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations I believe that they will
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
say yes to
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
many so where do we go from here we
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a historic
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity in front of us if we do this
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
together it's an opportunity to create a
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
system of Education where we put joy in
 
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:35.559 align:start position:0%
the process of learning for every
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
student where we give students the
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to play an important role in
 
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
the direction of their learning where we
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
raise the bar by redefining the high
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
school credit to mean achieving
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
proficiency with a bundling of related
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
competencies not just passing the course
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
with the c or a d and moving on
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether you're not you
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
actually learned
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
and by embedding minimum graduation
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
competencies required to earn a
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
diploma we want the notion of school to
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
be about the process of learning with
 
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
the entire Community playing a role in
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
the creating in
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
creating multiple learning
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities a new and better school
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
choice system inside the public
 
00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:28.039 align:start position:0%
schools since we started going this down
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
this path in
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
2005 I've actually been
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
told by two private school leaders that
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
they are afraid of what we're
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
doing it's never been about whether our
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
teachers are doing a good job or not
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
they were asked to do their job in a bad
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
system A system that was not based on
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
learning but was based on seat time
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
where students moved on to the next
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
level regardless of whether or not they
 
00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.110 align:start position:0%
level regardless of whether or not they
actually

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
learned 20 years
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
now we've been at this no one's
 
00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:10.039 align:start position:0%
expecting a flip of the switch but what
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
some of us are expecting is a concerted
 
00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan all Hands-On deck effort to
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
make Competency Based learning a
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%

get into the this discussion and getting
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
into the some of these changes that we
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
see here on the side by side we have
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
with what we have now and what is being
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
proposed well over 100 Pages here um I
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
I'd like to you know just ask several
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
several questions which uh are floating
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
around one I developed as you were
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
discussing here uh we've had a number of
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
presentations through the state 40 plus

you said y um another other other
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
sources of gathering information where
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
what's the process got for us in the
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
future you mentioned that you're getting
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%

that's it thank you so much so Fred
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
going forward with that what is the
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
process that we're looking at there's a
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
lot of rumor and gossip going around
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
that these these uh proposed rules for
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards of public school
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
approval were going to go before the
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
board for approval um yesterday and I
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
heard that and I said no I and my call
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the department was no they're not
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
they're not on the docket for for quite
 
00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
a while yeah uh so so the concern is
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
what are your steps next does does the
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
feedback and the information garnered at
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
all these hearings get compiled and does
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
it go back to your task force and they
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation or is it going
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
from their being compiled and and and
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
modifying based upon those and without
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
going back to the task force going
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
directly to the State Board saying
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%

out so what we're doing tomorrow um we
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
have um input from from those all those
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
sessions we've had we've got uh um uh
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
you know some some from some groups the
 
00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:33.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know the Nea for example sent us
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
a um a formal uh document like the uh
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
like the school administrators did uh
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's some others that have done the
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
same thing sending us you know written
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
um uh written uh suggestions um so um in
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
in Nate's work and he can speak to it
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
better than than I can in Nate's work
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
with the school administrators as you
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
can imagine the school administrators
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
had many of the same concerns that were
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
expressed by other other groups and uh
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
so when we go through the um the
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
different recommendations from groups
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
many of those suggestions have already
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
been dealt with um in uh in uh Nate's
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
work with uh uh with the school
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
administrators uh and you know our our
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
two I mean we we all work with them um
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
but Nate you know Nate put the finishing
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
touches on it um so that is U that's
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and um so we hope to get you
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
know we've got a couple hour session we
 
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
hope to get through a good bunch of that
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully most of it tomorrow um and we
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
need to get to uh Nate that information
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
by next uh Thursday I think it is Nate
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so I can talk a little bit about
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
the just sort of the process um um so I
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
know that the the State Board of
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
Education wants to be able to take a
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
look at the standards and start to have
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
their discussions around it um in order
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
to do that it has to be introduced as an
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
item with the state board so that they
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
can begin discussing it um our plan is
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
to take all of the feedback that we have
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
received both the feedback that has
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
already been incorporated into the draft
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
as well as any and all public feedback
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's been received by Fred his team or
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
has been sent to the department um all
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
that will be put together and provided
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
to the State Board of Education along
 
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
with the draft that is at the current
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
point when we've compiled all that
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
feedback together um as you can imagine
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
every time we receive a piece of
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
feedback and we take a look at the draft
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's constantly changing so we want to
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know we're not
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
providing just a a draft but also all
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
the feedback that has got along with
 
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.230 align:start position:0%
the feedback that has got along with
that

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
draft and and I would I would add to
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
that all the feedback that that the 306
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
team has said yes to I mean we uh at one
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
session we had uh I remember we had
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
someone say well can't we go back to the
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
old sage on the stage model and that's
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
not going to make it into the draft so
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
um so the you know the team uh uh will
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh assess um the the uh feedback from
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
various organizations and make a
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
decision which uh which are the ones
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
that we want to actually pass forward
 
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
for consideration to the State Board it
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
so what I'm gleaning from all this is
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
that the draft will be submitted to the
 
00:37:33.319 --> 00:37:34.150 align:start position:0%
that the draft will be submitted to the
State

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
Board there's a feedback package here
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's not part of the
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
draft that's going to go to the state
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
board at this point in time yes so then
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
the task force itself is done their
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
job in essence I I believe that that you
 
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
know to be the case I mean to me it's
 
00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:58.839 align:start position:0%
the task force has done its job the uh
 
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
um my guess is that the commissioner and
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
the department will in the State Board
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
will probably ask me
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
to stick around through the process for
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
assistance whenever whenever I can help
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
and and just so that everybody you know
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
gets a a decent timeline on this so
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking at getting something to
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
them for their November state board
 
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.710 align:start position:0%
them for their November state board
meeting

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
and um and and if we are successful
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
doing that which I I hope we will be um
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
then uh then it's it's uh whether the
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
State Board takes any action on that or
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure do you know whether the
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
state board will take action on that or
 
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.790 align:start position:0%
state board will take action on that or
not

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
Nate so just like any set of Ru making
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
um if the State Board takes any action
 
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:53.079 align:start position:0%
it kicks off a specific timeline that
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
the state board has to follow um so I
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
know that they want to begin publicly
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
discussing the rules um but you know
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
it's not something where a draft can be
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
presented and the State Board votes and
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
approves the draft there's a full rul
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
making process that would end up being
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
kicked off by that um and I I would
 
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
probably Echo what Fred said my guess is
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
the stateboard is going to want to have
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
conversations like this one as well with
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
members of the task force and with Fred
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
as part of that um but there will also
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
be public hearings at the State Board
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
holds as well then then Fred and Nate
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
are there any changes within this
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
package that I haven't
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
omy that are contrary or different from
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
statutory law that exists right now
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
other words you're going to have to take
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
the package after from the state board
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
to jail car yes they're going to say is
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
there statutory language which supports
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
what you're propos what you're proposing
 
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:46.870 align:start position:0%
what you're propos what you're proposing
to

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
us is for example definitions have they
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
changed and have they changed how are
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
you going to uh explain that to Jael car
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
when the statute says something
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
contrary that's so that's something
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
that sorry I didn't realiz button didn't
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
get hit there um yeah so that that's
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
part of the rle making process um we
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
tend to have a number of discussions
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
with Jael car um particularly something
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
of this magnitude um when you're talking
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
about a large number of changes my guess
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
is there will be you know a decent
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
amount of back and forth with Jael car
 
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
specific to definitions one of the
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why there's a little bit of uh
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
timeline on this now is um any any rules
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
have expiration dates on them um
 
00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
different parts of the 306s over the
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
last 20 years have been changed and
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
edited and adopted at different times
 
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
and parts of those rules are coming to
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
their expiration dates some of them have
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
recently expired the definition section
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
being one of those so right now that
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
definition sections in the 306s has
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
actually expired and isn't in that um
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
isn't in the current draft so we need to
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
move forward with some of these sections
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
because we're hitting up against some
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
deadlines right now with rule expiration
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
dates yes and we've been through that
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
before yes
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
yes so thank you for being here this
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
morning so the clarification uh Dr
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
Green the the State Board receives the
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
report at some point in time perhaps in
 
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:20.839 align:start position:0%
November does a board then work on the
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
redrafting or looking at uh the multiple
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
input sessions that have come out that's
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
not that does not start the 180 day
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
timeline the as I understand it it's
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
when the board accepts the report that
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
the actual 180 day timeline if that be
 
00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
the case then are you saying that the
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some time frame
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
within which the State Board is going to
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
work on the document first before the
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
180 days timeline start is that
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
correct that would certainly be within
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
their purview yes um I haven't had any
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
specific conversation with the the state
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
board or the board chair as to whether
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
they have a a timeline for when they
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
want to work on the rules I know they
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
want each of the state board members
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at the draft um but
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know what timeline they're
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
looking at for their work sessions
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
versus when they look at starting it as
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
that official rulem process so we're
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
we're still unclear then exactly when
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
the 180 days would actually start then
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct okay thank you
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
as as I understand it and you correct me
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong the state board will uh
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
will actually officially vote to enter
 
00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:35.950 align:start position:0%
will actually officially vote to enter
Ru

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
Ru
 
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
making is that isn't that the way that
 
00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.670 align:start position:0%
making is that isn't that the way that
it

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.710 align:start position:0%
it
works

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
so that if they did that that would
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
start the clock right yes right okay I'm
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
gonna I whether that happens you whether
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
that happens in
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
November I don't and then I'm going to
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Senator Waters with us
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
too or other members of the committee
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
I'd recognize of course Senator first
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
but one of the reasons why we um asked
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
that you present here today is that we
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
are dealing with three bills this
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon dealing with mental health and
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
when I look at the Ed rules
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
30640 it identifies health health
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
education and within that there
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
subcategories underneath that one of
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
which is mental health in the proposed
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
rules I'm seeing all those elements
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
within underneath these categories such
 
00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:33.559 align:start position:0%
as Career Technical
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
education uh mathematics social studies
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
Etc being
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated so then then we're concerned
 
00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:44.839 align:start position:0%
that what is part of Health how do we
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
write AC how are academic standards
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
going to be developed how are the old
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks going to be
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
written to incorporate those academic
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
standards now this is different than the
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
minim Public School standards for
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
approval which the state board has a
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility for but we have concerns
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
36.4 then what kind of statutory
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
reference do we have to support uh the
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
teaching of that in the schools so that
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
was from an earlier draft um I want to
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
say several months ago all the program
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
standards that are in the back now
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
starting from I think right around 3063
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
going through to the end um I think the
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
last one was Holocaust and genocide
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
studies all those program um areas are
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
um still in the current draft of the
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
rules and they haven't been
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
changed that's refreshing to hear so all
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
those subject areas would the elements
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
within remain intact yes the only thing
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
that has been changed is there are four
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
or five of the subject areas that called
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
out specific areas of assessment and we
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
have a section within the 306 rules that
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
also calls out assessment there were
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
some redundancies in those sections so
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
what we did was we expanded the section
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
in the 306s on assessment and then in
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
each of the subject areas we refer to
 
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
that particular assessment subject that
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
says when you are assessing students you
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
need to follow all of the regulations
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
that exist within uh and I believe it's
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
3062 now um these assessment areas so
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
essentially that way you're not looking
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
at you know the business education rules
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
with one set of assessment requirements
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
in English with a different set of
 
00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
assessment requirements math with a
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
different set of assessment requirements
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
we tried to take all of that and make
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
one expansive assessment
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
section thank you I I want to also say
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
that we tried to communicate with
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
virtually everybody um that if you have
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
I mean because our you know our team is
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
not a a team of specialists in an area
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
like mental health that you're talking
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
about Rick uh and so many of the other
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
areas and we tried to to talk to uh any
 
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
group that would that would have
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
interest in talking to us about uh do
 
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
they have specific things that they
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
would like uh to uh us to address in the
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and we were and we did
 
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
connect with a number of them and we
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
have uh information recommendations from
 
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
a number of specific uh organizations um
 
00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
that that uh that's on our shopping list
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow to go over and uh and and see
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
about what we uh recommend to the State
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
Board in these subject areas were real
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
concerned when you send teams out from
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
the Department to assess whether the
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
schools are meeting the minimum
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
with these elements within those subject
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
areas currently there it's an area which
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
can be asked what are you doing about
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
this Mr School in in ensuring that
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
you're addressing this topic without
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
them there then there it's raised
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
considerable concern amongst this
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
committee right
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
here yeah so within the next two weeks
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
my office is releasing the uh new ibas
 
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
survey this is the input based
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
accountability uh survey that's in
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
statute and that refers directly to
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
those sections of the Ed 300s or the
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
e306 so for example when principles go
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
in to complete the ibass survey it's
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to say you know do you have a
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
mathematics program that is consistent
 
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:28.790 align:start position:0%
mathematics program that is consistent
with

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
ed360 and they'll go in and they're
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
going to see those program standards
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
they referring to and so when we talk
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
about you know um whether schools are
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
beating an adequate education for those
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
program standards that's what the ibass
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
is attached to it's attached directly to
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
those program standards at the end of
 
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.510 align:start position:0%
those program standards at the end of
the

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
anything just a couple of
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
comments I just took a look at the
 
00:47:58.829 --> 00:47:58.839 align:start position:0%
reading and math scor and science course
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
this morning and they are dismal and I
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
just think that for a state New
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have to do much
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
better there's also an article about the
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
children trying to enter college and
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
colleges have to be prepared to have a
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
year of remedial instruction in order
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
for these kids to be able to progress
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
and eventually get their college
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
degree this past weekend I ATT attended
 
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:28.839 align:start position:0%
a conference on education and Workforce
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
Development and one of the speakers said
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
that we had a very good educational
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
program last century and he said for us
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
to try to keep those same standards now
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
100 years later is totally wrong we have
 
00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
to do something we have to get our kids
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
prepared for the time that we live in
 
00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.430 align:start position:0%
prepared for the time that we live in
right

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
now I totally agree um here's what I
 
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
would say
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
once again and it's somewhat repeating
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
what I said earlier but in this this old
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
model that was created in essence in
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
1906 at a conference in Harvard um that
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh started this system based on what we
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
call the Carnegie unit that was based on
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
time it was not based on learning and uh
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
it was in in many ways a sorting
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
mechanism to figure out which kids they
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
thought were smart enough to go to
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
college and other kids will just send
 
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
them into the workplace or into the
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
military and it really did not assure uh
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
learning in in a competency based model
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
if we're doing a real Competency Based
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
model then you don't move on until you
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that you have actually
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
learned and um and and and that learning
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you're doing it if if our schools are
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
doing it right is not is not about you
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
can pass the test on Friday and then you
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
forget it two weeks later it's about
 
00:49:58.799 --> 00:50:00.309 align:start position:0%
forget it two weeks later it's about
truly

00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
truly
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
mastering um the uh becoming proficient
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
in whatever the required competencies
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
are and that means that you can use that
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
information in known and unknown
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
situations in the future and we're
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
clearly demonstrating for our colleges
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
that they they are accepting these uh uh
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
students that they see on their uh
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
report cards or their transcripts that
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
they've gotten certain skills and when
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
they get to College they find out it's
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
not quite it's not quite the case and uh
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
that uh that they actually haven't um
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
they haven't learned what they needed to
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
learn so so in I think in a true
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
Competency Based
 
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
model that if we do this job right uh I
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
believe that this is this is going to be
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
a new day for
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
Education okay I I'd like to open this
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
up to the committee right there there's
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
issues which we want to discuss District
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
competencies graduation competencies
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
proficiency Mastery all these terms
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
which are within repan
 
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Bon uh Dr Green uh and
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
others from uh from the the 306 team
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
that uh that are joining us this morning
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the work that you've done
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
um my um not not not withstanding the uh
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
the Senator's comment with respect to
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
student performance you you know I've
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
always felt proud particularly uh 12
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
years you know on a on a local school
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
board and now serving on the education
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
committee that New Hampshire students
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
overall perform among the best in the
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
country I'm talking about New
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public school students
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
performing among the best in the country
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
normally top five or six you know in the
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know of all the of all the uh 50
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
states and um uh but uh but it's also uh
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
really uh really glaring to me uh um and
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
to I think many uh many people across
 
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
the state um and uh and especially came
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh came out during the work we did on
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
with the school funding commission that
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
that Val ANUK and and Mel and Rick also
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
and Karine uh served on um that uh that
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know this this strong student
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
performance doesn't exist everywhere and
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh where I live in Hopkinson where I
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
served on the board for 12 years our
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
average student performance I think is
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
in the 80th percentile Statewide which
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
is obviously above State average but you
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
only have to go 15 20 minutes up the
 
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
road up to Newport and the average
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
student performance there is in the
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
fourth percentile which um which in a
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
lot of I mean that I don't think is
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
anything that any school district would
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
want to brag about but um but when you
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at at um you know um despite
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
just being 152 minutes uh you know up
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
the road uh you take a look at those two
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
communities and they're both very
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
different in terms of the socioeconomic
 
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
um uh capacities of those communities so
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson supports a strong school
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
school budget a strong uh uh per student
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
uh cost and um and we've got we've got
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
pretty high property taxes to do it you
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
go up to
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
Newport not so strong a school budget
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
not so strong per student cost but super
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
high property taxes they're working
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
Beyond harder than we're working in
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson uh and what are they getting
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
for it they're getting an average fourth
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
percentile um you know student outcome
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
and um and so so you know so I think
 
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
when we take a look at student
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
performance across the state there's a
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
lot of factors that that go into it and
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
uh and certainly the uh the minimum
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
standards would be one of those factors
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
among a lot of different factors that
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
play into uh to how well um students
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
learn but the question that I have for
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
for uh for you is really more um more
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
process oriented along the lines of what
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
Rick was um what you know started
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
started in on I think uh um I think Rick
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
would probably get to this question too
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
but um but under the the
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
section uh of law that uh that defines
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
the substit of educational content of an
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
adequate education which the 306s lean
 
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
on to um um you know as part of the
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
in um in uh Roman 4 of that where it
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
talks about the minimum standards for
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
public school approval one of the um one
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
of the the provisions in statute states
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
that that the State Board shall not
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
amend any existing academic standards
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
and shall not approve any new academic
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
standards without the prior review and
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the legislative
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
oversight committee established in 193
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh C colon 8A which uh representative
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
llad is the the chair of and um and I
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
serve on on that so so my question is um
 
00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
is prior to the state
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
board's approval of any proposed rule
 
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
changes and beginning this 180-day clock
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh what is the board's plan for bringing
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
these before the legislative oversight
 
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
committee so I I can say that I've uh
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
spoken several times with uh Department
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
attorneys regarding that particular
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
provision and what the process will be
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
for noticing the oversight committee
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
when the board gets to that point um I
 
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.039 align:start position:0%
think there needs to be some kind of
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
formal process for when the board starts
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
theirs and then sends a notice directly
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
to the oversight committee um exactly
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
how that works or what the notice will
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
look like um I'm not sure about but it
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
is something that you know has has been
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
discussed um and I've brought it up with
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
our Attorneys at the department to make
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
sure that that process moves forward so
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
ju just a follow up and thank you very
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
much Dr Green for that um
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
so would that take place prior to the
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
approval um of the rules and the 180 day
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
clock you know jail car clock or would
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
it would it take place prior to uh to
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
that maybe after the board has seen the
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
rules and then prior to acting on them
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
so where it starts I'm not entirely sure
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
but I think it would have to occur it
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
would have to occur before any kind of
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
approval move forward or before anything
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
would be able to be sent to Jael car and
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
work done with OS because I think there
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be some simultaneous processes
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
going on there where you need both the
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
approval of that oversight Committee of
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
any revisions to the standards as well
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
as the approval from the state board um
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
I haven't been involved in in what that
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
process looks like in working with both
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
the state board and the oversight
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
committee um which is part of why I sort
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
of punted that over to the attorneys to
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
say you know there's a legal process
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
here that needs to be figured out
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
because it's in statute right y no I
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and so I I would
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate if if uh this committee could
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
could maybe receive some some
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
um you know U information on on not not
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the on the day it would
 
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
happen but in terms of the timeline the
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
process yeah timeline prior to the 180
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
day plot starting that that the
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
oversight committee would be presented
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh and given the opportunity that it is
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
entitled to uh statute to review and
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
recommend um
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
U any changes to
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
rules thank you very much just interject
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
on that one uh the as I spoke with
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative Miler and Luna this
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
morning the next step for this committee
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
would to throw the ball to the
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee and we
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
will be in contact with you regarding
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
that further represent Myer thank you Mr
 
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
chair I've got uh a question and a
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
statement uh Dr Green when did you say
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
that the new draft is going to be
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
available uh so we're looking at the
 
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
November no thank you uh we're looking
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
at the November state board meeting um
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
it's always the second Thursday of the
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
month I believe that's November 9th so
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
that's when the new draft will be
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
available for those of us to look at it
 
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
then yes yep and all of the public
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
feedback as well because that would all
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
be uh anything that we submit to the
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education becomes a
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
public document so that's available as
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
part of their agenda and materials yeah
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
my statement is kind of tough that I'm
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
about to make I've been on this
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
committee for 12 years and in the prior
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
administrations there has been a
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
concerted effort to work with school the
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
school Community to create uh the new
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
draft Etc when these every 10 years when
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
these come up you need to know that
 
00:58:51.309 --> 00:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
there are some of us that do not have a
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
trust in the Department of
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
Education uh it has not uh frankly the
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
leadership has not reached out in the
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
past to school leaders to teachers it's
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
been pretty much single
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
Dimension I know Fred has tried to
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
engage more and more people so the
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
concern that I have frankly is that uh
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
when the public statements get put into
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
this document what the state board will
 
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
do because frankly the state board has
 
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
not listened to the volume of voices
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
that have been there in its presence and
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
some of the decisions frankly most of
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
the decisions they've made have been
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
contrary to those who work in public
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
schools on a day-to-day basis
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative Miler I want to be very
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
careful here because this is an issue
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the the group the
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
task force and what they're submitting
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
to the State Board of Education not to
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
the department I understand that and my
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
my my point is that I want to make sure
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
the department and understands that
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
there are people out here that are
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
watching this very
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
carefully and the response that the
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
department has to this recommendation
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
that's coming from this committee is
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to be sorely looked at and
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully that the history that the
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
department has will not continue and
 
01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
will take the input from the community
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
and from the various groups seriously in
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
a way they haven't in the
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
past once again we this has gone on the
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
road for 40 type presentations plus
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
working groups um I recognize that in
 
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
being at one of those hearings at
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
conquered High School I saw folks saying
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
we have a concern here here or there uh
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
I am just hoping that those
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations will go forward as
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned they would uh and it'
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
be good if it went back to the task
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
force too and so the final draft that
 
01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
goes to the State Board would be from
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
the task force not from some on the task
 
01:00:58.990 --> 01:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
force but all the task force or by a
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
vote of the task force I think that
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be a wonderful thing to happen
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
let's take some of the time we have
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
remaining here because there's another
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
hour here to really get down into and
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
can we have a brief discussion uh Fred
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
on some of the issues that you know
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
alluded to the the definitions of
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
Competency proficiency what is the
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
minimum you know minimum bar that we're
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to say that a person is
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
competent is that going to be discussed
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
and decided by the local school
 
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
district uh in terms of or is it going
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
to be as a direct result of the
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment and where they show
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
up on that um and which we don't give to
 
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
all these subject areas and we're going
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
to have uh these standards applicable to
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
areas such as health uh so what how does
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
a district know how to define what that
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
bar is for a graduation competency for a
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
district competency and also to be
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
aligned with our academic
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
standards so um one of the things that I
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
think is one of the more significant
 
01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
changes in the document and and this was
 
01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:16.470 align:start position:0%
changes in the document and and this was
uh

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.029 align:start position:0%
uh
really

01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
um pushed pretty hard by the school
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
administrators Association to have a set
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
of graduation competencies what does it
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
mean to graduate from a New Hampshire
 
01:02:30.359 --> 01:02:31.630 align:start position:0%
mean to graduate from a New Hampshire
High

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
High
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
School and so what our team did led by
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
Brian stack who was then the principal
 
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
of of sanbor Regional High School and
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
David Ryan who was the superintendent of
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
schools in in
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
exor is they looked at at
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
um um at different uh standards
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
competencies uh from a number of states
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
drafted a a grouping of of
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
competencies um for uh uh Broken Out In
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
by subject area so from a math
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint they had a set uh when you
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
know we had a uh Nate ran it but we had
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
a two-day session uh in lonia lonia
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
middle school with 40 to 50 content
 
01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:33.559 align:start position:0%
experts we wanted to show them because
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're the experts not us we wanted to
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
show them what we had come up with and
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
um and I spoke to them uh and I and I
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
said to them okay so we're you know we
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
we've put these together for you to look
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
at as a draft um and uh but you know but
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
you tell us uh you know are these the
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
right ones that need to be changed you
 
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
know whatever you are think that they
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
should look like we're very interested
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
seeing that and and I I made the
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation to them that that they
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
can't look at that set of Standards at
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
that set of
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
competencies um in an aspirational way
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
where gee we'd love it if every kid did
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
this because we're saying these are the
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
graduation competencies here is a bar by
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
which we want every single graduate from
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire High School to get over
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
in math in language arts in whatever uh
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
and you can't set it so
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
low that it becomes a joke so what is
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
that sweet spot that we are willing to
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
say this is what a New Hampshire
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
graduate uh knows and is able to do this
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
is the minimum of what a New Hampshire
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
graduate knows and be able is able to do
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh my sense is that that is a raising of
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
the bar that alone is a raising of the
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
bar because I guarantee we've had kids
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
that have graduated from high school not
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
just in New Hampshire but all over the
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
country that uh that have been you know
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
not meeting some important uh areas you
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
know you raised the subject earlier
 
01:05:23.839 --> 01:05:24.630 align:start position:0%
know you raised the subject earlier
about

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
you know about the the huge amount of of
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
kids that uh go to college and have to
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
take remedial math and or language arts
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
because they didn't get uh you know the
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
the transcript said that they learned um
 
01:05:41.069 --> 01:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
but they really didn't so so this alone
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
to me is one of those one of the things
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
that has been put into the document that
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
we hope and and the school
 
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
administrators were strong about this um
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the commissioner had
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
recommended let's put it in a side
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
document let's put these in a side
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
document so we were looking at that for
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
a while the superintendent came back and
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
said if you put it in the side document
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
they won't pay enough attention to it
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's got to be in the 306s and that in
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
our team the 306 team was like we kind
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
of agree with the superintendent so we
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
went back and forth and ultimately it's
 
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
in the document so um so that is that is
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
one of those things that I think is
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
important in
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
definitions on we put on definitions of
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
Competency Based
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
learning this the this was actually from
 
01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
Mark mlan um uh he said why don't you
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
put the definition from the Aurora
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
Institute which is um the organization
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
recognized around the country as you
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
know either the leader or one of the the
 
01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
the leaders in the um in Competency
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
Based learning why don't you put their
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
definition under you know uh in you know
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
in the definition section for for uh
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
Competency Based letter so that's what
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
we did we put that in so it's becoming
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's clear it's going to be clear
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
to everybody this is the direction this
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
is where we're going so we did have um a
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
bit of an arm wrestle
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
on should we continue to use the word
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
Mastery or should we we use the word
 
01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.510 align:start position:0%
Mastery or should we we use the word
proficiency

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
proficiency
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
instead and I think our team felt that
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
that the education Community would like
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
the word proficiency better than the
 
01:07:36.839 --> 01:07:37.870 align:start position:0%
the word proficiency better than the
word

01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
Mastery um and we we made the change in
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
you know in in the draft and um and we
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
defined proficiency as a minimum level
 
01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.589 align:start position:0%
defined proficiency as a minimum level
of

01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
Mastery and um when we've kind of
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
marched it around to in the listening
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
sessions we really didn't get a lot of
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
support for it I mean it was kind of
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
like a six and one and a half a dozen or
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
the other I don't think that that a
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
whole lot of people cared I you know so
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where that one ultimately
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
ends up um so
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
um th those were the ones that that I I
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
thought you were addressing but I I'll
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
gladly address any other stuff that uh
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
that you want that I think are are
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
significant elements of the minimum
 
01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:24.390 align:start position:0%
significant elements of the minimum
standards

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from
 
01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.309 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from
representative

01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you all for being here the whole
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
task force um to follow up on the
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements um so um the
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation will be part of the draft
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
that you present on um November 9th I
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
take it um to follow up on that um you
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
really didn't get push back on
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
it out you know it was like that you
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
know that was not a we got pushed back
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
on some things we got pushed back on a
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
number of things as you know as anybody
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
Rick or or Mel or or Dave and you guys
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
actually came to sessions and so you saw
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
it was push back so we got a whole bunch
 
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
of things we got push back on that was
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
not one of them right I was just curious
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
about that because we often talk about
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
local control and all and I'm wondering
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
how local school districts will feel to
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
a state set of graduation competencies
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
because we've we've had legislation last
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
year and will again this year about
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
early graduation and what what is the
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
bar how do you measure to allow someone
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
for early graduation U but I guess this
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
minimum set of uh State competencies
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
would accomplish
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
that I I you know again the the
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent felt strongly that that
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
that when are we going to finally
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
say that if you are a graduate from a
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire High School that this is
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
what you know and are able to do when
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
are we going to say that because because
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
we've got um in in essence uh a hundred
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
different um school districts
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
saus um that that could have aspirations
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
all over the place and um are you know
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
we are the state are we you know are are
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
are we acting um as a
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
team philosophically in where we are
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
going it doesn't mean that everybody's
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
doing you know how anybody gets there
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
that's their job that you know for the
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
local leaders to figure out what it is
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
that uh that that uh um that that they
 
01:10:47.709 --> 01:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
are going to do in order to make sure
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
that they get their kids uh over that
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
line so um so uh you know I feel good
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
about is it possible that um we set
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
those standards and um and and give
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
flexibility to school districts if they
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
want to alter it then uh you know then
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
they have the opportunity well that's a
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a thought that uh that
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
certainly makes it possible for
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
something like that thank you just
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
wondering also how do you envision
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
moving towards a system like that of
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
having a state um minimum set of
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements what is the
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
process timeline for moving to uh
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
something um that's considerably
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
different than what we do now I think
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
generally speaking that the that the
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
school dist that the school leaders are
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
going to like it I mean that is the
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
impression that I got that from you know
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
from working with them so um you know I
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
don't know that that you know I said
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
earlier that um you know that uh our
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
education Community has bought in I am
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely convinced they have bought
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
into Competency Based learning they want
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
to do it right they want to do it well
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
and they want the State Department of
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
Education to do um the best job possible
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
in assisting them in getting to the
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
place that they that they feel that they
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
need to go so um so uh it it it it is
 
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to take work I believe that
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know and I I'd like to have Nate
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
speak to this uh a bit because I believe
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
that the department gets it that they're
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
going to have to do um they're going to
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
have to do more to um assist districts
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
in moving in the direction that we're
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
trying to go which in in in reality is
 
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
not any different than the direction in
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
2005 we are not trying to move it in a
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
different direction you read this um
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
this document and you know I had you
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
know because I'm a packrat I I happen to
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of copies of this left over
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
in sitting in my closet when we first
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
put the team together I sent everybody a
 
01:12:59.629 --> 01:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
physical copy of it and then asked them
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
to read the key 21 pages and get back to
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
me with their thoughts and uh it was Val
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
that said it said you know you could
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
really take the 2007 date off of this
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
document put in
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
2021 and it's largely the same thing
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish so this is so
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's not new in the sense that we are
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
handing them this new goal this new
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
Direction no it's the same direction
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
that the state has been trying to go in
 
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
for 20 years so it's so to me I just sit
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
there and say okay 20 years went by like
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
that is another 20 years going to go by
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
like that are we still going to have
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
kids falling through the cracks still
 
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
getting grades C's and DS and passing
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
and still not knowing um what they
 
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
should know to to to earn that New
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire diploma I mean at some point
 
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
in time all of us have to say we're GNA
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
build the best Competency Based model we
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
can we're going to do this as a team and
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
and that team is and we're not talking
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
about forcing up anything upon anybody
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we get the New
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Education Community
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
together I believe that their leadership
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
wants this as bad as any of us do and
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
and they want and they want Flex ility
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
and how they get there and so I think
 
01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
you know I I am feeling good about where
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
we are right now especially with the uh
 
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
um with the way that talks have been
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
going with the school administrators
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
Association Nate do you want to add
 
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
anything to that yeah I think regardless
 
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
of you know any of the changes that go
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
into the minimum standards one of the
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
things that we recognize that my team
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
recognizes of the department is you know
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
there are things that we need to be
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
doing better at we need to be doing
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
better at communication directly with
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
the field and with schools we need to be
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
providing more direct technical
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
assistance and support uh you know when
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative luno talks about the
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
differences in Hopkinton in Newport we
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
see that in the data at the department
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
as well and what we can be doing more of
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
is looking at where we're putting our
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
resources as a department you know it
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily need to be that
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
we're providing the exact same level of
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
support to every school and District but
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
what are the schools and districts that
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
need more support and how do we get the
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
resources from the Department into those
 
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
schools and working directly with those
 
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
teachers with those School leaders um so
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
I see any kind of changes in the minimum
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
standards as you know once we get to
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
that point once we're through the whole
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
process you know what gets approved by
 
01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
the state board we have to be able to
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
provide support and technical assistance
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
directly to schools on what those rules
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
are and how they're being implemented
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
and it has to be a partnership between
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
the department and the schools to get it
 
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
done further questions yes represent
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
Ellison uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
for picking my question uh during all of
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
the discuss Russians uh with the task
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
force has there been any any attention
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
paid to fisical capacity here I we're
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
talking about the department want will
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
have to do more we'll probably need more
 
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
people to do more uh I think local
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
school districts uh in terms of changing
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
will have to do more and that there's a
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal implication here and I I it may
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
not be under the purview of the tax
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to deal with that but it would
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
seem to me that that shortly very
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
shortly we're going to be looking at a
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
at a dollar side and we'll go from there
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
and as you are aware the the dollars uh
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
are scarce uh but I'm just wondering was
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
there any cons is there any
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
consideration about that uh first of all
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
I want to apologize because I was about
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
to say well you know art but then I I
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
recognized that you know I said I said
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
Rick and Dave and Mel like I apologize I
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
I I I I should be saying representative
 
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
luno and representative Miler so anyway
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
my my error and so so representative
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
Ellison I will say that um we did have
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
conversations about capacity about money
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
um uh one of the things that we did that
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
got rejected which we did on this is
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
interesting we did it on purpose purpose
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay we we actually sent something to
 
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
the department that we knew was going to
 
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.189 align:start position:0%
the department that we knew was going to
get

01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
rejected and that was um
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
counselors and we
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
knew they're going to say no I mean they
 
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
have no choice it's an unfunded mandate
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
and and um but all of us our team wanted
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
to make the statement
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
that that you know that standard was
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
probably created in the
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
80s and when we look at the state of
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
mental health that you were talking
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
about earlier rck I'm sorry
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative flat um that that um that
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
um drug issues so many you know so many
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
issues that are are our uh kids are
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with these days that it's
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
the load on Guidance just seemed like
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's not right
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
so we we we sent a recommendation over
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
knowing full well no one was all upset
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
on our end we knew it was going to
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
happen so it got rejected we also had um
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
we also put into the document something
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm really upset that would that is
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to get taken out and that is um or
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
maybe already has been taken out the the
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
idea of personalized learning plans we
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
wanted personalized learning
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
plans and uh the uh School
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
administrators all pretty much said you
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
know nice idea but you know but it's
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a flip of a switch that this is
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
not that easy to do and there have been
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
some states that actually have gone down
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
that road and done it successfully and
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
others that have not been successful at
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
it so the school admin ministrators
 
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
agreed that once we're past the uh the
 
01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
minimum standards that we get together
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
and have a Statewide conversation on how
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
do we do personalized learning
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
plans just I want to correct a little
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
bit of that not that the department
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
rejected it but there are several ideas
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
that were put forward as part of the
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and then the
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
department did a fiscal analysis of what
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
it would cost districts to put that into
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards and then it
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't move for without some plan for
 
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
them providing for schools to be able to
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
provide for those costs um and it's not
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
within the purview of this task force to
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
be able to raise and appropriate funds
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
for schools so I just I want to correct
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
that the department did not reject it
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
but recognize that some of the ideas to
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
be put forward would have um had a price
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
tag of a few million dollars and that
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
recommending that without also
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
recommending a process by which schools
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
could raise those funds um was not part
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
of what this task force could do okay
 
01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just interject here a little
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
bit um I've been down this road in
 
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
education myself as a as a school
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
teacher as a school administrator
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
principal um I can remember when we had
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
to teach the difference to a fourth
 
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
grade Stu student the difference between
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
a number and a
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
numeral they didn't know and you know
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
that wasn't our primary interest in in
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
teaching mathematics and getting these
 
01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.790 align:start position:0%
teaching mathematics and getting these
competencies

01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
across and I have a real concern and we
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
we also have had IEPs and IPS individual
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
plans teachers became managers of paper
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
and less time in a classroom
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
teaching so that and I'm sure represent
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
Myer will agree in that they we that
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
dropped by seeing that it was uh not a
 
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
really efficient use of teaching
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
instruction in the
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
classroom so my concern still lies with
 
01:21:19.159 --> 01:21:20.550 align:start position:0%
classroom so my concern still lies with
these

01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
competencies um we've had competenc se's
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
written in statute for many years
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
now and we do know that there are some
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
students that move from one school to
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
another they have taken a course in the
 
01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
previous school but it's not in the
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
scope and sequence of curriculum
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
offerings in the receiving school
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
they're made to take the course again
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
they don't have the opp option of taking
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
a as they should according to your rules
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's 43 courses each school is
 
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to have have high schoolwise
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to have competency
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
assessments to determine that do schools
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
have this in place or is it something
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
that just hasn't happened um and you
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
know some are doing it I've been to some
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
schools in the state where they're
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
they're on board they're doing this and
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
it's working other schools are not so
 
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
what's being done to make those schools
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
that are not accountable for what we
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
already have in
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
statute so I think the times where we've
 
01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
seen that have been really when a
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
student has taken a course at VX this
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
tends to be the most common thing and
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
then they bring that course back to say
 
01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
their their um public resident District
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
that they might be attending I know and
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
I believe it was not last year but two
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
years ago there was a statute that was
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
passed that required schools to accept
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
the credits from any other approved
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
School within the state of New Hampshire
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
um since the passage of that statute my
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
office hasn't received any uh complaints
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
of that occurring with students I'm not
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
saying it's not occurring but we were
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
seeing a frequency of complaints prior
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
to the passage to that statute and since
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
then we haven't seen that we saw Val and
 
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
I saw it on the crew technical education
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
where a student couldn't go to a CTE
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
class simply because that one math or
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
one science course was offered at the
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
same time and even though the courses
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
are the program they were enrolled in at
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
the CTE taught the same
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
competencies that we finally got
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
something done where there's an
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
agreement between the the sending and
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
the receiving but uh it's
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh I I fear that we have some
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
schools that don't have these compass in
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
place for the kid that moves into town
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
and said I took Algebra 1 in junior high
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
school because I had pre pre-algebra in
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
the sixth grade that's occurring in
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
places in our country today but you get
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
to that receiving school oh no we only
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
teach Algebra 1 to our
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
freshmen if you take it in the junior
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
high school or middle school level
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
you're math immature and you're not
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
going to get it uh so uh there there's
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
some issues I think we have to do in
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
order to get these these District
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
competencies in place with what the
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
competencies are that we're looking
 
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
these minimum targets what you're
 
01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
talking about here for
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
proficiency uh absolutely and and I
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
think really what what I see you
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
describing is a 20th century system and
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know in a in a 20 first century
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
system we should that student should be
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
able to in any in any way
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh prove that he or she has uh is
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
proficient in those competencies and be
 
01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:29.719 align:start position:0%
done they should not have to you know
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
they should not have to be forced to go
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
back in and do a course all over again
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
and and and if and if uh they're missing
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh let's say that there are a handful of
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
competencies that are required for a
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
particular course and they're clearly
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
proficient in in four out of the five of
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
them well they should not have to go do
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
the the whole course they should they
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
should I I have no problem with the
 
01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
school saying you know we're not giving
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
credit until we know that you're
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
proficient in all of them and so you can
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
do vac we can you know here's a here's a
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
number of ways that we can approach the
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
the deficiency and ensure that the the
 
01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.310 align:start position:0%
the deficiency and ensure that the the
uh

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
student gets where they need to go in an
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
efficient manner so um I think that you
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
know some of those same frustrations
 
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh lots of people have about uh the
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
deficiencies of the old model but I
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
think in a competency based model if
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's done well that stuff should be
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
addressed did your did your group
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
address the issue then do the schools
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
have in place a
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
competency assessment or review to to
 
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
decide yeah they got these four but
 
01:25:47.629 --> 01:25:47.639 align:start position:0%
they're missing this fifth one um so we
 
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
can make that fifth one up and you'll
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
get credit for this course do they have
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
the competenc Assessments in place to
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
work so there there are requirements
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
within the 306s that require districts
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
to either have a locally developed
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
assessment of those competencies or be
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
able to lean on state approved
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
assessments of competencies the addition
 
01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
of the state approved assessments was
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
something that I believe was added in
 
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
just in the last couple of years and so
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
the stateboard has looked at um or plans
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
to look at some national uh types of
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
assessments things like assessments
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
through college board and AP assessments
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
through ETS or practice that could
 
01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
fulfill that job that are are nationally
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
recognized assessments of of student
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge um but up to this point no
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
it's all based off of what the local
 
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
school district has developed for the
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of measuring the local school
 
01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.910 align:start position:0%
purpose of measuring the local school
district

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
competencies BR Miler you had a question
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
yeah Fred I think you should be
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
congratulated in attempting to go out
 
01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
into the field and and get information
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
and it sounds to me in your testimony
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
this morning that you're intent is to
 
01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
try to engage uh more individuals in the
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
next several days before the final draft
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
so I think as I look out to the audience
 
01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
the committee here there's there's
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
anxiety around what that what that draft
 
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
the redraft is going to look like based
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
upon all the input that you have
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
received so um I think we should rate uh
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
resist any other comments around the the
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
current draft since it seems to be
 
01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
irrelevant now based upon what you're
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
going to be doing so I I so thank you I
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
want a followup question uh with Rick's
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with competencies one of the
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
issues here with your Competency Based
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
education is that obviously there will
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
be opportunities for students to uh
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
receive that competency outside the
 
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
school uh the question that I guess I
 
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
really have is how do you make sure that
 
01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.109 align:start position:0%
really have is how do you make sure that
there's

01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
quality in the same rigor that you would
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
have in school for a particular class
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
how do you ensure that that same quality
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
and rigor will take place in an
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
experience a learning experience for a
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
student in outside system uh what's your
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
what's your sense of how that's going to
 
01:28:10.639 --> 01:28:12.709 align:start position:0%
what's your sense of how that's going to
take

01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
place my sense is that um that that will
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
be done at the school level and um you
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
know I I I I wish I could say that that
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
you know just doing it the way we've
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
traditionally done it is good enough I
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't think it's good enough I mean I
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know I would like to think that if
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're really um if we're really uh
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
understanding at the local level what it
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
means um to have uh to be proficient or
 
01:28:49.229 --> 01:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
have mastered the competencies that
 
01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
somehow this student has to demonstrate
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
that that he or she knows this in in in
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
a way that they can use it in known and
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
unknown situations in the future and
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
they're not going to just forget it two
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
weeks later like it you know so many
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
including me you know did with tests
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
where he studied for the test passed the
 
01:29:13.149 --> 01:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
test and a couple weeks later forgot you
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
know so much of it that to me is not
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
it's is not good enough so I'd like to
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
think that whatever we are doing um is
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
holding kids to higher standards if
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
we're if to me just a competency based
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
model alone is higher holding uh
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
students to higher standards so um you
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
know that uh how each School deals with
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure what would what would
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
what would you add to to what you know
 
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
question um looking at credits outside
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
of the classroom often times we look at
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
the ELO programs um and the specific
 
01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
policies that districts have developed
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
around you know things either moving
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
through their ELO coordinators or
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
approved by the school principal um each
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
district sort of has their own set of of
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
policies for how they approve those ELO
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities and those outside the
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
classroom credit opportunities that the
 
01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:05.719 align:start position:0%
District offers okay as a followup
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
please I think that's clear particular
 
01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
with the ELO system that we have the
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
question I have is in the learn
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
everywhere program when you have an
 
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
experience there Dr Green what is the
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
oversight on the part of the Department
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
of Education in in those uh institutions
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
businesses whatever they might be to
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
ensure because there's that in that
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
situation School District isn't
 
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily involved in that learn
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere program what is the role that
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
the department plays in making sure that
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's rigor within the competencies
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh the learn ort program uh
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
exists outside of the 306s they have a
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
separate section it's the ed400 there is
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
a review process that the department
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
undertakes for any program that comes in
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
and applies to be a Lear ever program um
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
and then that review process and the
 
01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
results of that go to the State Board um
 
01:31:04.109 --> 01:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
but ultimately it's the State Board of
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
Education that approves learn everware
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
programs and the Department of Education
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
um tries to provide some review of those
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
those programs But ultimately goes to
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
the State Board of
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
Education further questions yes
 
01:31:16.719 --> 01:31:19.030 align:start position:0%
Education further questions yes
representative

01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I think I would tend to agree with
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
the the sort of 20,000 foot view of
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
Competency Based idea I I have a little
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
bit of a concern when I'm trying to you
 
01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
know meet rubber with Road and trying to
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
figure out the the details of how this
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
works so if uh if I could I think I have
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
two questions the first of which so
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
you've got traditional
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
classrooms um X number of students in
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
the class you have a you have a teacher
 
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
you may have other Professionals in the
 
01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.669 align:start position:0%
you may have other Professionals in the
classroom

01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh curriculum is delivered everybody is
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
more or less on the same page and they
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
move along at the same time but moving
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
to a a competency based model where you
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
can't move on until you've achieved
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
either proficiency or Mastery at a
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
certain level suggests that every
 
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
student could potentially be at a
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
different place which necessitates a
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
personalized learning for each student
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
so rubber meeting Road this would seem
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
to either require a exponential increase
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
than the number of teachers or a heavy
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
Reliance on technology to deliver that
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
so is is that what we're looking at here
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
is leaning on technology things like
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence and other
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
programs to help individualize learning
 
01:32:35.199 --> 01:32:39.229 align:start position:0%
programs to help individualize learning
for

01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
students it's it's a good question and I
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to speak not necessarily as
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
a a current Department representative
 
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
but as a former High School teacher that
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
had to implement Competency Based
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
systems in my chemistry and physics
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
classes um one of the ways in which I
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
did that was a little bit more old
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
school as opposed to newer Tech although
 
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
I actually as a science teeder love
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
technology and tried to integrate that
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
as much into my classroom um we actually
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
created a one wall of our classroom
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
essentially was a game board um and so
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
all the different squares across the
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
board were all the different
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
competencies that students had to move
 
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
through and with you know 25 or 26 kids
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
at any given point you might have a
 
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
group of five or six kids that are on
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
one competency a group of seven or eight
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
that are on another competency um and it
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
shifts the learning a little bit where
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
instead of and we had 90 minute blocks
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
we had an hour and a half so as opposed
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
to say you know lecturing for 45 minutes
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
and doing a lab activity um I would
 
01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
maybe lecture for 25 or 30 minutes and
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
provide some additional homework where
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
kids would go home and they might watch
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
a video come in do a lab and as kids
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
would complete the you know whether it's
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
a a quiz or a test or a lab assignment
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
they' be able to move on to that next
 
01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:51.400 align:start position:0%
competency was it harder absolutely um
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
was was it doable yes it just requires a
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
little bit more of Shifting when you're
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
providing some of that instruction being
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
able to wrap some of the instruction
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
into what kids brought home with them if
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
they could go home and watch a video on
 
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
you know the Discovery Education website
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
and come in they got a little bit of
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
that content as opposed to just relying
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
on me being the person to deliver that
 
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
direct instruction and that way in the
 
01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
classroom I could work more directly
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
with groups of students as opposed to
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
just standing up in front of the whole
 
01:34:21.109 --> 01:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
group now I would say that was my
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
experience as a a single individual
 
01:34:24.669 --> 01:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
teacher trying to implement competence
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
based systems um I think there's a lot
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
of different ways of doing it much of it
 
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
does involve technology much of it
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
involves different groupings of students
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
so how are you grouping your kids within
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
your classroom and relying on kids
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
working together and supporting each
 
01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
other almost through kind of like a peer
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
tutoring system within those
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
groups yes represent you have followup
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I'd like to answer it too
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
but but go ahead yes I just
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you yes I just had one um one
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
followup uh which um is to the nature of
 
01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
the competencies themselves I've looked
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
through a bunch of them and obviously
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're what you would expect for the
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
most part but I I wanted to ask are
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
there any or would you Advocate that
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
there would be any nonacademic
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
competencies involved in this such as
 
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
competencies based around social
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
competencies or emotional competencies
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
or things of that nature so that's
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
that's where you see um districts
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
creating those competencies for their
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
Community um you see this especially
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the school districts that
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
have adopted the portrait of a graduate
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
where they're looking at you know not
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
just the academic skills um but also
 
01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
work skills social and emotional skills
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
what is it that they want to see for a
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
well-rounded student when they leave
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
high school and so many districts have
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
adopted specific competencies for their
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
schools and districts that go beyond
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
just say a math competency or an Ela
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
competency they get to some of those
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
softare skills or some of those work
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
coming um if I could follow up a little
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
bit on representative bel's question
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
taking this a little bit further if you
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
have a class that is in different points
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
um will you have a a year of class
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
freshmen or sophomores that are at
 
01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
different points and some don't move on
 
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
to what we would consider regularly as
 
01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
the next grade do you have people
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
straddling grades do we do you have the
 
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
classes 77 anymore or is it just
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
whenever you finished your proficiencies
 
01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.030 align:start position:0%
whenever you finished your proficiencies
you're

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
done we we tend to see it more um
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
influencing the numbers of students and
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
the groups of students that need
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
learning over the summer so
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
traditionally you know in non-competent
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
based systems you might have some
 
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
students that didn't quite get to the
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
point where they're ready they might
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
come in and do summer school now we're
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
seeing uh summer school be a little bit
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
more directed from a competency based
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
perspective where students have a set of
 
01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
competencies that they didn't Master
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
during the school year they were just in
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
and they're working over the summer to
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
master those um sometimes with a
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
coordinator from the school sometimes um
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
with the specific teacher that they had
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
had the course with it really sort of
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
depends on the school and District
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
policies but we really see that being
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
directed more towards those summer
 
01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
learning programs thank
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
you yes represent
 
01:37:13.629 --> 01:37:13.639 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much uh Rick Fred
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
and Nate so so uh I you know I I think I
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
think I'll I mean Rick really should
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
should speak for all of us but we
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
probably don't take ourselves too
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
seriously but we take the work very
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
seriously oh I take myself seriously oh
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
sure but I can still call you
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
RIT yes so but um but uh thanks very
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and and U I wanted to sort
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
of swing back around to something you
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
talked about um a little bit earlier and
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and I think you were looking for for
 
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
feedback probably from the oversight um
 
01:37:50.669 --> 01:37:50.679 align:start position:0%
uh committee on uh on things like
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements and so so uh
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
again going back to you know my time on
 
01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
local school board uh we don't I I think
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
we don't in New Hampshire put a whole
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
lot of requirements on our students and
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
and uh I mean we do put some um I think
 
01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
for graduation I just looked it up four
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
English three math two science a couple
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
of history and social studies and then a
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
half credit and a smattering of
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
different uh things but um but uh but uh
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
six um six credits in electives and
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's just you know the minimum 20 um
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
20 credit standard a lot of districts
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
have 22 24 26 credits and uh and
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
probably load up on a lot of uh
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
electives maybe some put world you know
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
uh World language in uh in there uh too
 
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
but um but uh you know as as I recall
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
student voice and choice is something
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's a real important component uh
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
particularly if you want to address what
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
what Fred what you wereing talking about
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
earlier keeping kids interested in
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
school and um and and a lot of times
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
voice voice and choice uh touch on these
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
things that that representative beler
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
was talking about outside of the normal
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
Academic Program um you know for example
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of kids show up to school because
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
they want to go to football practice and
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
they want to play in the game on
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
Saturday and and that's what gets them
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
to come into school and sit through math
 
01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
class English class social studies class
 
01:39:22.109 --> 01:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
everything else and and uh and uh and
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
they they they pick up some academics uh
 
01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
and lunch along the uh uh along the way
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
but um but a couple of years ago I think
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
we saw you know an attack on on the um
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
what what what what I think is sort of
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
laid out as the the minimum program that
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
high schools have to offer which is
 
01:39:44.669 --> 01:39:44.679 align:start position:0%
pretty well defined in
 
01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:49.159 align:start position:0%
193e and um and and the um the the
 
01:39:52.270 --> 01:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
justification for that was again back to
 
01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
the Newport um question like if if
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're really not if they're struggling
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
in math and science and English in the
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
required uh elements then why require a
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
school to do any more than the than the
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
required um elements and um and my
 
01:40:12.910 --> 01:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
concern is that takes away from voice
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
and choice for uh for the students to
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
fill out these electives whether that's
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
eight credit hour
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
you know or whatever eight credits in um
 
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
in unified arts in wood shop in framing
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
in in all these things that that that we
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
don't specify but but I was wondering if
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
you could talk a little bit on on the
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
connection um that the 306s uh could
 
01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:43.239 align:start position:0%
have towards student voice and choice
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
gradu minimum graduation requirements
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
and then a a a program of studies that
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
that that really sort of provide
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
students with the voice and choice to be
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
able to graduate from high school with
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
with something that's meaningful and
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
important to them absolutely thank you
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
so much for asking representative
 
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
luno so um we um in working with uh as
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
representative Myer knows uh Tom rafo's
 
01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
group uh the the uh New Hampshire
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
Coalition for business and education um
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%

01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
brokered a an agreement um
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
between the Coalition and the school
 
01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:34.990 align:start position:0%
between the Coalition and the school
administrators

01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
Association on a new vision for high
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
school and that new vision for high
 
01:41:40.679 --> 01:41:41.950 align:start position:0%
school and that new vision for high
school

01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
says that by 2025 obviously we're
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
creeping up on it now by 2025 virtually
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
every New Hampshire High School student
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
will earn or be on a personalized path
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
to earning a post-secondary or career
 
01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.629 align:start position:0%
to earning a post-secondary or career
related

01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
credential so when I mentioned earlier
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
about Senate Bill
 
01:42:05.589 --> 01:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
276 it felt like you guys were having
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
credentials of a Kid's Choice a
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
student's choice in um in a an area that
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
he or she would would want to pursue
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
should be available to virtually every
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
student in high school uh and and and
 
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
the school administrators have agreed
 
01:42:32.669 --> 01:42:32.679 align:start position:0%
with that so how do we get to that place
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
but the so the choice is really and I
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
say this uh I've said this a million
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
times that the public schools need to
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
steal the word choice away from the
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
school choice folks so who say know you
 
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
can choose this school or choose that
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
school the way I phras it's like that's
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
20th century uh thinking on school
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
choice 21st century thinking on school
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
choice inside of a public system and you
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
can do you can have Limitless
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities available to you and they
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
can be inside a classroom they can be
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
online they can be in a real world
 
01:43:16.109 --> 01:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
environment not possible if all we have
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
are traditional classroom opportunities
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
so when I say that I want kids waking up
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
in the morning they are so excited they
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
can't wait to get to school it's because
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
they're pursuing stuff that they want
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
for them not that the school wants for
 
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
them but that they want for them that
 
01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:36.679 align:start position:0%
they see that this is something I can
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
use um to help me pursue my life path
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
whether it be college or career that
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
that we get that done in high school
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
with kids actually earning
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
credentials that are you know and I've
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
said a million times you tell me you
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
have a high school diploma I have no
 
01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
idea what you know I have no idea what
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
you know you get a high school
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
diploma if you tell me you have a
 
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
welding license I kind of have an idea
 
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
of what you know you tell me you have an
 
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
associates degree and something I have
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
an idea of what you know you tell me
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
that you know you have some kind of a
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
credential this
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
institution um certifies that uh Joe
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
Smith has um has achieved the level of
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
such and such hanging on your wall frame
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
it can't take that away from me I can
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
take this out and get a real job that to
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
me is the direction that we need to
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
think about giving that opportunity for
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
our kids and I will tell you you know
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
when our kids start pursuing their
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
passion the things that they want
 
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
because we've done the right job
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
harnessing all of the assets of New
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the businesses nonprofits
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
talented individuals folks that have the
 
01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity and the desire to provide
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
something exciting for our Public
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
Schools then we're going to be Someplace
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
Special you know I've often said you go
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
down the way to tell if we're there is
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
you go down on on Elm Street in
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
Manchester and and you grab anybody off
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
the street say how do we go about
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
educating our kids here um the way
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
they'd say now well we pick them up in
 
01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
the bus in the morning we take them to
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
school 180 days blah blah blah okay when
 
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
that can change so that the average
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
person on the street can say the entire
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
community participates in the process of
 
01:45:43.149 --> 01:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
Education our professional Educators
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
coordinate it all and it's driven
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
largely by our students with their
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
interest and dreams they are given the
 
01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:53.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pursue their their own
 
01:45:57.629 --> 01:45:57.639 align:start position:0%
paths that's when we'll know we have a
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
um a to me a real system a real
 
01:46:03.629 --> 01:46:03.639 align:start position:0%
Competency Based system A system that is
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
going to serve our kids we're a fair way
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
from there to me that's the only way we
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
get there is if we all kind of go you
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
know and you know maybe you'd shape what
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
I just said differently that's fine
 
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
let's all get together and come to an
 
01:46:24.910 --> 01:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
agreement on what that thing is going to
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
look like and then let's all pursue it
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
in a way that that's the kind of
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
education we're going to offer our kids
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
and to me that would be
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
exciting follow yes so so thanks Fred
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
but isn't that happening already in a
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
lot of places between between expansive
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
um uh program studies
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
El we are getting down the path that
 
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
that when when we first when I handed
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
this out to the team and I asked them
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
their thoughts um I asked how far down
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
the path do you think we are I mean you
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
know with this this 2005 2007 vision and
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
and the team answer was somewhere in the
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
20 to 25% of the way there not every
 
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
school some schools much farther down
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
the path others even be behind that
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
um but so excuse me
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
know I I you know I I I have been you
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
know you know called a dreamer many
 
01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
times so and I accept it um but to me
 
01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:43.149 align:start position:0%
times so and I accept it um but to me
excuse

01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
doable it's only doable if if we're if
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
we're if we're having the kinds of
 
01:47:55.149 --> 01:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
discussions like we're having here and
 
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
and and making decisions that are
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to put our kids in
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
those kinds of positions so that they
 
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
can we can create that that great system
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
that that is built for the 21st century
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
not designed off of this old model that
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
really doesn't work for a huge hunk of
 
01:48:22.109 --> 01:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
kids you know it it uh uh the you know
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
the uh uh I you know I was lucky I I
 
01:48:29.709 --> 01:48:29.719 align:start position:0%
found a uh I had a passion I had two
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
passions kids and rock and roll those
 
01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
were my two passions and I pursued both
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
of them and they were and it it provided
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
me with a a very very rewarding life not
 
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
every kid who finishes at the bottom of
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
his or her class like uh like I did
 
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
comes out in a good spot you know a lot
 
01:48:53.589 --> 01:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
of them it it uh the the thought that
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
they're not bright it it becomes a
 
01:48:58.589 --> 01:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
self-fulfilling prophecy and they have
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
they have uh they don't um they just
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that they're special and so
 
01:49:06.910 --> 01:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
and and and maybe don't pursue the kinds
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
of things that they might have if they
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
if they only were put in a position to
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
um to be a star in whatever it was that
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
they wanted to become a star in I became
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
a star in the rock and roll business in
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know musical instruments and um but
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
it was it was a something I was
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
passionate about and uh you know and it
 
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
worked for me and you know and it it
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
changed my own vision of myself because
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
I thought I was Dumb and um and after a
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
while I started thinking maybe I'm not
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
as dumb as I thought and we've got to
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have a system that is
 
01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:51.560 align:start position:0%
not designed and and and to me this this
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
is the system we have it is designed for
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
kids for kids like my wife who who want
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
to sit in the classroom listen to the
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
teacher make you know take great notes
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
get an A on the test get the gold star
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
in her forehead that's what she did and
 
01:50:12.990 --> 01:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
she loved it she's still a teacher and a
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
great one um the you know but for kids
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
like me that didn't work and so how do
 
01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
we have a system that works for every
 
01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:25.639 align:start position:0%
kid and that's that's what you know
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I am hoping that together we
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
can all agree on what this looks like um
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
on what you know what the shape of this
 
01:50:40.270 --> 01:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
um looks like uh and you know and I
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
believe this is doable I absolutely
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
believe this is doable but it's going to
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
take it's going to take leadership it's
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
going to take a concerted effort and a
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
belief on everybody's part that we can
 
01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
pull this off okay I I have a question
 
01:50:57.069 --> 01:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
then then Katie I'll get to you um I'm
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
still little bit concerned about what
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
who establishes the proficient level I'm
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
a I'm a US history teacher let's say
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
and there is no Statewide assessment in
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
those areas we have it in Reading Lang
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
language arts writing science
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
mathematics that's it so so I am going
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
to have to develop that District level
 
01:51:31.149 --> 01:51:31.159 align:start position:0%
competency or or am I not uh uh where
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
where do I find the state competency the
 
01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
proficient level of Competency for US
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
history or do I write my own
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
competencies and every teacher here is
 
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
going to write something different so
 
01:51:45.629 --> 01:51:45.639 align:start position:0%
and then you have schools that are
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
accredited here with the New England
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
neie and you have another one over from
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
the northwest Association schools and
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
colleges they're coming in accredited is
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
that the standard we're reverting to is
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
that of an accrediting institution or
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
some kind of Competency set Prof at a
 
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
professional level by the
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
state so um thank you U so much of that
 
01:52:12.189 --> 01:52:12.199 align:start position:0%
is done as part of the curriculum work
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
that curriculum teams do in schools and
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
districts um often times it's done with
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
a a team of teachers either working
 
01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
within a subject or within a subject and
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
across grade bands so uh in my example
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh when I was a teacher we would get
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
together every year as a science
 
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
department and we would look at all of
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
the science competencies that we had
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
developed for all the different science
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
courses and this is one of the reasons
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
why so much of that is done at a local
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
level because you need sets of
 
01:52:40.830 --> 01:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
competencies for every course that you
 
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
have and oftentimes districts have a
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
wide variety of courses but we also
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
leaned heavily on the work that we knew
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
was happening in the districts around us
 
01:52:51.069 --> 01:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
um and we leaned heavily on the work
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we knew was being done at the
 
01:52:53.709 --> 01:52:53.719 align:start position:0%
middle school because we had to have an
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the Middle School
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
teachers were teaching and what the
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
Middle School teachers were considering
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
proficient so that we understood the
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
level at which the students were coming
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
to us in high school oftentimes our
 
01:53:04.830 --> 01:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
professional development days would
 
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
include some days where the high school
 
01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
team and the middle school team would
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
meet together to look at those
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
curricular progressions across you know
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
fifth grade through 12th grade to make
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
sure that students were were building
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
along a path of proficiency that made
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
sense so that those students were
 
01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
prepared each year um but so much of
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
that work is the work of building a
 
01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum and building competencies
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's done at a local level um
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
some districts have curriculum directors
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
or curriculum administrators that help
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
to lead that work within the district
 
01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
but it it's really done on a you know a
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
course specific basis because every
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
course has to have a set of competencies
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
attached to that and then I would say
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
too it's it's a little bit less about
 
01:53:45.069 --> 01:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
you know grading whether a student got a
 
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
70% or an 80% or 90% um but you know if
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
you have you know chemistry course there
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
going to be 10 or 12 competencies
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
associated with that course and within
 
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
the curriculum you're going to have a
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
set of very specific assignments for
 
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
each of those competencies that a
 
01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
student has to complete those
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
assignments with a level of proficiency
 
01:54:06.189 --> 01:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
to be considered proficient on that
 
01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
particular competency and it could
 
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
include a collection of uh laboratory
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
ports uh student writing uh quiz or unit
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
test but it's usually not just one thing
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
that determines a student set of
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
proficiency but students's performance
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
across a variety of different types of
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
Assessments that then leads to the
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
teacher saying yes on this particular
 
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
competency that student is proficient um
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that really is done at the teacher
 
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
level so it's a local issue yeah
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instruction very much is
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
driven by local teachers yeah yeah Katie
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative petno yes it's
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative Pell chairman lad thank
 
01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome thank you for being
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
here and thank you for taking my
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
question um Mr veronte you've mentioned
 
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
school choice several times um and I'm
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
wondering and and you also mentioned
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
meeting every child's needs and meeting
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
their interests and passions would do
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
you recommend doing this within their
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
assigned school districts or would or
 
01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
would you be open to the concept of
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
opening the borders of the districts for
 
01:55:13.149 --> 01:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
open enrollment across the districts in
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
order to meet these students
 
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
needs uh personally uh I am a anytime
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
any place anyhow any Pace kind of person
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh so um I have uh I have uh no problem
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
doing whatever is in the best interest
 
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
of the student um I the the simple
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
example that I used to give can't give
 
01:55:40.589 --> 01:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
it anymore um be um because of a recent
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
change but I I I used to say what if we
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
have I live in Durham so what if we have
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
in our district this this um 63 240 lb
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
kid that you know runs
 
01:56:00.189 --> 01:56:00.199 align:start position:0%
the99 and um
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
and uh but we don't have a football team
 
01:56:08.189 --> 01:56:08.199 align:start position:0%
at Oyster River um shouldn't you know I
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
mean this is the possibility of of of
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
giving this kid an opportunity to get a
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
college scholarship or what else
 
01:56:18.189 --> 01:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that that student be able to
 
01:56:22.109 --> 01:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
go to a school where he or she can um
 
01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
you know can get that kind of
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity I I I found out recently o
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
River has joined with Portsmouth so now
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
that so now the kids can play on the on
 
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
the Portsmouth team so you know so I
 
01:56:38.069 --> 01:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
like those kinds of choices so you know
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
to me I've always said that if we're
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get this Vision done inside
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
the walls of our schools it'll never
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
happen that we need our community we
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
need the entire Community to make this
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
happen and some of my Republican friends
 
01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
don't like me saying this but Hillary
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
Clinton was right when she said it takes
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
a village it's like it really requires
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
all of us to be in this the community
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
needs to say we're part of the process
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
of educating our kids and um and to and
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
and to me uh that's if we do that well
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
then um then the sky the limit for the
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
possibilities that can offer our our
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
students so you know so I hope I
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
answered the
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
question uh represent Woodcock thank you
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
chairman L good afternoon gentlemen
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for being here
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
um I I I appreciate your passion I I
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
thought it was back in uh grad school
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
with education philosophy 101 it was
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's all the things we can dream I I
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
believe that and I believe in the
 
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
particularly the evaluation of CTE and
 
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
how those skills are very clearly
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
defined you can tell you put the SAR in
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
one way or the other it doesn't work we
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
got that um however a couple of things I
 
01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
I were asked I was confused about
 
01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative whatever the name is p
 
01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
my right asked a couple times about the
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
finances and you sort of just let that
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
go representative chair asked about the
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
competencies in place now and I I think
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
um they were supposed to be put in place
 
01:58:13.390 --> 01:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
by starting 2004 in in every school now
 
01:58:16.109 --> 01:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
that's correct to be there some comp is
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
when the regul went in place the the the
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the uh minimum standards
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
actually said that this must be in place
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
by the 2009 2010 school year right so it
 
01:58:31.229 --> 01:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in place a decade ago and
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative lad's question was if I
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
understood it was he was asking you if
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
doe had everything done anything about
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
checking on that making sure all the
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
schools did that and you the respon the
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
response was basically no um we we they
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
hadn't done that but understand not no
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
but not good enough is my in my opinion
 
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay then there is a mechanism that de
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes going down to schools and checked on
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
besid just sleep check off okay good so
 
01:58:56.669 --> 01:58:56.679 align:start position:0%
I will get to my question by the way
 
01:59:00.430 --> 01:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
that that 240 pound 100 99 Dash somebody
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
would find him he would get an education
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
he would he would be he would be found
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
we get where we live but my question is
 
01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
this I agree with you um we used to call
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
it performance evaluation then we call
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
it authentic assessment now we call it
 
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
compens it's all the same thing show us
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
what you can do and how you can be I got
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
all that but is I don't know if any
 
01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
school system where they have teachers
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
in there saying I don't want you to show
 
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
me how you can do it but we show it this
 
01:59:28.510 --> 01:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
way but what we have is school system
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
that are desparate and they're desperate
 
01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
because their funny base and their
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for youngsters comes on
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
their funny base so I was thinking back
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
because I don't know Chinese education
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
but I do had your quote that said more
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
kids in AP schools in China than they
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
are in New Hampshire at all I wrote that
 
01:59:50.830 --> 01:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
down and I said I wonder who funds the
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
schools in China I wonder about that I
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
wonder if was the property taxes funded
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
the schools in China I don't know do you
 
02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
know that I heard your qu you quote I
 
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
think the government does oh okay so
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's just so it goes back to my
 
02:00:08.069 --> 02:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
point my my point is this that the
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of it's authentic or
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
performance or companies and I like that
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
I was in systems I had a chance to work
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
in those types of systems and I believe
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
in that and I believe that every
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
youngster has the right to get that go
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
but then I think there has to be
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
some strong creative step or uh Movement
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
by this committee Beyond just saying
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to comery base and
 
02:00:32.350 --> 02:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
every school is going to do it and this
 
02:00:34.189 --> 02:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
is what you going do it still leaves the
 
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
void in how are you going to fund it and
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
if you continue to leave that void am I
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
talking Li can't hear well if you
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
continue to leave that void that says
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
you're going depend on taxpayers yeah
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's wood you get it uh taxpayers then
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
is not going to work because there's no
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
school system with teachers that I know
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
say we don't want it to work now they're
 
02:00:56.669 --> 02:00:56.679 align:start position:0%
trying to make it work they don't have
 
02:00:59.229 --> 02:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
the resources so is your committee going
 
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
to have some supplement that's going to
 
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
say you know what folks if you really
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
want to change the system and you want
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
to make it eligible for everyone to
 
02:01:08.669 --> 02:01:08.679 align:start position:0%
change the system you have to give
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
everyone the same opportunity and that's
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
resources so I is your Comm stepping
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
forward to say that as well or or am I
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
just mistaken um well you're mistaken
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
but I love what you're saying and in in
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
the sense that that I mean I have been
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
fighting the education funding fight
 
02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:29.510 align:start position:0%
fighting the education funding fight
since

02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:01:34.069 --> 02:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
1992 and um and I have a plaque on my
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
wall um uh that myself and two others uh
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
in 1995 one the Josiah Bartlet better
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
government uh award for our plan for a
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
flat tax on property to fund an adequate
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire's Public
 
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
Schools it was the introduction of the
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
modern day concept of the State Property
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
Tax the state property tax in my opinion
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
which has nothing to do with this
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee and I wish it would but it I
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
mean because I'd love the responsibility
 
02:02:07.149 --> 02:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
of working with folks on on education
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
funding but education I've I've argued I
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
got the opportunity to argue before the
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court on this
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
issue so I know the issue very well I
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with you um but that has
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
nothing to do not nothing to do it has
 
02:02:24.430 --> 02:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
certainly has something to do with how
 
02:02:27.069 --> 02:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know how well our schools are are
 
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
are uh are funded and and uh but but our
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
our committee can't can't address that
 
02:02:37.229 --> 02:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
by that uh so it's not part of our
 
02:02:40.030 --> 02:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
charge I wish it was it's not part of
 
02:02:43.470 --> 02:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
our charge and um you know so I and and
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
even when this committee is done I will
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
personally continue uh
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
pursuing um the the whole notion of
 
02:02:55.350 --> 02:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
doing education funding
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
right real quick you're into my lunch
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
hour oh you're light either that's
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay T one brief question yeah that that
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
being said um sir I understand your
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
passion for funding as most people here
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh have the same passion but that
 
02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to the question and the
 
02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
question is if and I understand your
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
background for the first 20 minutes with
 
02:03:22.910 --> 02:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
your background and I appreciate that so
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
I know where you're coming from that
 
02:03:26.189 --> 02:03:26.199 align:start position:0%
being said however is this committee
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to be bold enough in their
 
02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
introduction of their passion to the to
 
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
the uh state board and to the D over
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
here is the next level to say that all
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is great if it is funded I mean you
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
I understand not you charge but that is
 
02:03:41.709 --> 02:03:41.719 align:start position:0%
part of the the basket that's the
 
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
wrapping on the basket you can't get to
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
the basket without all the rapping so my
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
question is are is is your commune going
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
to say if this is could but can't work
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
on the funding system we have
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
now uh it it is well can it work on the
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
now yeah I I I believe it can work with
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
the funding system that we have now is
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
it going to work well with the funding
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
system we have now uh I have a problem
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
with the funding system that we have now
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
personally but we're on another subject
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's like it's like you know you're
 
02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
asking me to put a different hat on I
 
02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
get the Hat ask stand up when you make
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
presentation to the state and say this
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
will work if we fund it that's all I'm
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
asking representative we're really off
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
topic here and we're you know I'm going
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
to allow one more question represent
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
Damon you haven't had anything to say
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
here but we have to take a break here
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
because we have another one starting up
 
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock in this room represent
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I've actually
 
02:04:43.870 --> 02:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
had a lot to say in my head um however I
 
02:04:45.629 --> 02:04:45.639 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that the
 
02:04:49.709 --> 02:04:49.719 align:start position:0%
word Equity be articulated in this room
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
now and a recognition that the draft of
 
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
the standards that we currently have
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
available to look
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
at completely erods any attention to
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
equity for students and uh educating
 
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
professionals and I would hope that the
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
revised draft would be much more like
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
what we are currently operating under
 
02:05:14.589 --> 02:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
and that Equity would be clearly stated
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
as a need for schools to address thank
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much uh Nate and Fred
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
for can I can I just have Nate address
 
02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
that for just one second representative
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
for sure was there a question in
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
there kind of a question and I'd like
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
I'd love for Nate to respond I know
 
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
you'd like to respond you have a he
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
respon I don't know if it's
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
interrogative sense a question or what
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead sure so there was an
 
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
earlier draft where there's a section in
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
the 306s that talked about schools being
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
required to identify um gaps that are
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
found in equity and one of the original
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
drafts that changed that to requiring
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
schools to have a plan for addressing
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
underachievement of students what we've
 
02:05:58.030 --> 02:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
done now is we've actually combined
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
those two statements together so that
 
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
schools are both required to identify
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
gaps in equity the original language of
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
the 36 as well as develop a plan for how
 
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
the school intends to address those gaps
 
02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:09.830 align:start position:0%
the school intends to address those gaps
in

02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
equity better than what it
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
was I appreciate the answer but that
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound adequate okay we're going
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
to cut it off right just a point of
 
02:06:18.239 --> 02:06:19.430 align:start position:0%
to cut it off right just a point of
claric

02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
claric
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
when you have the new
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
draft rent cordelan and I were just kind
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
of kits in here a little bit will there
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
be a side by side with the new draft of
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
the new language versus the old language
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
I will talk to our rules folks and see
 
02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
what we can put together thank you I
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't know how long it took you to do
 
02:06:41.069 --> 02:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
that Jen but this 109 or what 20 pages
 
02:06:44.350 --> 02:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
is one heck of a task but I want to
 
02:06:46.189 --> 02:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Fred and both Fred
 
02:06:48.030 --> 02:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
and Nate and all those that came that
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
have been part of of this process uh we
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
look forward to
 
02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
receiving the next update or
 
02:07:01.629 --> 02:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
draft and as with any process there's
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
got to be some accountability to ensure
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of statutory changes here on
 
02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
this committee and it doesn't get done
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
out in the field and there's no Hammer
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
that Doe has to ensure it gets done so
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping we can because this is a
 
02:07:21.310 --> 02:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
direction we got to go
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
in but there's a lot of local control
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
here that's going to be making those
 
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
decisions and uh somehow we got to find
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
that sweet spot as you said
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
earlier yes uh thanks very much uh Rick
 
02:07:39.149 --> 02:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
and and um and thanks again for being
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
here but could we also get from the
 
02:07:44.549 --> 02:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
Department the order of operations um uh
 
02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
for this just to make sure we understand
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
where this committee and where the
 
02:07:50.589 --> 02:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
oversight Commission fits into the um
 
02:07:53.069 --> 02:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
the um um yeah that's part of the
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
process which we'd like to have we spoke
 
02:07:56.669 --> 02:07:56.679 align:start position:0%
of at the very beginning yes right
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
terrific thank you okay thank you very
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%

02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.270 align:start position:0%
much for coming we're going to thank you

much thank you very
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.440 --> 03:18:16.189 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:18:16.189 --> 03:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
the uh Committee of the hold to address
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:30.590 --> 03:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon the first bill which I'd like
 
03:18:33.710 --> 03:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
to take up today would be HB
 
03:18:37.189 --> 03:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
352 this is relative to excused absences
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
due to a student's mental or Behavioral
 
03:18:43.710 --> 03:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
Health we we had a pretty good
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:50.399 --> 03:18:52.830 align:start position:0%
 
met

03:18:52.830 --> 03:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
met
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
and several of the things which we
 
03:18:57.389 --> 03:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
identified without looking at my notes
 
03:18:59.630 --> 03:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
right here is that many of the loow the
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
school districts currently have policies
 
03:19:03.550 --> 03:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
in place dealing with
 
03:19:06.510 --> 03:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
absence they also require that fear out
 
03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
for any kind of an absent that a
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
communication be made with the school by
 
03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
the adult
 
03:19:13.319 --> 03:19:15.030 align:start position:0%
the adult
at

03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
home and if not they'll call
 
03:19:22.349 --> 03:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
you and thirdly we also know that if
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
you're out for a medical reason Beyond
 
03:19:28.349 --> 03:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
five days that you have to come in with
 
03:19:28.359 --> 03:19:29.710 align:start position:0%
five days that you have to come in with
a

03:19:29.710 --> 03:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:19:34.349 --> 03:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
doctor's uh note indicating just what
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
kind of a condition you
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
had and so I'm also
 
03:19:42.550 --> 03:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's room for abuse with this with
 
03:19:44.880 --> 03:19:46.309 align:start position:0%
there's room for abuse with this with
this

03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:19:49.750 --> 03:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that an
 
03:19:52.229 --> 03:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
individual like myself would like to
 
03:19:55.630 --> 03:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
stay up and watch a football game being
 
03:19:59.150 --> 03:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
held between Cal State and Montana or
 
03:20:01.630 --> 03:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
something such as that on the west coast
 
03:20:04.429 --> 03:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
with a different start time and I'm up
 
03:20:06.750 --> 03:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
all night so I'm going to take a mental
 
03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
health the next day to stay
 
03:20:12.590 --> 03:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
home um that doesn't slice it right
 
03:20:15.309 --> 03:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
so I think there's room for abuse and I
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
think when you are absent
 
03:20:20.110 --> 03:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
from with a doctor's certificate yes
 
03:20:22.429 --> 03:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity perhaps we can
 
03:20:24.229 --> 03:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
have some support given you if you need
 
03:20:28.990 --> 03:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
a special plan 50 what 5014
 
03:20:32.189 --> 03:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
504 which is necessary we also want to
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that um when you are absent
 
03:20:37.269 --> 03:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
you something occurs so that we know
 
03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
nothing's happened on the way to school
 
03:20:44.510 --> 03:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
but lastly the the school has to know
 
03:20:46.590 --> 03:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
where you are at all times they
 
03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
should um and the last point I was going
 
03:20:51.189 --> 03:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
to think of
 
03:20:51.199 --> 03:20:54.750 align:start position:0%
to think of
was

03:20:54.750 --> 03:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
the just dropped there's a lot of
 
03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
reasons why I just can't support this
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
bill any follow-up discussion on
 
03:21:06.870 --> 03:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
it are we all on the same
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:21:14.550 --> 03:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
I rick one question I guess not not
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
withstanding uh the abuse that you talk
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
about not withstanding the abuse that
 
03:21:28.269 --> 03:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
Rick talked about my concern would be is
 
03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
that if a
 
03:21:32.590 --> 03:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
student is in
 
03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
fact under the care of a
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
physician and has acknowledged with the
 
03:21:41.349 --> 03:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
school that there this is not an
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
incident kind of a thing this would be
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
either a chronic or um or somebody's
 
03:21:49.830 --> 03:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
under the care and has to be out of
 
03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
school I mean that I would think that
 
03:21:54.389 --> 03:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
I'd want some
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
protection for that not the abuse of
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
issue but I do believe that there are
 
03:21:59.279 --> 03:22:00.349 align:start position:0%
issue but I do believe that there are
some

03:22:00.349 --> 03:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:22:02.349 --> 03:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
students uh who
 
03:22:06.269 --> 03:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
may be under care and um that there
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
ought to be some allowances now whether
 
03:22:10.269 --> 03:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
or not that can already be done in the
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
school district and this is this uh
 
03:22:14.469 --> 03:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is not relevant or
 
03:22:17.189 --> 03:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
needed that's a whole another question
 
03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
but um I don't know I that would be that
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
would be my concern now do you believe
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
that if I'm going to take a mental
 
03:22:28.110 --> 03:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
health day for whatever the reason might
 
03:22:32.229 --> 03:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
be because I'm allowed how many of them
 
03:22:35.790 --> 03:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
five and I get credit for attendance at
 
03:22:38.910 --> 03:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
school for that given day well I know
 
03:22:40.590 --> 03:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
there's a huge test coming up tomorrow
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just not going to go to school I'm
 
03:22:44.110 --> 03:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
taking a mental health
 
03:22:49.269 --> 03:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:51.309 --> 03:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
attendance so you're asking me that
 
03:22:52.990 --> 03:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
question well I'm asking the whole
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee is that you know is that right
 
03:22:57.510 --> 03:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
so Rick
 
03:23:00.189 --> 03:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah you know what one of the one
 
03:23:02.750 --> 03:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the pieces of information we received
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
during the hearing on 352 was that other
 
03:23:07.229 --> 03:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
states looks like at least 12 other
 
03:23:10.030 --> 03:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
states have adopted similar measures and
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you know we should be able to get an
 
03:23:14.110 --> 03:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
to to the question that you just asked
 
03:23:16.590 --> 03:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
um Mel you know with respect to what
 
03:23:19.269 --> 03:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
happens to a student if they um if they
 
03:23:20.990 --> 03:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know take a mental health excused
 
03:23:23.830 --> 03:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
absence on a day of a test and we
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
probably be able to find out from those
 
03:23:28.910 --> 03:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
other states what um what they've seen
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
as far as um as far as you know I don't
 
03:23:34.110 --> 03:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
know what you want to call it unintended
 
03:23:36.429 --> 03:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
consequences uh as a result of students
 
03:23:39.189 --> 03:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
taking those um mental health days um
 
03:23:40.750 --> 03:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think I don't think New
 
03:23:42.790 --> 03:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is necessarily being the
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
area yes represent Hall yes thank you um
 
03:23:52.910 --> 03:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking the whether it's mental
 
03:23:54.670 --> 03:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
health whether it's a flu whether it's
 
03:23:56.269 --> 03:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
whatever the parent writes a note that
 
03:23:59.510 --> 03:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
says my child was out sick period if you
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
get a doctor's note the doctor's not
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to tell you what they have I don't
 
03:24:05.790 --> 03:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
think they shouldn't they should just
 
03:24:09.070 --> 03:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
say you know they cannot attend school
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
for the next two weeks they shouldn't
 
03:24:12.510 --> 03:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
tell them why shouldn't tell them
 
03:24:13.950 --> 03:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
because of mental health or because they
 
03:24:17.950 --> 03:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
got diabetes or whatever it is
 
03:24:21.229 --> 03:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
so I I think what we have in place right
 
03:24:21.239 --> 03:24:25.510 align:start position:0%
so I I think what we have in place right
now

03:24:25.510 --> 03:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:27.790 --> 03:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
works go ahead it's it's it's just a
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or
 
03:24:34.630 --> 03:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
basically okay thanks um I did my
 
03:24:36.870 --> 03:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
homework I called some of the schools in
 
03:24:39.550 --> 03:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
my district and said what happens when a
 
03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
parent says a child's not coming
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's the secretary that
 
03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
takes it sometimes it's the nurse that
 
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
ask the questions but they said we have
 
03:24:51.309 --> 03:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
to ask them uh if they have uh the
 
03:24:53.229 --> 03:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
symptoms because we have to still track
 
03:24:56.150 --> 03:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
flu and coid cases and I said well if
 
03:24:57.950 --> 03:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted a mental health day
 
03:24:59.630 --> 03:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
could they get around that by just
 
03:25:01.510 --> 03:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
saying doesn't have a fever doesn't have
 
03:25:04.550 --> 03:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
flu or coid but is is too sick to come
 
03:25:06.309 --> 03:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
to school and they said that would work
 
03:25:08.429 --> 03:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
that'd be fine I said what if you had
 
03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
special category for mental health days
 
03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
that would be a lot of extra paperwork
 
03:25:14.150 --> 03:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
and it would fall on the secretary or
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
the nurse who didn't really neither
 
03:25:18.229 --> 03:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
which really wanted that um and then
 
03:25:22.110 --> 03:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
they asked uh I said um what happens you
 
03:25:24.150 --> 03:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
know if they mount up and he said well
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
they would just be counted the same way
 
03:25:29.030 --> 03:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
the other ones are if they're three SE
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
once you get to three days or three
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
illnesses in that term then you get
 
03:25:35.309 --> 03:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
kicked to a different level and you get
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
some intervention so they they've got
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
their eyes on it all the time there is a
 
03:25:42.309 --> 03:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
way around it with saying
 
03:25:44.910 --> 03:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to to admit to a
 
03:25:46.630 --> 03:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
mental health day but if somebody needs
 
03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
it and they need an excused absence
 
03:25:50.590 --> 03:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
there's a way to do it without this I
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
think I think it's suurus what they're
 
03:25:53.710 --> 03:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
03:25:56.110 --> 03:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
here who's next represent
 
03:25:58.990 --> 03:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you formal informal thank
 
03:26:01.150 --> 03:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
you chairman lad
 
03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
um my my concerns are twofold uh Rick on
 
03:26:08.189 --> 03:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
the the piece uh as they were before we
 
03:26:10.189 --> 03:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
first discussed it when I was here back
 
03:26:12.510 --> 03:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
in February
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the part that you're talking about
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
about being considered for tenant which
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
is number four in that this uh ELR it's
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
only calculating the average daily
 
03:26:24.150 --> 03:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
attendance it has nothing to do with the
 
03:26:25.429 --> 03:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
youngster being there it's for the
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
school but more than that I go back to
 
03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
item three um which says the youngsters
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
shall not have their grades adversely
 
03:26:35.030 --> 03:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
affected by the lack of class attendant
 
03:26:36.189 --> 03:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
and I know the school districts
 
03:26:38.189 --> 03:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
including where I have uh been in the
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
State uh in two different school
 
03:26:41.950 --> 03:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
districts in New Hampshire that if the
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
youngster is out x amount of days it
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
impacts their academic grade or the
 
03:26:48.590 --> 03:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
ability to make up work so uh if a
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
parent if they youngsters is having a
 
03:26:52.309 --> 03:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
behavioral issue and and I I don't call
 
03:26:55.389 --> 03:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
it in uh then you start to accumulate
 
03:26:56.950 --> 03:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
that data but if I have the opportunity
 
03:26:59.189 --> 03:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
to call like my Johnny's having a
 
03:27:02.590 --> 03:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
problem today Behavior D um then they
 
03:27:04.510 --> 03:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
make the not of that so he has an
 
03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity or she has an opportunity
 
03:27:07.150 --> 03:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
the time comes and the mentally
 
03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
competent feel better to make up the
 
03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
work um so it's it's not like just the
 
03:27:13.750 --> 03:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
youngster saying I'm not going to go
 
03:27:15.790 --> 03:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
today CU I have a test tomorrow they can
 
03:27:18.030 --> 03:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
do that now uh and they whatever the
 
03:27:19.469 --> 03:27:19.479 align:start position:0%
school policy to make up a test they
 
03:27:20.349 --> 03:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
will I mean you're not going to get out
 
03:27:21.870 --> 03:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
of the test but we're talking about
 
03:27:23.950 --> 03:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't become mentally ill or
 
03:27:25.550 --> 03:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
have a behavioral issue just the day of
 
03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
the test unless they Haven to have bu be
 
03:27:30.150 --> 03:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
for exams and we're talking about a real
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
problem and that's a concern I have Rick
 
03:27:34.550 --> 03:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
with three and four um four doesn't
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
impact anything the average daily tenant
 
03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
but three three impacts to me my concern
 
03:27:41.429 --> 03:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
is the youngster uh can be Nega impact
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
but something he have no control of and
 
03:27:45.630 --> 03:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's a poor I I would suggest
 
03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
that that's a poor School District
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
policy but that's the policy most folks
 
03:27:51.150 --> 03:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
have because we don't have this uh
 
03:27:57.030 --> 03:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
caveat to it thank you yeah further
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
discussion reent
 
03:28:02.670 --> 03:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you the current
 
03:28:06.110 --> 03:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
statute uh requires that school boards
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh except uh establish policies related
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
to all this um including a definition of
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
excused absence and a process for
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
considering exceptions to absences not
 
03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
excused um process for Intervention when
 
03:28:26.269 --> 03:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
necessary with individual students um so
 
03:28:29.309 --> 03:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
I I think it's pretty well covered in
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
that um it requires these policies to be
 
03:28:34.110 --> 03:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
in place
 
03:28:38.349 --> 03:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
already they don't go ahead they don't
 
03:28:40.389 --> 03:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
require that these two conditions be
 
03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
included in the Poli
 
03:28:43.469 --> 03:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
it's like it's like setting the
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
standards for curricula they don't tell
 
03:28:47.590 --> 03:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
you what they have to be in place this
 
03:28:49.670 --> 03:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
this says you know what this has to be
 
03:28:52.189 --> 03:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
in the policy that's all it says doesn't
 
03:28:53.269 --> 03:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
tell you how the school's going to deal
 
03:28:54.269 --> 03:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
with it just says this has to be
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
considered the policy that's all and
 
03:28:58.990 --> 03:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
we're not this is not 20 I mean I'm I'm
 
03:29:00.670 --> 03:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
sure the the issues 20 years ago are
 
03:29:02.550 --> 03:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
similar but they seem to have been
 
03:29:04.710 --> 03:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
exacerbated over the last five or six
 
03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
years we have a lot more youngsters who
 
03:29:09.469 --> 03:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
are dealing with significantly more
 
03:29:11.910 --> 03:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
emotional and behavioral issues so I I
 
03:29:13.510 --> 03:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
just think now it's it's it's it just
 
03:29:15.429 --> 03:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
tells the school board folks wake up you
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
have to include these two that's all
 
03:29:19.469 --> 03:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
this says thank you so what's your
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
definition of mental health I have a
 
03:29:23.030 --> 03:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
mental health issue I'm just going to
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
say I didn't come to school today I have
 
03:29:27.389 --> 03:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
mental health issue what could that be
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
or you are you speaking as you or as a
 
03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
parent I mean you you the youngster you
 
03:29:35.070 --> 03:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
a parent either let's say you're the
 
03:29:39.070 --> 03:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
parent of that student okay are you
 
03:29:40.550 --> 03:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
parent of that student calls in you got
 
03:29:42.189 --> 03:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
you got to believe it what's your option
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
you have a question on it I mean if the
 
03:29:45.870 --> 03:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
if they're legitimate they have enough
 
03:29:47.349 --> 03:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
high enough time saying those words to
 
03:29:49.229 --> 03:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
you to a secretary or a nurse or anyone
 
03:29:51.189 --> 03:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
else or teach you Tak tenant it's not
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate not a damn thing you do about
 
03:29:55.550 --> 03:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
it on any absence so if the parent calls
 
03:29:57.910 --> 03:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
in and say my child's not well that's it
 
03:29:59.990 --> 03:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's it yeah why do you have to have a
 
03:30:01.429 --> 03:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
policy then for mental health if they
 
03:30:03.429 --> 03:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
can adding you're adding these two
 
03:30:04.910 --> 03:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
pieces in there because school districts
 
03:30:06.790 --> 03:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
some don't have that and you have the
 
03:30:08.630 --> 03:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
attendance caveat that says you miss x
 
03:30:11.309 --> 03:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
amount of days it STS a negative impact
 
03:30:14.830 --> 03:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
grade that's all representative
 
03:30:16.910 --> 03:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and just to
 
03:30:18.429 --> 03:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
follow up on some of that the way that I
 
03:30:20.269 --> 03:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
see this particular policy being written
 
03:30:23.189 --> 03:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
is first of all right away I don't think
 
03:30:24.910 --> 03:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
any of us dispute the fact that
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes a mental health day might be
 
03:30:29.070 --> 03:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
necessary for a student
 
03:30:31.229 --> 03:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
um however currently I don't see
 
03:30:32.750 --> 03:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
anything first of all in law that would
 
03:30:34.189 --> 03:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
prevent them from taking a mental health
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
day they can do that um second what this
 
03:30:40.469 --> 03:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
seems to do by by calling out mental
 
03:30:41.950 --> 03:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
health specific speically as opposed to
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
physical health it seems to be setting
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
up a discriminatory system where
 
03:30:46.990 --> 03:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
somebody with mental health is going to
 
03:30:48.349 --> 03:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
be treated differently than somebody
 
03:30:51.269 --> 03:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
with a physical element where somebody
 
03:30:53.309 --> 03:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
who might need to be out sick for an
 
03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
extended time because of long Co or
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
whatever is going to be treated
 
03:30:57.750 --> 03:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
differently from somebody with a mental
 
03:31:00.030 --> 03:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
health issue they would be failed
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
because they missed more than five days
 
03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
whereas somebody with a mental health
 
03:31:04.750 --> 03:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
issue would not be and that seems like a
 
03:31:07.189 --> 03:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
problem if this if this is necessary to
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
be addressed it seems like this needs to
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
be broadened in scope to include um
 
03:31:15.309 --> 03:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
physical elements not just mental and
 
03:31:18.269 --> 03:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
then we could have to debate on
 
03:31:18.279 --> 03:31:19.990 align:start position:0%
then we could have to debate on
that

03:31:19.990 --> 03:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:22.830 --> 03:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I hate I hate to do this but could
 
03:31:25.710 --> 03:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
we uh ask our retired
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent on the committee on
 
03:31:39.670 --> 03:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
this oh did have to deal with it number
 
03:31:42.399 --> 03:31:44.110 align:start position:0%
this oh did have to deal with it number
one

03:31:44.110 --> 03:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I think we had a discussion about
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
this already once and I was not in
 
03:31:51.670 --> 03:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
support of this bill because I think
 
03:31:56.229 --> 03:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
there are mechanisms in place to excuse
 
03:31:58.990 --> 03:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
families that are struggling with a
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
student in with a mental health crisis
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
and or a behavioral crisis and nine
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
times out of
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
10 the school administration School
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
nurse whatever has worked with a parent
 
03:32:18.030 --> 03:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
and knows that there's a diagnosed
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
issue if you've got a student that say
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
has behavioral issues because they've
 
03:32:28.269 --> 03:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
experienced posttraumatic stress
 
03:32:31.550 --> 03:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
disorder someone in that school will
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully know that because if that
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
child goes beyond the 5 days of absence
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully there is a 504 plan to make
 
03:32:45.070 --> 03:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
accommodations for that or if it's so
 
03:32:46.830 --> 03:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
severe that they have to miss a lot that
 
03:32:49.670 --> 03:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's an IEP with an identification of
 
03:32:50.830 --> 03:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
other health
 
03:32:53.550 --> 03:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
impaired so there I think there are
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place to make sure that
 
03:32:59.389 --> 03:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
those kids and that parent that calls
 
03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
and says okay today's a day that they
 
03:33:05.750 --> 03:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
have to be out the school will also
 
03:33:05.760 --> 03:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
have to be out the school will also
already

03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:33:09.790 --> 03:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
know that it's part of their mental
 
03:33:15.150 --> 03:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:21.510 --> 03:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
one so we're not going to we can't you
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
know we don't we're not all here right
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
now and but we can take a straw vote we
 
03:33:27.229 --> 03:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
could take a
 
03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
vote but um how many people at this
 
03:33:32.910 --> 03:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
point in time saying this bill is
 
03:33:35.710 --> 03:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
already taken care of through policy and
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
procedures in the school so it's not
 
03:33:40.269 --> 03:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
needed how many people are on that page
 
03:33:43.150 --> 03:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.070 --> 03:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
so who's counting
 
03:33:49.510 --> 03:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:55.309 --> 03:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
three s eight 10 11 you got 12 I got 11
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
now so I think we have a majority there
 
03:34:01.269 --> 03:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
saying that I don't think anybody's
 
03:34:01.279 --> 03:34:03.189 align:start position:0%
saying that I don't think anybody's
saying

03:34:03.189 --> 03:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
that we we don't want to deal with the
 
03:34:07.950 --> 03:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
issue mental health but I think at this
 
03:34:10.830 --> 03:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
point in time we have a process we're
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
is complicate that process and and I've
 
03:34:18.429 --> 03:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
had that happen in the schools I've had
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
in fact I had a nurse back up north name
 
03:34:23.790 --> 03:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
was Mary Bell and Mary was on top of
 
03:34:25.309 --> 03:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
everything that was going on with the
 
03:34:27.630 --> 03:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
families especially those families were
 
03:34:29.790 --> 03:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
maybe going through a divorce or there
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
had been some kind of abuse in the
 
03:34:33.910 --> 03:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
family and we
 
03:34:36.590 --> 03:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
understood and and so I think that
 
03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's that awareness but I also
 
03:34:41.389 --> 03:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
03:34:43.349 --> 03:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
there's ways that a parent could call in
 
03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
and say my child isn't well today that's
 
03:34:48.990 --> 03:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
it now if that happens five consecutive
 
03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
days then we start asking what's going
 
03:34:55.150 --> 03:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
on get a doctor's note saying what the
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
medical issue
 
03:35:00.309 --> 03:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
is so um
 
03:35:03.710 --> 03:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
I I'm good with uh you know moving on
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
Beyond this bill and and uh we're going
 
03:35:08.349 --> 03:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
to have a lot of bills like that this
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
year and we're going to have to start
 
03:35:12.269 --> 03:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
deciding now is it already occurring
 
03:35:14.070 --> 03:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
through policy in the schools if it is
 
03:35:15.950 --> 03:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
let's move
 
03:35:19.070 --> 03:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
on yes represent cascaden um just want
 
03:35:21.070 --> 03:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
to add that it's really critical for the
 
03:35:22.950 --> 03:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
parent to have a relationship with the
 
03:35:25.710 --> 03:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
school because see the school is
 
03:35:29.110 --> 03:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
resourceful and if the parent isn't
 
03:35:30.990 --> 03:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
needs resources the school should be
 
03:35:32.189 --> 03:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:35:35.070 --> 03:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
offer what resources they have or where
 
03:35:37.670 --> 03:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
the parent can find resources yeah so
 
03:35:39.429 --> 03:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
there has to be that communication
 
03:35:41.189 --> 03:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
03:35:43.990 --> 03:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
because you want to support kids in all
 
03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:45.550 align:start position:0%
because you want to support kids in all
their

03:35:45.550 --> 03:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:35:45.560 --> 03:35:47.630 align:start position:0%
their
capacities

03:35:47.630 --> 03:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
capacities
 
03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay Al righty so let's go on to the
 
03:35:52.750 --> 03:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
next bill then so with that we'll
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
probably have a motion come forward
 
03:35:57.189 --> 03:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
during the November 13th meeting to itl
 
03:35:59.830 --> 03:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
that bill and we'll write the blur in
 
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.750 --> 03:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
why okay the next bill we have two other
 
03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.630 --> 03:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:24.630 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:27.630 --> 03:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
yeah we have one that's modifying
 
03:36:27.640 --> 03:36:31.229 align:start position:0%
yeah we have one that's modifying
193

03:36:31.229 --> 03:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
e well I'm trying to find my sheet I
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:48.550 --> 03:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes and it and it does have bipar it's
 
03:36:50.750 --> 03:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's if you look at
 
03:36:54.189 --> 03:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
it the majority people signing on were
 
03:36:57.070 --> 03:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
senators and then there's four
 
03:37:00.750 --> 03:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
reps which represented Cornell was one
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so and there was bip Parson part and
 
03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.399 --> 03:37:16.269 align:start position:0%
 
senators

03:37:16.269 --> 03:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'll just lead off with what
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
my concern would
 
03:37:21.760 --> 03:37:23.790 align:start position:0%
my concern would
be

03:37:23.790 --> 03:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
that we have academic standards and we
 
03:37:29.950 --> 03:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
presented them in the last time the
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
packets are from
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
2003 where there's health education
 
03:37:38.910 --> 03:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
taught at elementary middle and high
 
03:37:42.229 --> 03:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
schools within each of those levels
 
03:37:45.630 --> 03:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
there's a component for mental
 
03:37:48.349 --> 03:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
health so that means these have been
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
approved by the State Board of
 
03:37:53.070 --> 03:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
Education we also had the question asked
 
03:37:56.910 --> 03:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
today of the 306 people are you taking
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
out the elements within
 
03:38:03.670 --> 03:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
30640 Health he said no that's remaining
 
03:38:07.950 --> 03:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
in that keeps mental health then in the
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
rule making process which is an approved
 
03:38:13.070 --> 03:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
by Jael car which is the joint
 
03:38:15.550 --> 03:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
legislative committee administrative
 
03:38:20.269 --> 03:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
rules so it is a part of our curriculum
 
03:38:23.550 --> 03:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
it is a part of the rule making already
 
03:38:25.710 --> 03:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
do we need it as
 
03:38:28.990 --> 03:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
a and it is a subtopic of Health where
 
03:38:32.189 --> 03:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
health and wellness are already in the
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
adequacy part of
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
193e are we going to start adding in all
 
03:38:39.510 --> 03:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
the other components of Health
 
03:38:41.910 --> 03:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
inadequacy nutrition
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
physiology substance abuse
 
03:38:47.389 --> 03:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
alcoholism underneath adequacy or is
 
03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
just the topic health and
 
03:38:51.710 --> 03:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
wellness Incorporated according to the
 
03:38:53.790 --> 03:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
state board it
 
03:38:58.349 --> 03:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
does so I see it's not
 
03:39:02.070 --> 03:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
needed in this section of
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy I'm talking about 151 which is
 
03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:22.349 --> 03:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
bill so you're you're concerned that
 
03:39:22.359 --> 03:39:24.590 align:start position:0%
bill so you're you're concerned that
they

03:39:24.590 --> 03:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
they luminating specific topics that
 
03:39:30.349 --> 03:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
would be already covered by the topic
 
03:39:32.309 --> 03:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
health or perhaps covering the General
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
Public Health by local ccul not perhaps
 
03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
the curriculum guidelines specify it
 
03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
shall be taught oh hell not these
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
subject me mental health is within the
 
03:39:46.670 --> 03:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
framework I think uh represent cascaden
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
just waved it to you
 
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so all of
 
03:39:55.680 --> 03:39:57.670 align:start position:0%
yeah so all of
the

03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:40:00.750 --> 03:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
um examples that you just cited
 
03:40:03.550 --> 03:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
nutrition physiology substance abuse
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
Etc all fall either Under the Umbrella
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
of physical health or mental health so I
 
03:40:11.670 --> 03:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
don't think that the possibility of
 
03:40:15.389 --> 03:40:15.399 align:start position:0%
putting mental health as a curriculum
 
03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
requirement opens a door to
 
03:40:20.590 --> 03:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
listing you know a myriad of other
 
03:40:23.389 --> 03:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
conditions because there's really two
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
categories of Health there's physical
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
health and mental health and everything
 
03:40:31.550 --> 03:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
falls under one of those if we only say
 
03:40:34.189 --> 03:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
health conventionally the word health is
 
03:40:36.269 --> 03:40:36.279 align:start position:0%
understood to mean physical health it's
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
not routinely
 
03:40:41.630 --> 03:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
utilized as the broad umbrella of all
 
03:40:44.110 --> 03:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
Health including mental health I wish it
 
03:40:48.750 --> 03:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
were but it's not and so look at 306 I
 
03:40:52.670 --> 03:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
specify mental health it specifies it in
 
03:40:54.990 --> 03:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
30640 but that's different from putting
 
03:40:57.790 --> 03:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
it in statute these have been approved
 
03:41:00.590 --> 03:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.910 --> 03:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and I guess I'm not as
 
03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
confident as you are that the answer
 
03:41:08.510 --> 03:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
this morning is the outcome that we will
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
have in those revie
 
03:41:13.710 --> 03:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
ISS and I think it's critically
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
important that students
 
03:41:17.630 --> 03:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
learn the
 
03:41:21.150 --> 03:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
basics of mental health risk factors
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
protective factors common concerns then
 
03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
my response to that would be and I think
 
03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
I mentioned at the last meeting if in
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.149 --> 03:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
30640 I wouldn't put mental health here
 
03:41:38.389 --> 03:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
underneath adequacy I'd stick it in
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
where we've stuck in other issues
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with health under studies which
 
03:41:47.469 --> 03:41:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.950 --> 03:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
bill clarify what you mean by the next
 
03:41:51.950 --> 03:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
bill Oh you mean the we have three bills
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
the 505 one the other mental health Bill
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have not yet discussed sorry where we
 
03:41:59.590 --> 03:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
put in physical education we put in HIV
 
03:42:02.349 --> 03:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
we put in all the other topics which
 
03:42:05.309 --> 03:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
come underneath health I put it there
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
rather than adding in another area under
 
03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:10.670 align:start position:0%
rather than adding in another area under
adequacy

03:42:10.670 --> 03:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
03:42:12.429 --> 03:42:12.439 align:start position:0%
which is you
 
03:42:14.670 --> 03:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
know it's already there underneath the
 
03:42:14.680 --> 03:42:15.990 align:start position:0%
know it's already there underneath the
topic

03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
topic
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
Health if we're going to put social
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
studies down there our history down
 
03:42:22.110 --> 03:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
there are we going to start then putting
 
03:42:25.590 --> 03:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
down the Civil War the Depression era
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
what happened in the 70s and 60s civil
 
03:42:31.710 --> 03:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
rights or are that is that already there
 
03:42:33.790 --> 03:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
underneath the curriculum Frameworks I
 
03:42:36.189 --> 03:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
think we' got to be very careful how far
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
we go with putting things into
 
03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:41.990 align:start position:0%
we go with putting things into
adequacy

03:42:41.990 --> 03:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair so you know we we
 
03:42:48.189 --> 03:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
actually took up um similar discussions
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
in the Commerce Committee when it came
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
to health insurance U and uh and mental
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
health parity and and uh and as as um
 
03:42:59.710 --> 03:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
hope was saying typically you know
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
health is is is is read and understood
 
03:43:06.550 --> 03:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
to mean physical health and so it was
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
very important in a lot of the insurance
 
03:43:11.710 --> 03:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
RS to spell out mental health as being
 
03:43:15.149 --> 03:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
as being part of what is meant by Health
 
03:43:18.469 --> 03:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
um and and I I agree I mean I think the
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
the department has um has over the years
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
done a done a good job to make sure that
 
03:43:26.670 --> 03:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh that it included mental health in the
 
03:43:28.950 --> 03:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
definition of Health but if that's not
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
required Then That Could That Could
 
03:43:37.469 --> 03:43:37.479 align:start position:0%
disappear um and um so so I I mean I I
 
03:43:40.429 --> 03:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying on on this this
 
03:43:43.469 --> 03:43:43.479 align:start position:0%
I I think maybe it's it's um it's not
 
03:43:45.149 --> 03:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
needed based on what the Department's
 
03:43:47.710 --> 03:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
done so far but it doesn't mean that the
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
department will continue to do that um
 
03:43:54.550 --> 03:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
in the future and uh um uh on the o on
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
the other hand though Mr chair maybe the
 
03:44:00.189 --> 03:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
definition of of Health particularly as
 
03:44:03.189 --> 03:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
it relates to our insurance laws not as
 
03:44:05.950 --> 03:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
it includes mental health maybe we can
 
03:44:09.149 --> 03:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
lean on that um as saying look the
 
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
modern definition of Health includes
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
mental health and maybe you're right
 
03:44:17.550 --> 03:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe this isn't necessary um now
 
03:44:21.630 --> 03:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
that we're in 2023 if you look at
 
03:44:25.469 --> 03:44:25.479 align:start position:0%
18910 where it says studies Roman 2 it
 
03:44:27.510 --> 03:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
says the school board shall ensure that
 
03:44:27.520 --> 03:44:28.469 align:start position:0%
says the school board shall ensure that
health

03:44:28.469 --> 03:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:44:31.229 --> 03:44:31.239 align:start position:0%
education physical education to include
 
03:44:33.389 --> 03:44:33.399 align:start position:0%
the importance of exercise and wellness
 
03:44:35.149 --> 03:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
are taught to pupils as part of the
 
03:44:37.950 --> 03:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum specifically to include
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
physiology hygiene health health and
 
03:44:41.790 --> 03:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
interpersonal relationships physical
 
03:44:44.229 --> 03:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
education and wellness as they relate to
 
03:44:47.309 --> 03:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
the effects of school Alcohol and Other
 
03:44:49.389 --> 03:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
Drugs prevention of sexual violence
 
03:44:52.149 --> 03:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
child abuses there's a whole Litany of
 
03:44:54.030 --> 03:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
areas there we're talking about it's
 
03:44:56.670 --> 03:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
easy to immerse if we have to mental
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
health right into that area under
 
03:45:01.710 --> 03:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
studies so it will say that the local
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard shall ensure that that is
 
03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:07.670 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard shall ensure that that is
taught

03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
um isn't that what the next
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the next the next
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Health I I don't like the
 
03:45:17.189 --> 03:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
word comprehensive at all but I have no
 
03:45:20.269 --> 03:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
objections to mental health being
 
03:45:23.469 --> 03:45:23.479 align:start position:0%
inserted but not underneath
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
um adequacy
 
03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
1938 for a lot of reasons yeah fair
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
enough and I think I think you're right
 
03:45:35.910 --> 03:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
under studies it certainly um uh if it
 
03:45:38.349 --> 03:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
were if it were put there it would uh it
 
03:45:40.349 --> 03:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
would make it clear that that mental
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
Health Rick I think
 
03:45:49.710 --> 03:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
also as you queried this
 
03:45:51.790 --> 03:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
morning we don't know what's going to be
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
in the standards that's right so my
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
sense is why don't we wait and see
 
03:45:57.750 --> 03:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what well that's I was hoping to
 
03:46:00.910 --> 03:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
get after yeah sure yeah yeah yeah it's
 
03:46:03.269 --> 03:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
coming out we
 
03:46:05.389 --> 03:46:05.399 align:start position:0%
yeah they said they were going to take
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
these to the State Board in what
 
03:46:11.429 --> 03:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
November November 9 9th meet we meet the
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
13th yeah it's really tight yeah if they
 
03:46:18.630 --> 03:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
meet when they say they're going to meet
 
03:46:18.640 --> 03:46:20.750 align:start position:0%
meet when they say they're going to meet
right

03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:46:23.950 --> 03:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
yeah but I agree I want to know for sure
 
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be in rules or not
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
if it's in rules I feel very comfortable
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
where we are because we also have it in
 
03:46:34.189 --> 03:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
the curriculum framework
 
03:46:34.199 --> 03:46:37.910 align:start position:0%
the curriculum framework
yeah

03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:41.429 --> 03:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
y but if we're going to do something I'd
 
03:46:43.870 --> 03:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
rather do something and put it where it
 
03:46:46.269 --> 03:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
belongs just like we did with personal
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
finance literacy we also said that that
 
03:46:51.990 --> 03:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
could be embedded into a course so it's
 
03:46:57.550 --> 03:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:57.560 --> 03:46:59.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:04.070 --> 03:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:07.349 --> 03:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
this Mr chair
 
03:47:10.830 --> 03:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
yes so I appreciate your explanation and
 
03:47:13.950 --> 03:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
the contrast between adequacy putting it
 
03:47:16.269 --> 03:47:16.279 align:start position:0%
into adequacy versus
 
03:47:21.389 --> 03:47:21.399 align:start position:0%
studies so if 505 which places mental
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
health in
 
03:47:28.110 --> 03:47:28.120 align:start position:0%
studies were ought to pass I would be
 
03:47:33.910 --> 03:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable with um a no on
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
151 you're doing that on premise that
 
03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
may we modify Roman 2 and
 
03:47:41.630 --> 03:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
18910 and say the something the health
 
03:47:44.790 --> 03:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
education to include mental health
 
03:47:46.830 --> 03:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
physical education you know I said you
 
03:47:49.269 --> 03:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
know we can work it in there somehow yes
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
and put it in the proper location this
 
03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
is where Anthony was advising us to put
 
03:47:56.590 --> 03:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of this stuff if it's not in rule
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
if it's not a framework where you have
 
03:48:01.189 --> 03:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
an academic standard do not add any more
 
03:48:04.389 --> 03:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
stuff into the adequacy part of the law
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
here and is now gone to California
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:20.149 --> 03:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
calculus is that a strategy that we
 
03:48:21.229 --> 03:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
could play
 
03:48:21.239 --> 03:48:22.750 align:start position:0%
could play
with

03:48:22.750 --> 03:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
here so I think if we're going to have
 
03:48:28.429 --> 03:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
that strategy then the only thing I
 
03:48:30.349 --> 03:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
would change in the latter Bill the one
 
03:48:32.309 --> 03:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
we haven't I'd take the word
 
03:48:32.319 --> 03:48:35.149 align:start position:0%
we haven't I'd take the word
comprehensive

03:48:35.149 --> 03:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
out and just the words that they'll help
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
help and insert that in studies not
 
03:48:46.710 --> 03:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
where's that now Glen in what chapter
 
03:48:50.590 --> 03:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
law it's in 18910 yeah two moment two
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's in the right
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
place yeah represent cascaden um yeah
 
03:48:58.309 --> 03:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
definitely I agree my my problem with
 
03:49:00.910 --> 03:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
that 504 was the word comprehensive
 
03:49:02.910 --> 03:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
because what does it mean so if that
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
word came out of this this bill does
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
that mean that the
 
03:49:12.269 --> 03:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
current framework curriculum would still
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
work yeah yeah okay even if it's 20
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
years old great I know it needs to be
 
03:49:20.349 --> 03:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
Rewritten but I mean schools have had to
 
03:49:22.870 --> 03:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
focus a lot more on Mental Health these
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
last 5 10 years okay even more so
 
03:49:31.349 --> 03:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
now so I guess if we're good with this
 
03:49:34.189 --> 03:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
strategy we've done our
 
03:49:36.309 --> 03:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
homework so we need to bring forward an
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
amendment to just take out the word
 
03:49:38.319 --> 03:49:40.550 align:start position:0%
amendment to just take out the word
comprehensive

03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
03:49:42.510 --> 03:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and we're we're also going to
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
determine what the state board is doing
 
03:49:50.349 --> 03:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
on the 9th was it on the
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
9th hopefully they keep mental health in
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
306 and all the other components of
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:05.550 --> 03:50:05.560 align:start position:0%
they but I also heard conflicting
 
03:50:08.590 --> 03:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
comments from some people participating
 
03:50:11.309 --> 03:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
that are meeting tomorrow with them that
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
there's one area where this person
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
saying all the elements in science have
 
03:50:16.800 --> 03:50:17.590 align:start position:0%
saying all the elements in science have
been

03:50:17.590 --> 03:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:50:20.189 --> 03:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
stripped however that's not what I was
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
told by Dr Green or by Fred they're
 
03:50:25.349 --> 03:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
saying it's going to be in so it's I
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
03:50:30.990 --> 03:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
more a rumor right so Rick along those
 
03:50:33.070 --> 03:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
task force issues yeah that's not our
 
03:50:35.110 --> 03:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
problem so so along those lines do we
 
03:50:38.070 --> 03:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
want to um um what what do you think
 
03:50:40.590 --> 03:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
about scheduling a um
 
03:50:43.630 --> 03:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
meeting for after the board receives the
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
um rules yeah I think we'll have to do
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we should do that though when we
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
can get a copy of what they're
 
03:50:58.110 --> 03:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
presenting whether they're sending a
 
03:51:00.750 --> 03:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
package with the draft as we've seen it
 
03:51:02.550 --> 03:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then all the hearing stuff setting
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
aside that's not what I want to see I
 
03:51:06.670 --> 03:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
want to see this
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
merged or at least acted upon if want it
 
03:51:12.269 --> 03:51:12.279 align:start position:0%
fine if they don't they don't but I'd
 
03:51:14.590 --> 03:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
like to see that final report going to
 
03:51:14.600 --> 03:51:16.670 align:start position:0%
like to see that final report going to
the

03:51:16.670 --> 03:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
board and for us to
 
03:51:22.469 --> 03:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
schedule then a oversight committee but
 
03:51:23.590 --> 03:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do it quickly
 
03:51:25.389 --> 03:51:25.399 align:start position:0%
because that November is coming on as
 
03:51:27.870 --> 03:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
fast right right well the the 10th would
 
03:51:29.790 --> 03:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
be the first date that yeah could even
 
03:51:32.349 --> 03:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
be possible to do that we should know
 
03:51:34.189 --> 03:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
probably the week before whether it's on
 
03:51:37.469 --> 03:51:37.479 align:start position:0%
the agenda for theard right but but you
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
also I mean the report goes to the board
 
03:51:43.229 --> 03:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
we'll have what that final report is but
 
03:51:45.030 --> 03:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
the board may also make some changes in
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.990 --> 03:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
so given what representative Miler just
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
said and the timelines for the
 
03:51:59.149 --> 03:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
legislative retain
 
03:52:02.910 --> 03:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
bills I would vigorously support an OTP
 
03:52:05.550 --> 03:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
on 505 without the word
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive regardless of what happens
 
03:52:11.110 --> 03:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
this fall with the 306 because we're not
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
going to know the final outcome of that
 
03:52:14.910 --> 03:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
before we need to vote on this we can
 
03:52:17.309 --> 03:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
have an amendment made doing what you
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
saying but we're not going to act on
 
03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
that till the
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
13th when we should know a little bit
 
03:52:26.469 --> 03:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
more if we don't know we can go ahead
 
03:52:27.750 --> 03:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
and move that
 
03:52:30.990 --> 03:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment we'll know more but we won't
 
03:52:33.790 --> 03:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
it won't be final well it could still
 
03:52:33.800 --> 03:52:35.070 align:start position:0%
it won't be final well it could still
get

03:52:35.070 --> 03:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:52:35.080 --> 03:52:38.030 align:start position:0%
get
modified

03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
modified
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:42.950 align:start position:0%
modified
well

03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.269 --> 03:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know well we be in any event
 
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
we'd be ready for the 13th and we're
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
just 1 the 13th if we don't know we
 
03:52:51.550 --> 03:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
could move forward with it that's
 
03:52:57.309 --> 03:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
all um but we should know we should
 
03:52:59.710 --> 03:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
know because we have to have our reports
 
03:53:03.630 --> 03:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
out that week of the 13th and 13th is a
 
03:53:06.710 --> 03:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
Monday so they're meeting on the 9th
 
03:53:10.149 --> 03:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
which is Thursday
 
03:53:13.469 --> 03:53:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
there any further comments about that
 
03:53:19.269 --> 03:53:19.279 align:start position:0%
because it's not even 2 o'clock we can
 
03:53:20.469 --> 03:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
get home by
 
03:53:20.479 --> 03:53:22.469 align:start position:0%
get home by
3:30

03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
3:30
 
03:53:25.469 --> 03:53:25.479 align:start position:0%
so so Rick Rick with with with respect
 
03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
to rules which all of this seems to be
 
03:53:33.269 --> 03:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
you know related to uh to the 306s um
 
03:53:33.279 --> 03:53:34.189 align:start position:0%
you know related to uh to the 306s um
does

03:53:34.189 --> 03:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
it are are the rules I mean the rules
 
03:53:39.710 --> 03:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
have to come to the over s it committee
 
03:53:42.030 --> 03:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
for recommend review and recommendation
 
03:53:44.429 --> 03:53:44.439 align:start position:0%
do they also have to go to the
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
legislative to the legisl to the general
 
03:53:50.710 --> 03:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
court for approval prior to going to JL
 
03:53:53.469 --> 03:53:53.479 align:start position:0%
car that's something that you read it
 
03:53:55.110 --> 03:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
this morning or somebody read that was
 
03:53:58.189 --> 03:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's very poorly written
 
03:54:00.309 --> 03:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
law it is very poorly that's right but
 
03:54:02.510 --> 03:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
it looks to me that that that the
 
03:54:06.750 --> 03:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
statute does not call out JL car and 541
 
03:54:08.950 --> 03:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
rulemaking for that but that it has to
 
03:54:11.630 --> 03:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
go to the general court for approve any
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
modifications to the minimum standards
 
03:54:19.389 --> 03:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
after this the date of the you know 193
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:27.510 --> 03:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
court that's why I introduced an LSR
 
03:54:30.389 --> 03:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
which is both saying that the academic
 
03:54:32.590 --> 03:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
standards and the minimum standards for
 
03:54:35.870 --> 03:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
public school approval must go by uh the
 
03:54:38.469 --> 03:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
oversight committee yeah and and then
 
03:54:40.030 --> 03:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:54:43.550 --> 03:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
e2a Roman 4A says changes made by the
 
03:54:45.149 --> 03:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
Board of Education to the school
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
approval standards through Ru making
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
after the effective date of the section
 
03:54:53.950 --> 03:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
so law shall not be included within the
 
03:54:54.990 --> 03:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
standards that constitute the
 
03:54:56.149 --> 03:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to deliver an adequate
 
03:54:58.110 --> 03:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
Education Without prior adoption by the
 
03:54:58.120 --> 03:54:59.670 align:start position:0%
Education Without prior adoption by the
general

03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:55:02.590 --> 03:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
court the standards for an adequate
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
education which is part of it is that
 
03:55:06.670 --> 03:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for public school
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
approval it says changes made by the
 
03:55:12.429 --> 03:55:12.439 align:start position:0%
to the school approval standards through
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
Ru making yeah keep after the effective
 
03:55:18.189 --> 03:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
date of this section yeah shall not be
 
03:55:20.830 --> 03:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
included within the standards that
 
03:55:22.550 --> 03:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
constitute the opportunity for the
 
03:55:24.630 --> 03:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
delivery of an adequate Education
 
03:55:28.389 --> 03:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
Without prior adoption by the general
 
03:55:30.510 --> 03:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
court that's kind of
 
03:55:34.590 --> 03:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
confuted blah blah blah yeah but but but
 
03:55:37.269 --> 03:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
it also May May mean that that when the
 
03:55:40.630 --> 03:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
when the legislature adopted 193 e2a
 
03:55:42.750 --> 03:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
that they were taking its role in terms
 
03:55:44.469 --> 03:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
of delivering a constitutionally
 
03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education very
 
03:55:49.590 --> 03:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
seriously well well my concern was based
 
03:55:52.750 --> 03:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
upon Dr Green's comment this morning
 
03:55:54.630 --> 03:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
when he said H their attorneys are
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
looking at this yeah the qu the question
 
03:56:02.429 --> 03:56:02.439 align:start position:0%
I would have is should we get the AG's
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
office for example involved in just
 
03:56:08.229 --> 03:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
giving us an advisory opinion on their
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
what they they view this particular
 
03:56:13.149 --> 03:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting for the Department
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:20.910 --> 03:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
is as chair we we do have legal advice
 
03:56:23.790 --> 03:56:23.800 align:start position:0%
to this committee okay which we can get
 
03:56:27.070 --> 03:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
from Jim C upstairs house council is
 
03:56:28.790 --> 03:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
where we ought to go let's let's seek
 
03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
that out let's get their opinion on we
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't we don't know we don't know what
 
03:56:34.349 --> 03:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
the Department's going to say but we
 
03:56:36.429 --> 03:56:36.439 align:start position:0%
need at least from from the house
 
03:56:37.870 --> 03:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint we know what the Department's
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
well we can do it yeah that's what I say
 
03:56:45.630 --> 03:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
yeah but it's better to get it clear now
 
03:56:48.269 --> 03:56:48.279 align:start position:0%
rather than having to have that fight
 
03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
later well they you know although I
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
think this might be more than a house
 
03:56:55.550 --> 03:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
counsel question this is a um a question
 
03:56:57.630 --> 03:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
of law not a question of what the house
 
03:57:01.269 --> 03:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
can do or not do and and I it probably
 
03:57:03.389 --> 03:57:03.399 align:start position:0%
resides at the department question is
 
03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
that they have the authority the state
 
03:57:08.910 --> 03:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
board has authority to adopt the
 
03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
standard of public school approval
 
03:57:13.389 --> 03:57:13.399 align:start position:0%
that's in law separate section yep right
 
03:57:15.750 --> 03:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
right at the to now to do that does the
 
03:57:19.070 --> 03:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
process involve approval from
 
03:57:22.149 --> 03:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
us from the legislative
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
oversight and then from the general
 
03:57:28.229 --> 03:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
court Hope Has a you see hope has a
 
03:57:30.269 --> 03:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
question but if it was the General Court
 
03:57:33.070 --> 03:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
approving it it becomes law right and
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
there's no need for them to be adopted
 
03:57:39.790 --> 03:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
by the state board what it says so
 
03:57:42.349 --> 03:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
you ni to have a ruling
 
03:57:46.110 --> 03:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
yeah from home I think it's
 
03:57:48.550 --> 03:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
doj I would start with House Council I
 
03:57:50.309 --> 03:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
think we got start with with our own
 
03:57:52.750 --> 03:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
Council which I can get a you know
 
03:57:55.950 --> 03:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
something back there very quickly within
 
03:57:55.960 --> 03:57:58.189 align:start position:0%
something back there very quickly within
24

03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
24
 
03:58:01.510 --> 03:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
hours KCK up well if it does it does but
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
at least we have gone our route the
 
03:58:05.229 --> 03:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
people are working and assigned to
 
03:58:07.630 --> 03:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
directly work with us I I I think Rick
 
03:58:10.590 --> 03:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
is correct I think uh the house needs to
 
03:58:12.550 --> 03:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
have a position on what this is all
 
03:58:14.469 --> 03:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
right if the department then comes up
 
03:58:16.389 --> 03:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
with an alternative that's when you go
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
to the doj to try to get some clarity on
 
03:58:21.229 --> 03:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
that but I I think you're correct direct
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
start with the how house councel get a
 
03:58:25.149 --> 03:58:25.159 align:start position:0%
clarification then we'll see where it
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
goes from there I think you're right
 
03:58:31.630 --> 03:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I think right as well to do it to
 
03:58:35.670 --> 03:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
preempt it not after the know before
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
there our
 
03:58:37.520 --> 03:58:39.550 align:start position:0%
there our
house

03:58:39.550 --> 03:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
represent Cas um just something I want
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
others to kind of put their antennas out
 
03:58:47.710 --> 03:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
too because my perception on the first
 
03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
draft that I've gone through on the
 
03:58:51.269 --> 03:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
minimum standards is that the word
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
School approval has been removed
 
03:58:56.790 --> 03:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
multiple times and it makes me a little
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
nervous to think are we doing minimum
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
standards to align to the adequacy so
 
03:59:05.309 --> 03:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
that the language is the same in
 
03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
both or are we maintaining minimum
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
standard for public school approval or
 
03:59:10.800 --> 03:59:12.070 align:start position:0%
standard for public school approval or
School

03:59:12.070 --> 03:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
School
 
03:59:14.110 --> 03:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
approval and that made me a little
 
03:59:16.830 --> 03:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
nervous if we dropped a school approval
 
03:59:19.149 --> 03:59:19.159 align:start position:0%
process so just I don't know if it's
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
just my perception going through those
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
drafts but I wanted to voice it so
 
03:59:27.429 --> 03:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
people would kind of say no I mean it's
 
03:59:29.670 --> 03:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
very important that all schools have a
 
03:59:32.590 --> 03:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
minimum standard to follow I mean like
 
03:59:34.110 --> 03:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
Fred said this morning you know how do
 
03:59:36.429 --> 03:59:36.439 align:start position:0%
we know what they've had well if they're
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
all approved schools you know what
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
they've had they've all mastered well
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
proficient whatever you want to use
 
03:59:44.349 --> 03:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
they've all followed the minimum
 
03:59:47.149 --> 03:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
standards for school approval and I'm
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
afraid of that school approval process
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
being dropped but that's just
 
03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
my feeling and I wanted other people I
 
03:59:58.590 --> 03:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'm on the same page you are seriously
 
04:00:03.030 --> 04:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
yes but I but I have a I have a
 
04:00:07.990 --> 04:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
concern that the have you ever seen a
 
04:00:10.070 --> 04:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
report rep as superintendent you should
 
04:00:13.710 --> 04:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
have on the visitation that comes to
 
04:00:13.720 --> 04:00:14.670 align:start position:0%
have on the visitation that comes to
your

04:00:14.670 --> 04:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
District to assess your performance in
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
terms of the minimum standards for
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
public school approval I've seen several
 
04:00:25.990 --> 04:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
of them several years back a one-page
 
04:00:26.000 --> 04:00:27.389 align:start position:0%
of them several years back a one-page
handwritten

04:00:27.389 --> 04:00:27.399 align:start position:0%
handwritten
 
04:00:29.710 --> 04:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
job which
 
04:00:31.990 --> 04:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
conveys not a whole
 
04:00:35.950 --> 04:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
lot and that's my concern that we've
 
04:00:37.950 --> 04:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
been talking about competencies and all
 
04:00:40.349 --> 04:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
that but when they go out they don't
 
04:00:43.830 --> 04:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
have the staff to do this properly and
 
04:00:46.110 --> 04:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
it's partially our problem as a
 
04:00:48.389 --> 04:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
legislature we have not funded the
 
04:00:50.229 --> 04:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education with a
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum and the other Personnel
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
necessary to comply with it's like Steve
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
applebe sent out the request for
 
04:01:00.429 --> 04:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent to respond on the teacher
 
04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
shortage business has responsed
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
20% Then it got it up at the high level
 
04:01:07.239 --> 04:01:08.750 align:start position:0%
20% Then it got it up at the high level
56%

04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
56%
 
04:01:11.469 --> 04:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
that is very embarrassing and it's not
 
04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with statutory law
 
04:01:17.670 --> 04:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
they're required to report this but
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's no way of making sure that
 
04:01:22.189 --> 04:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
occurs we don't have the staff to do
 
04:01:23.710 --> 04:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
that and we don't have he doesn't have
 
04:01:23.720 --> 04:01:26.149 align:start position:0%
that and we don't have he doesn't have
the

04:01:26.149 --> 04:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:29.950 --> 04:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
hammer there is a resolution to that the
 
04:01:31.790 --> 04:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
resolution of that is that if the state
 
04:01:35.149 --> 04:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
provided more funding to local school
 
04:01:38.269 --> 04:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
districts they could basically say if if
 
04:01:40.670 --> 04:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
you don't return this back guess what
 
04:01:44.590 --> 04:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
we're holding your your adequacy money I
 
04:01:46.389 --> 04:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
I think they did that with the emergency
 
04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
plans trying to get the emergency
 
04:01:49.040 --> 04:01:50.630 align:start position:0%
plans trying to get the emergency
PL

04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
PL
 
04:01:53.830 --> 04:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah there's not a big stick that
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
the right that's unfortunate yeah
 
04:01:59.670 --> 04:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
because there's places the state does
 
04:01:59.680 --> 04:02:01.910 align:start position:0%
because there's places the state does
need

04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
it so are we going to who's you're going
 
04:02:07.269 --> 04:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
to write an amendment just to rpe out
 
04:02:09.269 --> 04:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
the word comprehensive there so we have
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
it in our pocket okay thank and put on
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
type yeah committee
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment if everybody's good with that
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
if we have to go that route if we have
 
04:02:26.910 --> 04:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
to go that route now if we have 306 come
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
in saying it's staying there I'm not so
 
04:02:31.790 --> 04:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
sure we got to do anything I I think if
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
Pope's going to do it I don't think she
 
04:02:35.229 --> 04:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
can put committee on it it'll go
 
04:02:36.910 --> 04:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
committee when it when it gets voted by
 
04:02:40.030 --> 04:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
the committee yeah I think have H well
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
she can do it then if you want to do it
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
hope go for it
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay and everybody else think about it
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know and hopefully we'll get a
 
04:02:52.830 --> 04:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
response on the
 
04:02:55.910 --> 04:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
n9th anything else yes any chance we can
 
04:02:58.870 --> 04:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
get a hard copy of those new rigs when
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%

took all that and put it back in I know
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
right and and so we're reading stuff
 
04:03:10.920 --> 04:03:13.550 align:start position:0%
right and and so we're reading stuff
that's

04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:03:17.229 --> 04:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
