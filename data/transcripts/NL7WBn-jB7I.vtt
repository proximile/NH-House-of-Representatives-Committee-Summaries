we have to get a budget
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
enough

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman seaworth I'd like to make

00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
motion is made in second your
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to your motion thank
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
um I have
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
prepared an amendment on this bill I
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
think I passed it out to everyone who
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
needed a copy if not there are copies on
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
the table
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
I think I I know I speak for myself I
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
would say most of the committee maybe
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
all of the committee we support and
 
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work that Employment
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
Securities does to make sure that
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
workers who are unemployed
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
get the support to which they're
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
entitled I I don't think that's a
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
controversial statement
 
00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:14.450 align:start position:0%
controversial statement
um

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'll also add that for me every time
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
that the department comes in and and
 
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
speaks on an issue of the details of how
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
they are administered administrating
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
their programs I learned something and I
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
usually learn a lot
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
um briefly and maybe my kind of briefly
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
hopefully not uh I'll cover some of that
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
because I know not everyone was here
 
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
um this bill addresses a situation where
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
let's say I'm an unemployed worker and I
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
file for benefits
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
does everybody have the copies I know I
 
00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059 align:start position:0%
have a whole stack here but I want to
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone in the committee has
 
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
the amendment for
 
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
yes okay I just want to make sure I
 
00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
still have a pile here thank you go
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
so yes the situation is I'm in I'm an
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
employee I file for uh benefits and
 
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
receive money to which I am not entitled
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
and uh what I learned is that there are
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
three specific cases to this
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
two of which this bill doesn't touch at
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
all and the third of which the bill and
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
the amendment deal with the first is
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
where it's through absolutely no fault
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
of my own
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
I did everything as as best I understood
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
the process money comes to me that I
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have had and in that case I
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
don't I get to keep it I don't have to
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
pay it back and I I think we all agree
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
that that's fair
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
um and just and maybe in some cases a
 
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
little generous but I I don't think any
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
of us have an issue with that part
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
the second process is where I have
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
fraudulently decided I'm going to go get
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
some money that I am not entitled to and
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
I I do something to to take that money
 
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539 align:start position:0%
essentially I'm stealing money from the
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
other workers in New Hampshire who need
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
and are entitled to those benefits in
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
that case
 
00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:34.549 align:start position:0%
that case
um

00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
first of all there's a process where if
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
the department says that's what I did
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's an administrative process for
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
them I can I can object I can appeal
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
once that's decided I have 60 days to
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
give the money back if I don't give the
 
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
money back then it begins accruing
 
00:23:54.659 --> 00:23:56.570 align:start position:0%
money back then it begins accruing
interest

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.169 align:start position:0%
interest
um

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
and furthermore and this I learned
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's probably the least of my worries
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
because I've committed a criminal act
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
and the department is almost certainly
 
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to come after me with criminal
 
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.350 align:start position:0%
going to come after me with criminal
charges

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
charges
 
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.610 align:start position:0%
charges
again

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:24:14.049 --> 00:24:14.059 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't touch that I I think
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
we all think that's a fair way to deal
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
with somebody who's stealing money
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill goes after is the third
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
case which is in between the two I did
 
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.210 align:start position:0%
case which is in between the two I did
something

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:28.220 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
improper it is my fault that I am now
 
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
receiving those benefits to which I am
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
not entitled
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't rise to the level of
 
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.649 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't rise to the level of
criminality

00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
criminality
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
so in that case the original Bill said
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
well the the original we'll start with
 
00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
the original Law the law says again
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
there's there may be an administrative
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
process where we can determine whether I
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
am in fact in that category once that's
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
determined I have 60 days to pay back
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
the money if I do not then there will
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
begin to accrue interest on the portion
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
of the money I still owe
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
the bill says no
 
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
after 60 days if I don't pay the money
 
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.230 align:start position:0%
after 60 days if I don't pay the money
back

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.059 align:start position:0%
but I still owe it but there's no
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
penalty for not paying it back my
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
amendment I think
 
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
it kind of splits the difference and in
 
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
a way that is useful it despite the
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
length of the amendment
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
um it really only changes that shell the
 
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
department shall charge zero percent
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
interest to a may it it gives the
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
discretion to the department to charge
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
up to the one percent that's currently
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
anything in between including zero so
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
they will now through their rules have
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
the discretion to Define well when is
 
00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:57.020 align:start position:0%
charging interest
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
necessary or helpful and when is waiving
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
the interest in the best interest of
 
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
everyone involved
 
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.289 align:start position:0%
everyone involved
um

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:10.220 align:start position:0%
as I said the LA it's a lot of words for
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
changing a shell to a may we did work
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
with the Department in coming up with
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
this this is by and large the language
 
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
that they suggested to do what we want
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
to do and do it right there's a couple
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
of changes that OLS made but other than
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
that this is the way the people who
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
administer this program told us is the
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
right way to do it
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
in my opinion uh amended this way this
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
accomplishes most
 
00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:48.260 align:start position:0%
of what the original Bill intended to do
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
it might avoid some unintended
 
00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:54.020 align:start position:0%
consequences where you
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
where someone just won't pay back the
 
00:26:59.409 --> 00:26:59.419 align:start position:0%
money that they owe and you have no
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
incentive to ask them to do it
 
00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.850 align:start position:0%
incentive to ask them to do it
um

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so I
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
hope that everyone will support this
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
bill as amended thank you questions
 
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
I I will say I do support the bill
 
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539 align:start position:0%
um I do not support the amendment I told
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
the chair yesterday that I would listen
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
with an open mind but since that time
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
I've really looked at it and thought
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
um and that middle category is one that
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
gives me some concern
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
um the um and there's a two basic issues
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
that I've got with it
 
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.049 align:start position:0%
that I've got with it
um

00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
the first is providing discretion to the
 
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
department and this is not saying
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
anything negative about the department
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
but basically it allows the department
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
to to decide who pays interest and who
 
00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't and
 
00:27:59.340 --> 00:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't and
um

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
not having seen the rules at this point
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
that uh where the rules will be very
 
00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:07.460 align:start position:0%
specific or very or somewhat broad
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
I have a concern against bias we all
 
00:28:14.769 --> 00:28:14.779 align:start position:0%
have bias we live in a country that uh
 
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
deals with discrimination and I would
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
hate to find somewhere down the line
 
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
that interest is being charged to
 
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
various specific segments of the uh
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
um the population while not being
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
applied to others and again I probably
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be intentional but it could
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
happen because bias exists
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
that's my first concern
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
my second concern is um
 
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
with the type of folks who might find
 
00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:50.900 align:start position:0%
themselves in the situation
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who end up on
 
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.330 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who end up on
unemployment

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:55.340 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
are really living hand to mouth and they
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
really and by the time the mistake is
 
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
identified they may have gotten several
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
payments they would have spent those
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
payments and now they're being required
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
to not only pay them back but
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
potentially pay interest on it paying it
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
back is a real problem for a lot of
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
people because you already spent it it's
 
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.029 align:start position:0%
people because you already spent it it's
gone

00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
gone
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
um so they don't really have the money
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
to pay it back and that creates a
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
challenge for a lot of folks
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
um but uh charging interest on top of
 
00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:30.950 align:start position:0%
um but uh charging interest on top of
that

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
um could make it a very difficult
 
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
situation for people who are really on
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hard Times
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
um so um you know I'm I'm more
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the status quo of uh
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
charging interest when someone commits
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
fraud no problem with that if you
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
um if you steal from
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
Employment Security you ought to be
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
penalized with interest and with the
 
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.130 align:start position:0%
penalized with interest and with the
criminal

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.590 align:start position:0%
criminal
um

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
consequences as well but if you make an
 
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:01.700 align:start position:0%
honest mistake
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
even if it's a foolish mistake it's not
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
a simple process maintain you've got to
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
apply every week as we all know in any
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
one of those weeks you can make them
 
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:15.860 align:start position:0%
make an error and if that error
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
turns out to um
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
cause your payments to be too high yes
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
you should pay it back but no you should
 
00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:27.299 align:start position:0%
not pay interest so I would be in
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to the amendment thank you
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:34.919 --> 00:30:35.570 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the current practice
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
of the department is not to seek blood
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
from the stone
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
and I think they already have the
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
ability to weigh whether or not
 
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
something was intentional certainly that
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
and whether or not it's worth the
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
expense to pursue something
 
00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
and so I really I think I'd also like to
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
understand have a better understanding
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
of an example or two of a situation
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
where it's not fraud it's not their
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
fault but it kind of is their fault but
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
they didn't do it on purpose I'd like to
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
well I wonder if Mr lavers could help
 
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:12.299 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple of these issues for us
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
if he'd be willing
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he's willing
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:27.409 align:start position:0%

00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
Jessica
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
waivers welcome
 
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh thank you just for the
 
00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:33.059 align:start position:0%
record Richard laborers Deputy
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Employment Security
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
um so so just to clarify a few points as
 
00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
we've talked about before and I think
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth a very
 
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.830 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth a very
um

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
um he's clearly been listening when I've
 
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
been talking so that's good I appreciate
 
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.810 align:start position:0%
been talking so that's good I appreciate
that

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.029 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
when someone is paid benefits for which
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
they are later determined to be
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
ineligible because it's an eligibility
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
based program we're not we're not an
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
entitlement program eligibility based
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
program and that eligibility goes week
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
to week when your paid benefits for
 
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
which you should not have been paid and
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
it is not your fault
 
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419 align:start position:0%
the department made a mistake
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
the employer made a mistake
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
you never have to repay those benefits
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
right you're you're waived of those it's
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
payments out of the trust fund that you
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
should not have received but we're
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
you know we call it for what it is we
 
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
screwed up you keep that
 
00:32:39.889 --> 00:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about benefits that
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
are paid for which you are later
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
determined not to be eligible
 
00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:48.419 align:start position:0%
but it's not the eligibility issue that
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
came into question
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
is not one where the department screwed
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
up it's not one where the employer
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
screwed up it's one where the individual
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
provided information or did not provide
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
information which
 
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
they knew was inaccurate or information
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
they knew was relevant and needed to be
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
provided and they didn't
 
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
so in that situation where we make a
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
determination that you are with fault
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
you have to repay and there's interest
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
that accrues
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
now like all determinations that get
 
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
issued from the Department you have an
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to challenge that you
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
receive that determination you disagree
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
with it you have a period of time of 14
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
days to file an appeal
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
you have an opportunity for a de novo
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
hearing a brand new Hearing in front of
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
a hearing officer
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
and you can make your pitch you can make
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
your story as to why you feel
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
that the characterization of you being
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
if you disagree with the decision issued
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
by the appeal hearing officer you can
 
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
again appeal that
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
if you disagree with the decision on
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
review of that appeal hearing officer's
 
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.570 align:start position:0%
review of that appeal hearing officer's
decision

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
you can appeal that to our appellate
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
board and ultimately if you disagree
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
with the Appellate board you can go to
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of there's multiple
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
layers of opportunity if you feel the
 
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
department has simply not heard you
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
or has inaccurately characterized your
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
behavior and actions taken that led to
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
you being paid when you were not
 
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.470 align:start position:0%
you being paid when you were not
eligible

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
and it's only after that process is
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
completely exhausted
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
as much or as little as you want to
 
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.770 align:start position:0%
as much or as little as you want to
utilize

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
that the department then has a situation
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
where you are considered overpaid
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
and need to repay that back
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
60 days from that date if you still owe
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
that debt or a portion of that debt
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
interest starts to accrue
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the situation we're
 
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
and now
 
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.470 align:start position:0%
and now
particular

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
um examples of
 
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
situations where someone could be found
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
to be with fault
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
but might not rise to the level of fraud
 
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
and they'd be in this camp this this
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
group that we're looking at here
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
perhaps you mischaracterize the
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
circumstances of your separation
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
so you file your initial claim
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
you provide us with a description of
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
the employer maybe doesn't immediately
 
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.390 align:start position:0%
the employer maybe doesn't immediately
respond

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
we make an effort to get that response
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
but the employer doesn't immediately
 
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.690 align:start position:0%
but the employer doesn't immediately
respond

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
we pay you benefits
 
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
the employer then responds providing us
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
more credible information as determined
 
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.210 align:start position:0%
more credible information as determined
by

00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
a certifying officer at the department
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
that the way you characterize your
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
separation was not correct
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
it was not accurate it was unreasonable
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
in what you characterize it as based
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
upon better information more reliable
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
information provided by the employer
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
now you're going to be overpaid
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
and would be with fault
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
another situation perhaps
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
you were a little bit
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
fast and loose with your
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
description of your work search efforts
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
on a weekly basis so each week you have
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
to certify to the department what you
 
00:36:38.099 --> 00:36:38.930 align:start position:0%
to certify to the department what you
did

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
for activities and Outreach in order to
 
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
stay connected to the labor market to
 
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
satisfy that Weekly work search
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
requirement and maybe we find that some
 
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
of it some of it wasn't true
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
an employer that you say you outreached
 
00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
to you've submitted a resume to
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
the employer then says this did not
 
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:01.910 align:start position:0%
the employer then says this did not
happen

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
or certain activities that you say that
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
you did perhaps attending a job fair
 
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
that we put on and we come to find out
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
that you did not attend
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
in that situation we're going to find
 
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
that you are overpaid and with fault
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have the opportunity
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
to appeal it you're going to have the
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to challenge it
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
But ultimately
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
if it's decided that you are overpaid
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
with fault you'll have to repay the
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
benefits and you'll have to
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
have interest at a cruise while that
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
debt remains outstanding
 
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.650 align:start position:0%
debt remains outstanding
um

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:39.609 --> 00:37:39.619 align:start position:0%
what I what I think came across and and
 
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
listening and and hearing the the the
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsoring Senator Senator Whitley
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
the reasons for filing the bill and
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
others who are supportive of it there's
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
some concern around those situations and
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
how we are determining fault or without
 
00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.390 align:start position:0%
how we are determining fault or without
fault

00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
fault
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
and then requiring someone to repay
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
those benefits in the interest that
 
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.790 align:start position:0%
those benefits in the interest that
accrues

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
accrues
 
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.170 align:start position:0%
accrues
and

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
I think the the rule making process can
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
actually serve a useful purpose in that
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
regard and I can't speak for other
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
agencies and how they utilize the
 
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
administrative rulemaking process but
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
how the department has done that
 
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
historically over the past decade
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
has been to work collaboratively with
 
00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legal assistance and
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
anytime we're looking to implement rules
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
that impact unemployment benefit
 
00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:34.550 align:start position:0%
that impact unemployment benefit
payments

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
we have a good track record I can say
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
that from the I think the department has
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
a good track record of working
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with them
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
it goes back to
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
close to 10 years ago when working
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
closely with Dan feltis and Sarah Matson
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
when we were looking to implement rules
 
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
on the compromise process
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
so the process that the department
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
implements when someone
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
seeks forgiveness of an overpayment
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
that was a very exhaustive process a lot
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
of meetings
 
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.670 align:start position:0%
of meetings
um

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
I didn't get everything that
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
I originally wanted and probably neither
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
did Dan or Sarah but we've reached a
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
point where we were in agreement that we
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
had a good set of rules to have a
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
process in place for when people request
 
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
forgiveness of a debt
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
we then did the same thing more recently
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
with regard to an individual's ability
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
to continue to get paid benefits when
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
they are determined to to or they they
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
have initial eligibility and then they
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
lose eligibility at some point during
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
their claim and they file an appeal
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
there's a New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
decision that says in those situations
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
an individual can make an election to
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
continue to receive benefits knowing
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
full well if they are if they fail
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
they'll have to pay those back
 
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
we had rule we had rules that expired
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
we worked with New Hampshire legal
 
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
assistance we had a very valuable
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
discussion around the issue
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
and we proceeded with that rulemaking so
 
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
I think we have a good track record of
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
working with them working with legal
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
assistance I'll let them characterize it
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
or describe it however they they would
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
like but what we would do if this
 
00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:25.619 align:start position:0%
amended Bill were to become law is we'd
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
have to start the rulemaking process
 
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
we would do that by starting with New
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance
 
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
having discussions like we've done
 
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.990 align:start position:0%
having discussions like we've done
before

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
telling them these are situations where
 
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
we think interests should be charged
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
they could then describe to a situations
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
where they don't feel interest should be
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
charged and then we try to be able to
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
put that into appropriate language for
 
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
rules so that there there's a lack of
 
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.650 align:start position:0%
rules so that there there's a lack of
discretion

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
on the part of the department in
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding and that when our hearing
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
officers and our certifying officers are
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
are making that decision they have
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully clear guidance between statute
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
and rule on what they're supposed to do
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
given the circumstances
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of situations where interest
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
would accrue on a situation where
 
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
someone is found with fault
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
and a little bit of a explanation on how
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
the department would go about rulemaking
 
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.990 align:start position:0%
the department would go about rulemaking
if

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment were to pass
 
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
um and I and I think
 
00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
um and I and I think
um

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
rulemaking can be very valuable
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of work
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
people have other things they would
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
probably prefer to be doing
 
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
but rulemaking can be very valuable so
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the product that you get down the
 
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:50.220 align:start position:0%
road is something that all sides can
 
00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.410 align:start position:0%
road is something that all sides can
agree

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
is what we feel should be happening in
 
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances and again we
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
try to take the discretion out of it by
 
00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.329 align:start position:0%
try to take the discretion out of it by
having

00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:41:59.339 --> 00:42:00.170 align:start position:0%
having
um

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
a good solid rule-making process and
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
good solid discussion for both sides
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
both the department and other interested
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
groups on where the concerns lie and how
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
can we can go go about addressing that
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that's what you know if this were
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
were to pass that's how the department
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
would implement it
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Cahill
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
this is not a hearing who are you and
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
Senator with
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Senator I didn't know who you
 
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
are I've never met you before
 
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.650 align:start position:0%
are I've never met you before
um

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:44.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
feel free to speak
 
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair I really do
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak I am
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
glad here because that I'm here because
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
I actually have not seen this amendment
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
um which is I I have to say it is
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
disappointing to me
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
um because the department actually
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
didn't oppose this bill in either the
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
senate or the house and so it's
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
surprising to me that they would work on
 
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.339 align:start position:0%
an amendment to really gut the bill and
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's what this amendment does it
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
really does gut the bill I think the
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
Senate felt pretty strongly that the
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
collection of Interest was really overly
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
punitive and that this bill was very
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to New Hampshire so I
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
think I mentioned in the hearing on this
 
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
the federal government actually does not
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
allow interest to be collected on any
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
overpayments whereas the bill was a more
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored uh solution for New
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to prohibit the collection of
 
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
Interest where fraud was not involved so
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
I think the senate had worked really
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
hard to just think about a solution that
 
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
worked for New Hampshire residents the
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
collection of interest you know has not
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
been really shown to change behavior
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't it doesn't uh amount to a
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
significant amount of Revenue at all you
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
know I I believe it's less than 100 or
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
200 000 but yet for the people that it's
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
charged to it's very very very uh
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
dramatic and I will say the reason why
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
the Senate felt like this was such an
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
important policy
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
is that the people that were really
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
impacted but the people that lost the
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
most jobs frankly were women and the
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
women that who were at the front lines
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
and so this is a uh I I don't want I
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
don't like to make every issue a
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
gendered issue but the in this case we
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
know that the data is in particular
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
um women my age or younger than me
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
frankly at this point of you know our
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
working mothers they have not come back
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
to the workforce we saw a dramatic 10
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
percent uh
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
Exodus and they just haven't come back
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
to the workforce so I think instead of
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
thinking about policies to uh penalize
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
these people we should think about
 
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
policies to bring them back
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and so the other thing that I wanted
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
to mention is that
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
um you know when we're talking about you
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
know the different branches of
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
government of course do you have the
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
executive branch of which the department
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
is part of and we're the legislative
 
00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:26.339 align:start position:0%
branch and I think this is a case where
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
you know the department has said again
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
when they did not oppose this in either
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
bodies they said this is a policy
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
decision for the legislature and so I
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
think the Senate was very clear in their
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
policy position that charging interest
 
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
in this tiny circumstances was really
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
overly punitive so I would encourage you
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
all to stake that
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
um put that stake in the ground as a
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
legislative branch and say you know it's
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
overly punitive it's not necessary we
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
got to get these folks back to work and
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a small way to do that so
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate everyone's time and
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
your thoughtful consideration of this
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
really important bill and I don't know
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
if people have questions but I'll stay
 
00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Senator I'm not
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
going to open it up for hearing this is
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
not a hearing this is executive session
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know thank you Senator sorry I
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
didn't know who you were
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you Mr
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
chairman I I want to clarify something
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
because there was a suggestion that
 
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
somehow the department is doing
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
something inappropriate I want to make
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
it very clear for the record that this
 
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.230 align:start position:0%
it very clear for the record that this
language

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
this was my request this was what I
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
thought would make the bill better
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
for workers and for the Department to do
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
the job that we ask them to do
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I suggested some language on my own I
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
sent it to the department for comments
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
and they came up with what I think is
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
better language and so that's why I
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
submitted what I did so I just want that
 
00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
any other comments we have a motion on
 
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh if if I'm correct
 
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
here on this
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment um and from what uh
 
00:47:20.809 --> 00:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
you know the the uh the
 
00:47:20.819 --> 00:47:21.530 align:start position:0%
you know the the uh the
um

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
director said there uh there's degrees
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
um and if you you know you can tell a
 
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
white lie and maybe end up with a little
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
little extra extra cash here and you get
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
caught uh and we won't charge your
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
interest maybe but then there's other
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
degrees of lying where it's an outright
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
lie and and you were quiet and uh you
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
know and you will be charged the the um
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know the higher rate the one up to
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
the one percent
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't find anything wrong with that
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
I mean uh you know nobody should be
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
lying to get money uh it's it's plain
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
thievery and um you know I think this is
 
00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.690 align:start position:0%
thievery and um you know I think this is
a

00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
um more than a Great Compromise
 
00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:05.339 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McKenzie
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
um my experience with the unemployment
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
system is they have a fairly robust uh
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
set of rules and regulations and laws
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
as an employee
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh as a worker as somebody who has to
 
00:48:25.329 --> 00:48:25.339 align:start position:0%
file in this system
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
negotiating through all of those
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
different things uh and making a mistake
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
along the way is not
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's not out of touch because many
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
people as you heard how difficult and
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
how many different aspects are out of
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
um I think we've got enough uh in place
 
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.329 align:start position:0%
um I think we've got enough uh in place
already

00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
I think we have enough uh to that can
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
happen they can they can work with I
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
think there's there's enough rules and
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
regulations uh in the system
 
00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
two things is for me is who helps the
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
employee through the process
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
the work that's with not the employee
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
working through the process uh and the
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
second thing what happens when when
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
somebody cannot pay that they don't have
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
the capacity to pay this money uh back
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
which for unemployed workers who've been
 
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
out for a period of time and all of a
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
sudden realize oh my goodness I have all
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
this uh you know have all this
 
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility now is that driving
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
people into bankruptcy so what is the
 
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
impact on that and how is it that this
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
the department tests their ability to
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
pay uh I don't think for the most part
 
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
people are lying necessarily I I mean
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion it's not fact uh but I
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
do think that people make mistakes and
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
mistakes that could get them in trouble
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
and probably not intentionally but if
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
you're an unemployed worker and you've
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
been out for a while and you're under a
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
lot of stress and your family is you
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
know you're worried about how you're
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to feed your family and how you're
 
00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
going to pay your bills
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
um maybe you move too fast and maybe you
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
can make some mistakes along the way and
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
I think that Department currently has
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
the capacity in the infrastructure
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
within there within their uh their
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
current laws to deal with a lot of this
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
stuff I don't think we need this I don't
 
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
think we need more and to be honest with
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
you in uh in support of my colleague I
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't want discretion necessarily in the
 
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
law uh I think our responsibility you
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
know I did contracts for a long time I
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
don't like discretion I like things to
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
be stated clearly what the rules are and
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
what the expectations are for this uh
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
for anybody and I think laws should
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
should do that public policy should be
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
clear so I would object to the uh to
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
this amendment and we'll vote against it
 
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
Jim Madam Clerk
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
um he addressed most of what I was going
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
to say but I would love
 
00:50:50.089 --> 00:50:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
all right just seeing no other uh hands
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
I was also part of the amendment
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of the met with Brian we
 
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
discussed this and so uh I agree with
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
them don't blame the department you can
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
blame the two of us if you'd like
 
00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of surprised
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
um it it what I'm hearing about the
 
00:51:12.059 --> 00:51:13.849 align:start position:0%
um it it what I'm hearing about the
discretion

00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:51:13.859 --> 00:51:16.490 align:start position:0%
discretion
because

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
the 16 or 18 years I've been hanging
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
around on this committee
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
we have let the Department of Labor have
 
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of discretion
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
almost all of our laws regarding
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
labor laws
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
say may versus shell
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
so when someone goes two years without
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
workers compensation and the bill is
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars because it's
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollars plus one
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars per person per day
 
00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
we allow the department to have
 
00:51:47.339 --> 00:51:48.770 align:start position:0%
we allow the department to have
discretion

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
more often than not they'll say well
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
what would workers comp if cost you for
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
those two years four thousand dollars
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
fine that's your fine
 
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
no worth not worth putting anyone out of
 
00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.410 align:start position:0%
no worth not worth putting anyone out of
business

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
I rarely ever heard anyone say that the
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
was not prudent
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
with the discretion that the legislature
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
has given them I see no reason to think
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
that Employment Securities would not
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
utilize their discretion
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
because there are some situations
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
where I believe they would very easily
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
not charge anyone interest
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
between someone who
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
just didn't understand a question and
 
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
how they answered it or someone that's
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
really close in the line of almost
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
committing fraud is a there's a big
 
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
I do trust the department
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:47.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
and understand remember
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
whose money this is
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
employers pay it
 
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
employees need it there to have it there
 
00:52:58.609 --> 00:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
when they need it
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's it and we try to keep it solvent
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
in the last two recessions we've kept it
 
00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.609 align:start position:0%
in the last two recessions we've kept it
solvent

00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
solvent
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have to borrow money
 
00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:07.790 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have to borrow money
um

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
maybe I am biased because I've been
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
hanging around here too long
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
and I trust what I've seen out of that
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
department through two recessions
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
but I will be supporting the amendment
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
so Madam Clerk
 
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.569 align:start position:0%
so Madam Clerk
emotional

00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative Prout sorry I thought
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
we're done
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman sorry your words
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
inspired me no words
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
um I also am going to support the
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and the one of the reasons is
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
is we're seeing interest rates climb
 
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
high and what I don't want to see is
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
somebody compare
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
a essentially zero interest obligation
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
on one hand to what they can get from a
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
bank if they stall
 
00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
and again as with you I trust the
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
department to use the discretion through
 
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
the rules that we give them to try to
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
draw the right line in in between those
 
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:04.370 align:start position:0%
draw the right line in in between those
circumstances

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk he inspired me
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
I just also would like to add being
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
inspired by that comment that
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe if the Employment
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
Security Office had underpaid and it was
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
determined later had underpaid an
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
employment to someone who was unemployed
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
they don't receive any interest on the
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
missed unemployment they get just the
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
basic rate and really that's what we're
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
talking about here is interest on
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
um unemployment that was not fraudulent
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
I feel like in the hearing originally
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
most of the discussion ended up being
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
about fraud even though that wasn't what
 
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
the bill discussed at all
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
um I could one thing I'll just plant a
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
seed in this for the future
 
00:54:50.339 --> 00:54:51.170 align:start position:0%
seed in this for the future
um

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
if you haven't gone
 
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
through the unemployment process it is
 
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:56.930 align:start position:0%
through the unemployment process it is
eye-opening

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
eye-opening
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
a majority of what you're told
 
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
is about fraud and a video is shown of
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
people who had committed fraud and they
 
00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:09.059 align:start position:0%
were as a part of their sentence or
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
agreement or whatever filmed saying
 
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
something pretty uh
 
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.370 align:start position:0%
something pretty uh
potent

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
potent
 
00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
about don't commit fraud don't go to
 
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
jail like I did essentially and each
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
week you have to report what you earned
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
or didn't earn if you were if you look
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
for work all those things that we've put
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
in place as in the policy as legislators
 
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
you have to agree each week I did look
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
for work I with at least two employers I
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
did a report to the best of my ability
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
any money I earned in that week all
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of things are in it every week and
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
I will say
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
um that process is pretty cumbersome and
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
eye-opening and I think it would be
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
helpful to understand that process in
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
the future and
 
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.109 align:start position:0%
the future and
um

00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
it kind of feels like being unemployed
 
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
is any stigma you have about you know
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
having your self-worth being tied to
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
your work uh the process while in many
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
ways reasonable does not help does not
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
help that so to add Notions about
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
um fraud in a bill that
 
00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't say
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
anything about the interest for people
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
committing fraud
 
00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:35.089 align:start position:0%
committing fraud
um

00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:35.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:38.099 align:start position:0%
I think what was fair because the the
 
00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.099 align:start position:0%
bill itself is discussing in the
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
non-fraud cases this is what happens
 
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
with interest rate
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
um for overpayments and again it doesn't
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
address underpayments if that's
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
determined later so I think in that way
 
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
it is a fairly
 
00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.790 align:start position:0%
it is a fairly
bipartisan

00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
non-controversial straightforward bill
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
I'm glad everyone is inspired
 
00:57:11.569 --> 00:57:11.579 align:start position:0%
representative well what I heard if I
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
could message you uh what I heard is
 
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.809 align:start position:0%
could message you uh what I heard is
that

00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
um there may be a conflict with the
 
00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
federal law as it relates to this piece
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
and I'd be interested in some I don't
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
know I guess it's too late to have
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
people uh give us some some feedback on
 
00:57:30.849 --> 00:57:30.859 align:start position:0%
that but if that's the case then is this
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh is this out of um out of order uh at
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth I'll try to
 
00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:41.339 align:start position:0%
respond to that with the caveat that I'm
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
not an expert and could well get it
 
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
wrong my understanding with that comment
 
00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
is that federal law does not charge
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
interest rates so the difference is with
 
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
our current law
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
forget the bill the way we do it now New
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charges interest which
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
is not in federal law
 
00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.150 align:start position:0%
is not in federal law
um

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
this either version of the bill would
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
neither fix the
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
that issue nor would it make it worse
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
both the original bill and the amendment
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
reduce interest so
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that someone perceives
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
a problem it would make it less so uh I
 
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.790 align:start position:0%
a problem it would make it less so uh I
also

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
have to believe that if there were truly
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
a conflict that we were in violation of
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
any federal law that that would have
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
been brought up well before today
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
the question is over the interest that's
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
currently in law and has been in law for
 
00:58:58.930 --> 00:58:58.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know I know it's not a public
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
hearing so yeah well I've already the
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
Pandora's it's out of the box
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity again I
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
would agree with representative seaworth
 
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
um about his characterization the only
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
difference that I would say is that it
 
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
is the state when the when there are
 
00:59:24.049 --> 00:59:24.059 align:start position:0%
federal benefits involved it is the
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
state that administers them and federal
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
law says that the state can't charge
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
interest in any situation on those
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
Federal benefits
 
00:59:33.119 --> 00:59:34.490 align:start position:0%
Federal benefits
so

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
passage of the law as the Senate passed
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
it would just make
 
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
State policy consistent with federal
 
00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:45.770 align:start position:0%
State policy consistent with federal
policy

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner you have anything
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
um just a real brief uh the bill was
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
provided to the U.S department of labor
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
for review as to whether there are any
 
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
issues they came back and said no
 
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
because it is at the discretion of the
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
state as to whether or not interest is
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
charged or not charged with State paid
 
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
benefits and that's what we're talking
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
about here the federal benefits we're
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
talking about we're talking about
 
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
federally funded benefits
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
when those get implemented like they did
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic New Hampshire
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
businesses aren't paying those out of
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
their taxes those are coming from
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
federal resources
 
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
and those come with rules and those
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
benefit programs any overpayment could
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
not have interest attached to it so
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
federally funded no interest state
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
funded the feds look at it and say State
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
you do what you want we're not going to
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.849 --> 01:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
Sullivan followed by Cahill
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
I wanted to speak again simply so I
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
could be a man of my word
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
um I did tell the chair I would listen
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
with an open mind and I have listened to
 
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
the senator to the Deputy Commissioner
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
and to my colleagues
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and um I will say that my um
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
I'm still in the same place I just
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
cannot support this amendment thank you
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it thank you Senator Gail
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I believe Mr
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
Granger's hand was up and you may not
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
have seen it so I would yield to Mr
 
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
Granger provided I get my say afterwards
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
all right representative Granger sorry I
 
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything to say that I'm
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
still mulling it it it seems to me as
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
though with with without interest
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility that someone could
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
make a like a lot of money off of the in
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
yeah there there seems to be a there's a
 
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:57.059 align:start position:0%
possibility of a scam Brewing but I
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
haven't figured it out and I don't want
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
to bring it forward without
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
it seems to me someone creative could
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
exploit this pretty heavily without any
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
interests thank you representative kale
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
 
01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.370 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
um

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
I also have complete confidence in the
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
department and the and the discretion in
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
the way they have used it and continue
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
to use it and while I I don't know that
 
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
the amendment does harm it does sound a
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Labor's words like a lot of work to
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
go through rules and I think they're
 
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
already doing a good job at this already
 
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
so I will support the bill but not the
 
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:33.950 align:start position:0%
so I will support the bill but not the
amendment

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:36.180 align:start position:0%

oh I'm sorry just briefly you are sorry

oh I'm sorry just briefly you are sorry
um

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that I that I decided
 
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
to work on an amendment is as I heard
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
the department discuss their process
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I realized that what we're taking
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
away with this bill is a tool in their
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
toolbox and I agree with my fellow
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative in the corner there they
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
have a process in place that allows them
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
to reduce
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh obligations it allows them to
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
schedule payment processes
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
um they already work with individuals
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
who are in this kind of gray area
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
looking at their circumstances looking
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
at their ability to pay and try to
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
adjust the payment
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
to that and what I heard during the
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
public testimony was several times it
 
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
was said well the one percent interest
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
that's in law we can't change that and
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
then it would go on to something that
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
they do do and uh
 
01:05:20.579 --> 01:05:22.030 align:start position:0%
they do do and uh
so

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
my solution which failed was well we can
 
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
change that but what I I cannot support
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
is completely taking away a part of the
 
01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.289 align:start position:0%
is completely taking away a part of the
process

01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:40.430 align:start position:0%
 
deliberately

01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
got themselves money to which they
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
weren't eligible but it's not quite
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
to the level that you can prove that
 
01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:53.420 align:start position:0%
that there's some
 
01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
veneer of deniability in it
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
maybe that person never intends to pay
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
back the money and to take away the one
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
tool that the department has to say you
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
know what after 60 days that you have to
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
start paying us back
 
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
I don't I can't see taking that away so
 
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:24.059 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to reiterate I was a
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
little iffy when I said this a little
 
01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
bit ago but now I'm going to say it more
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
clearly this is a bipartisan Bill
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
Senators Carson Innis and Lang and
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire are co-sponsors
 
01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
um I know representative McGuire fairly
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
well she and I typically do not agree on
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
economic issues so that she was willing
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
to support this bill as a co-sponsor I
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
think says a lot and that is my only
 
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
point there was a Mackenzie followed by
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
groups of Gail thank you
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman there's been a lot of work
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's gone into this from the Senate
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
and we've also worked on it as I as I
 
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
understand this this is a very narrow
 
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
and this narrow group of people uh uh
 
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
now or it could essentially be in two
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
different systems they're in
 
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
unemployment in the state system for a
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
while and then they trigger on to the
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
federal benefits so that's a whole other
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
environment so to me that introduces
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
another level of uh confusion for
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
unemployed workers who are trying to
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
navigate through the system I think what
 
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
the what as I understand it and what the
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
senator said is this and and by
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support we might add is that
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
this is simply a way of aligning the
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
state policy with the federal policy so
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
that this is the same rules under which
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
people operate again it's a very narrow
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
group of people to get into this
 
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
situation uh there are a whole lot of
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
reasons why they could be in this
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
situation but I I think it's a good bill
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
I think they worked hard I think they've
 
01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
got a good bipartisan group of
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and now I'm going to support
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
the bill uh as it as it comes before us
 
01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
and I hope that of this due on this
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:09.059 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kale thank you
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether or not there are
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
other tools in the Department's toolbox
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
such as garnishing wages in the event
 
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
that someone wasn't paying back and uh
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
and had a job I don't know if that's a
 
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
possibility but I in any event I I think
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
I I as I said earlier I think the
 
01:08:29.329 --> 01:08:29.339 align:start position:0%
department handles these situations well
 
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
as we have as as already with their with
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
their current rules and that this uh
 
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:35.950 align:start position:0%
their current rules and that this uh
bill

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
unamended is something that I can
 
01:08:40.849 --> 01:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
support but the amendment not so I I
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
hope that we will do the not choose not
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
to fight the
 
01:08:47.219 --> 01:08:47.870 align:start position:0%
to fight the
um

01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
the uh perfect for the seek the perfect
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
and the favor of the kill the good and
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
just defeat the ICL and let's pass this
 
01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:03.650 align:start position:0%
just defeat the ICL and let's pass this
thing

01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so it seems to me that in life
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at the incentives you'll
 
01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
figure out the outcome and it seems to
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
me that if there is no interest applied
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
at all then in a world where we have
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
record high inflation it is actually
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
profitable not to pay it back so if you
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
are getting zero you have basically a
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
zero interest loan and you know whether
 
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
you wanted it or not whether it was
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
intentional or not you have a zero
 
01:09:32.329 --> 01:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
interest loan and if you invest that in
 
01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
almost anything else in the meantime
 
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
you're actually going to yield a profit
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're gonna make more money by not
 
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
paying it back than you would by paying
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
it back therefore it seems to me that
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
unless there's some discretion I can't
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
support I can't support it at all now if
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
there was discretion where the
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
department had some ability to say well
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
you know if you're abusing the system or
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
you're taking your benefits and you're
 
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
putting into Bitcoin or whatever then
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to charge interest
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
on that at least that's something to
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
Tamp down on it but um in lieu of
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
anything just putting it zero across the
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
board that just seems like it's a great
 
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
way to just be abused
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
um that's what I was bowling over
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
earlier and it seems to me pretty any
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
any smart person who has been overpaid
 
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
on employment benefits will figure out
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
really quick that a zero interest loan
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
is basically a great way to make some a
 
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
maybe I feel compelled to say that I
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody is investing their
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits unemployment is to
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
keep people fed and housed
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
not to be invested in Bitcoin thank you
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
we all know how this is going to go down
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
we all know how the next vote is going
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
to go down so let's get to it
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative love followed by cell uh
 
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
representative love followed by cell uh
seaworth

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
seaworth
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
yeah earlier we heard thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
we heard about the the videos and stuff
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
that you know warning against fraud and
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh I want to give the people of New
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a little more credit than
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
being bona fide idiots if you if you're
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
sitting there watching this and you see
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
and you don't know how to uh how to
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
answer a question there's always
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
somebody to ask okay
 
01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's happened to me
 
01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's probably happened to others
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
um you know uh
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment I thought was great I
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
won't take a tool out of the out of the
 
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.550 align:start position:0%
won't take a tool out of the out of the
Department's

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
Department's
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
um toolbox I collect was referred to
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
um you know we've we can't just be open
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
for fraud
 
01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know like I said I'm not going to
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
vote for for this this bill because of
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:11:44.699 --> 01:11:45.770 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
I hear
 
01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
and and maybe I'm Mister interpreting
 
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
but some suggestion that who we're
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
talking about are people who are
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
on unemployment eligible for that they
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
need the money and I just want to
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
clarify that the category that we're
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
talking about are people who are not
 
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
talking about are people who are not
eligible

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
they don't need the money at least as
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
far as we the legislature has defined
 
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
that issue of need and they've gotten it
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
anyway and they won't pay it back and to
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
me that I all all the issues of someone
 
01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.709 align:start position:0%
me that I all all the issues of someone
who

01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:12:21.719 --> 01:12:22.850 align:start position:0%
who
um

01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
who through no fault of their own got
 
01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
money that they shouldn't have who are
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
eligible for the money I I agree with
 
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
everything that was said
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
um but the category that this bill
 
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
addresses is just not those people
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%

representative abalani you're recognized
 
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
to speak to your uh
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
to your motion thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
I've owned a small business for 17 years
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm old school I still pay
 
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
by paper check every Friday
 
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm probably the minority now I don't
 
01:16:37.739 --> 01:16:38.630 align:start position:0%
um I'm probably the minority now I don't
know

01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh our employees as everybody would
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
probably figure they have basically
 
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
three options they can go to the grocery
 
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
store get their check cashed they can go
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
to their personal bank or go to the bank
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
that we write the check from which
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
happens to be in town
 
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
um with modern technology Mo I would say
 
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
90 of our employees just go to their own
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
bank but with modern technology now they
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
just take a picture of it and it's
 
01:17:00.179 --> 01:17:01.250 align:start position:0%
just take a picture of it and it's
basically

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
a roundabout way of direct deposit so
 
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
it's pretty easy
 
01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
we don't get many complaints about
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
the way we pay actually
 
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
we don't get complaints and they would
 
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
tell us if there was an issue trust me
 
01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.149 align:start position:0%
tell us if there was an issue trust me
um

01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
so I think I think this current system
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
we have works pretty good and uh so this
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill there's quite a few things I can't
 
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
support but the one that I really want
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
to speak to is
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
um the 24 hour replacement
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
in the 17 years that I've owned a
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
business I'd say I've written out
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
thousands of checks I have never
 
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
had an employee lose a paycheck so maybe
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
I'm lucky I don't think so that just
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
never happened a few have gone through
 
01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:40.699 align:start position:0%
the wash
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh I've had a few that have coffee or
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
some weird substance on them that
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're just going to be cashed we just
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
wrote a new check everybody was happy
 
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
there was no issues
 
01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
there was no issues
um

01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
as a as a the business I'm in we have to
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
hand out gas cards and a few credit
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
cards we try to hand those out to the
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
people that are responsible
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
and are trustworthy and even then we
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
probably lose five to ten cards a year
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
that we have to replace same size card
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
as the payroll card that's being
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
proposed so I have no doubt
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm gonna have to replace a lot
 
01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.669 align:start position:0%
that I'm gonna have to replace a lot
more

01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
payroll by using a card rather than a
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
check just off my experience
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
and so now as a small business owner as
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
most of the state is you know we have
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
lives on the weekend we watch our kids
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
sports we go away and
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
and now we have to be called back
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
to replace a card within 24 hours that
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
is no fault of our own it's our
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
employees fault for losing it
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
so that just puts an extra burden on
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
business owners across the state
 
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
and if you factor in all the hidden fees
 
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
that go both to the employers and the
 
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
employees as you dive into the system a
 
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
little more it seems like it's just
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
creating it's trying to solve a problem
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
that I don't think really exists and in
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
the process of trying to solve that
 
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.350 align:start position:0%
the process of trying to solve that
problem

01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
creates even more burden and more
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
problems for both the employee and the
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
employer so with that being said I just
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
go ahead I apologize I'm sorry my my
 
01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
mind somewhere else go ahead
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
um I I'd agree with the itl motion it
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
seems to me as though this uh benefits
 
01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
uh a small handful of very very large
 
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
companies but it doesn't really but it
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
only serves as a hindrance to most small
 
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
companies and it also seems to me as
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
though this would be enabling
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
legislation for cbdc's and I am opposed
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
to cbdc's all over the place so any
 
01:19:44.689 --> 01:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
legislation that would Aid in the
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
adoption of Central Bank digital
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
currencies I would oppose
 
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
um I agree with the Ico motion
 
01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.270 align:start position:0%
um I agree with the Ico motion
um

01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
I think if a large company likes these
 
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
payroll cards
 
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
um legislation is already in place that
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
allows them to use them they can even
 
01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
encourage their employees to use them by
 
01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.219 align:start position:0%
selling the benefits of them and there
 
01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
may be benefits of some
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
and but I still remain skeptical that
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
all payroll cards are safe and uh user
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
friendly without fees Etc
 
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
um so maintaining the paper check option
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
I think is critical so um I will vote
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
all right see no other hands
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%

01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
representative I wouldn't have a copy of
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:38.709 align:start position:0%
the amendment
first

01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
correct well we're discussing the
 
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
amendment first yeah
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh see worth you're
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
recognize to uh speak your motion
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
um in this case this stems from a
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
conversation that some of us who are
 
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
hanging around after the public Hearing
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
in the room and uh the discussion came
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
up with it 10 days what is what does
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
that mean and I said well it
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
I I heard it meant two weeks and
 
01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
somebody else said no no I think it
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
means 10 calendar days and we we
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
couldn't really agree on what it meant
 
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that we would all
 
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
benefit from being specific and saying
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
what we mean so this amendment the
 
01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
difference between what's before you and
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment and what was in the
 
01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
original bill is one word and
 
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
um it's in that uh first line of the
 
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
bolded text what's added by the original
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
bill it says now within 10 business days
 
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
instead of just within 10 days so I
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
would ask that you support this uh
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
clarification to the original language
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
just as as I was trying to figure out
 
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
it was back and forth people weren't
 
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what they meant I did some
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
searching I couldn't find the main law
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
easily but as I was searching I found
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
other states and what was common was
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
either 14 or 15 days so I think I think
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
the 10 business days matches the
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
original intent I think it makes it
 
01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
consistent with other states that have
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
similar laws so I would ask for your
 
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
because I was Sullivan followed by
 
01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.189 align:start position:0%
because I was Sullivan followed by
Cahill

01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
Cahill
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I think I would have interpreted it
 
01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
as 10 consecutive days but I would agree
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
with uh representative seaworth that 10
 
01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:35.219 align:start position:0%
business days is better gives a little
 
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
more time and it is uh not going to be
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
confusing to anyone uh so I thank him
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
for the uh Amendment and I will support
 
01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.270 align:start position:0%
for the uh Amendment and I will support
it

01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill followed by
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
baroody thank you Mr chair and and I I
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
will support the amendment I do have a
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
concern as to whether those 10 days are
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
using the 24-hour clock which I know has
 
01:24:59.450 --> 01:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:04.130 align:start position:0%
 
report

01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate your levity
 
01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:08.149 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate your levity
representative

01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
and the other hands
 
01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie clarification so
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the case of a holiday that falls
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
within that 10 business days absolutely
 
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
then we refer back to the Cahill
 
01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.590 align:start position:0%
then we refer back to the Cahill
Amendment

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe a um holiday is
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
called considered a business day I think
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
if I may respond I thought about this uh
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
one of my first ideas was to be really
 
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:49.340 align:start position:0%
specific about what we meant by
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
yesterdays and no days and I finally
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
decided simpler is better there may be a
 
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
case where two sides of a negotiating
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
table can't agree whether this day
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
counts and that would end up before the
 
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
pelrb as would any other issue where the
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
two sides absolutely cannot agree
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
um in the end I decided that using
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
business days
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
exempts weekends exempts federal
 
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
holidays I think it's commonly
 
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
understood and it should be adequate for
 
01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.350 align:start position:0%
understood and it should be adequate for
99

01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
99
 
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
of of the issues that come up in the
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
negotiation representative Rudy
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I
 
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
agree with the amendment too if somebody
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
gave notice like uh tomorrow and then
 
01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
you had a three-day weekend you got
 
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
seven days gone almost eight days gone
 
01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
already uh maybe four days gone to give
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
a very short period of time to react and
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh I think that the business days really
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
seeing no other hands
 
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%

01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
I've said enough I'll leave it to
 
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
someone else thank you
 
01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:22.490 align:start position:0%
someone else thank you
representative

01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.050 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
we heard a couple bills earlier that
 
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
we're trying to move things that should
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
be negotiated into a contract into law
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
and we properly dispose of those
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
um I I feel that this also should be
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
part of the collective bargaining
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
process is to set the days four times to
 
01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:44.930 align:start position:0%
process is to set the days four times to
meet

01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
meet
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
um and not have this in law because this
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
is taking something that should be part
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the collective bargaining process and
 
01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:53.219 align:start position:0%
putting it into law which could be used
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
on either side to play the gotcha game
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
with the opposing side thank you Mr
 
01:28:58.679 --> 01:28:59.930 align:start position:0%
with the opposing side thank you Mr
chairman

01:28:59.930 --> 01:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
represent O'Brien uh thank you Mr
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for allowing me
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
to sit into this afternoon and sorry
 
01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
about the confusion earlier but sitting
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the table I'm sure
 
01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
representative uh McKenzie could agree
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
we both did it if you got tied up on
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
arguing about days and stuff like that
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
you get deeper problems in negotiations
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
than really that and to make it uh part
 
01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the collective bargaining agreement
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
if you can agree on a day you're not
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
going to get anything into the agreement
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
so therefore I think it's kind of moot
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
in my personal opinion and therefore you
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
know I support the bill
 
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sullivan
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:47.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
first of all this um
 
01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't come up here very
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
often I would agree with representative
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
O'Brien that uh
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
um it would come up in situations that
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
are truly dysfunctional
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
um but then it would be needed
 
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:30:07.729 --> 01:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
in answer to another thought that was
 
01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
expressed earlier the uh the dates and
 
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
deadlines for giving notice are actually
 
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
in statute so this is an issue that is
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
addressed in statute already and
 
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
actually the deadlines for completing
 
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.430 align:start position:0%
actually the deadlines for completing
negotiations

01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't think are in statute but I
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
think they've been established by
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
through the Supreme Court
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
um either that or they're in statute but
 
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
bottom line is much of the schedule for
 
01:30:34.689 --> 01:30:34.699 align:start position:0%
the bargaining process
 
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
is uh is determined by legislation so I
 
01:30:43.729 --> 01:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate here and again it
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
would not come up very often but when it
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
would come up it would be
 
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
um perhaps desperately needed because
 
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
clearly the parties are not cooperating
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
another one
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if there was another hand
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I am caught between a rock and a hard
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
because number one I do agree with the
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative avaloni
 
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
that we have dispensed with bills here
 
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
because it was the agreement of both
 
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle here that we
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't tell
 
01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't put things in legislation
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
should be dealt with at the bargaining
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
table between the parties usually done
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
by a representative of the management
 
01:31:36.410 --> 01:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
team and a representative of the of the
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh the bargaining group uh they get
 
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
together and they kind of like a jury
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
you know they said a time schedule and
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
what have you
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
I'm

01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
very cognizant
 
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
of the time period of which we are in
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
right now in the time period we're in
 
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
right now is the house doesn't like what
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate is doing the Senate doesn't
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
like what the house is doing on certain
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
things and we're going to mess with each
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
other's legislation until we get what we
 
01:32:06.239 --> 01:32:07.490 align:start position:0%
other's legislation until we get what we
want

01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
and I would hate this to go to committee
 
01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
a conference
 
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
and not have any uh members of
 
01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
Republican members of the committee be
 
01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:19.910 align:start position:0%
Republican members of the committee be
on

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference
 
01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
to work something out
 
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
my entire caucus is against
 
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh this bill
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
so I am going to vote in favor of the
 
01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
bill with the vice chairman
 
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
because I
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
would rather be involved
 
01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
than not involved
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
should this go to the committee
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
conference since we've amended the bill
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
well it's a simple thing they should
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
probably concur
 
01:32:57.890 --> 01:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
but you never know
 
01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:58.790 align:start position:0%
but you never know
um

01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.169 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
parliamentary procedure over over
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.729 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
um anyone else uh did I did I give
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
everyone what was the word represent
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
McKenzie did I give you an inspirational
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%

01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
we're moving up we have a minority
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
there will be Minority Report
 
01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:33.830 align:start position:0%
there will be Minority Report
representative

01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh Tuesday of next week
 
01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
all right Senate Bill 269 I would like
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
everyone's attention first because I
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
need to explain something
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
and I can do this quietly and you cannot
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
understand why or I can lay all the
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
cards in the table and I'm going to
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 269 comes with us
 
01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.330 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 269 comes with us
bipartisan

01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
from the Senate
 
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:13.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
I do not want to amend the bill
 
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
I think the amendment is significant
 
01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:19.510 align:start position:0%
I think the amendment is significant
enough

01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.729 align:start position:0%
 
requiring

01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
written notice
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
people to keep written notice in
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
gratuity perpetuity I guess for certain
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
things requires a new hearing
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
and we do not have time for a hearing
 
01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:46.340 align:start position:0%
at my disposal I have the ability
 
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
to reject the amendment
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
I have been
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
always very
 
01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:57.410 align:start position:0%
always very
um

01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
as Fair as I can
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
with representative uh Cahill
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
letting him bring motions even though
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
there weren't enough votes to pass his
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
motion uh to allow and to put his motion
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
out front
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I I try to be as is uh so we could
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
get it on the record and I try to be as
 
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
um Fair as I can
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
but this is the way this scenario would
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
go down
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
if I
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
make the motion not to accept
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
you can challenge me
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
if you challenge me it'll probably be a
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
10 to 10 vote
 
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
which means the challenge would go
 
01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:33.950 align:start position:0%
which means the challenge would go
nowhere

01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
nowhere
 
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
we can then vote
 
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
on the bill as is
 
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
that vote would be possibly a 10 10.
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
would then go to the floor as it is
 
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
let's say on the floor you do
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
get an amendment
 
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
passed goes to committee a conference
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay the committee a conference
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
pretty confident is going to be thrown
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
out by the Senate because the Senate
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
wants this the way they want it
 
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
um or we could also have a motion to
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
retain this bill
 
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
which I'm not sure is a good thing but
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
maybe the Department of Labor will lay
 
01:37:15.649 --> 01:37:15.659 align:start position:0%
off for a year and until we get it so
 
01:37:15.659 --> 01:37:20.570 align:start position:0%
off for a year and until we get it so
um

01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
I woke up at 6 15 this morning which I
 
01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.410 align:start position:0%
I woke up at 6 15 this morning which I
usually

01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
usually
 
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
am sleeping soundly
 
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
thinking about this and I don't like
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
I like waking up at 6 15 in the morning
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
and thinking about legislation
 
01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:35.930 align:start position:0%
and thinking about legislation
um

01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do and why because
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
what I think could happen
 
01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:45.659 align:start position:0%
you could agree with me you can disagree
 
01:37:47.209 --> 01:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
but I plan to not accept the motion if
 
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
there is a 10 10 to
 
01:37:56.810 --> 01:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
uh not to not pass the bill or excuse me
 
01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
if the emotion of ought to pass does not
 
01:38:02.290 --> 01:38:02.300 align:start position:0%
pass then the motion itl uh passes
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
that's a positive motion or they're both
 
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
excuse me if they both in the past 10 to
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
10 it goes to the floor with no
 
01:38:08.699 --> 01:38:10.729 align:start position:0%
10 it goes to the floor with no
recommendation

01:38:10.729 --> 01:38:10.739 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:38:10.739 --> 01:38:11.510 align:start position:0%
recommendation
um

01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
you can fight there
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
and if it passes it's going to committee
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
a conference
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
so that is the position I'm going to
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
make I think it's too significant
 
01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.270 align:start position:0%
make I think it's too significant
a

01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
um an amendment
 
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:26.510 align:start position:0%
um an amendment
um

01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
to not have a hearing and I can tell you
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
um if it does for some reason
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
um if I'm incorrect or some of the votes
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
today in the next half an hour and if it
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
does pass with this amendment I think
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
some voices like you haven't heard in a
 
01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
from a certain industry and from your
 
01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.550 align:start position:0%
from a certain industry and from your
senators

01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
senators
 
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.870 align:start position:0%
senators
so

01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
what I want
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
versus what I think is going to happen
 
01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
versus what I think is good legislating
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to put them all together
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
so that is what I'm going to do and that
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
is why and I thought everyone should
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
know why
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for your explanation
 
01:39:13.739 --> 01:39:15.050 align:start position:0%
thank you for your explanation
um

01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know that I agree with you
 
01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
that this requires a hearing but I
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
respect that that's your your thinking
 
01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.750 align:start position:0%
respect that that's your your thinking
um

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
if that is where we're at what I would
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
suggest so that we can have
 
01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
a full consideration of all aspects of
 
01:39:34.370 --> 01:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill and the potential
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I would suggest retaining the
 
01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.750 align:start position:0%
amendment I would suggest retaining the
bill

01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
um would allow us to uh to have that
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't I I agree that a hearing
 
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
now would be
 
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:45.169 align:start position:0%
now would be
um

01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
impossible no no time
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
um retaining the bill would allow us to
 
01:39:52.330 --> 01:39:52.340 align:start position:0%
have a hearing
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to um to vote on
 
01:39:58.490 --> 01:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
that Amendment or whichever way it goes
 
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
and then vote uh on on the bill itself
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
either amended it or not
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
um so that would be my request and my
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
suggestion thank you representative
 
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.530 align:start position:0%
suggestion thank you representative
Cahill

01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
Cahill
 
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for your
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
explanation of the uh the Parliamentary
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
situation the political situation
 
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to make a lot of trouble
 
01:40:22.610 --> 01:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
here it's never my intention as I
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
believe I've communicated to the
 
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
industry that I'm trying to be helpful I
 
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
support well I'm not crazy about tip
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
sharing if and I I think it's crazy that
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
they can't bring the topic up and talk
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
about it as it's part of their work
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
environment how the employees are to be
 
01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
paid I support that concept I'm just I
 
01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
merely offered a way for them to do a
 
01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
better job of it and if you'll indulge
 
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
me for just a moment I'd like to I'd
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
like to read something here which I
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
think is an illustration of why this is
 
01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:54.110 align:start position:0%
think is an illustration of why this is
needed

01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:57.890 --> 01:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
it was a very busy night the manager had
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
an extra busser come in to assist we tip
 
01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
out buses five percent of the total
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
amount of tip to DeWalt servers because
 
01:41:07.129 --> 01:41:07.139 align:start position:0%
we shared the tips in the pool the
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
manager told us we should tip out more
 
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
than five percent because there was
 
01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:13.139 align:start position:0%
three buses and not the usual two
 
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
when the manager went into the office
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
one of the more experienced servers said
 
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:20.219 align:start position:0%
is our tips she can tell us how to split
 
01:41:20.219 --> 01:41:21.649 align:start position:0%
is our tips she can tell us how to split
them

01:41:21.649 --> 01:41:21.659 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
so this is an example if you didn't have
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
that more experienced person who knew
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
what their rights and responsibilities
 
01:41:30.169 --> 01:41:30.179 align:start position:0%
were well then they they probably would
 
01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
have just well if that's what you wanted
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
us to do I guess we'll just give more of
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
our tips
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
you see this is a problem and I the
 
01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
document that uh uh was as I understood
 
01:41:42.649 --> 01:41:42.659 align:start position:0%
the industry like the document that I've
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
offered as a as a template as guidance
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
and they would be happy to send it to
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
their members but not every restaurant
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
entity with tip workers is a member of
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Restaurant Association
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is why I brought this amendment
 
01:41:58.250 --> 01:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
which I think would be protective of
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
both sides of the equation
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
so if you don't want to uh if you feel
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
that this is futile and not worth the
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
efforts to protect the worker and the
 
01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
business then I won't offer the
 
01:42:14.689 --> 01:42:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.169 --> 01:42:26.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
I am pausing because I am thinking
 
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.020 --> 01:42:59.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:59.930 --> 01:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna call a five minute recess I
 
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
want to speak with my vice chairman if
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
it dawned on me I didn't explain to some
 
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
of the newbies something some of you
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
will remember this about five years ago
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
I used to run those tough mudder things
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
you ever seen those things I've run
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
three of those stupid things
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
and the last thing you do is you get
 
01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
shocked when you go through oh like an
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
idiot why am I doing this a third time
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
I contracted uh
 
01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
Lyme disease
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
on one of my runs
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I didn't know what was going on and
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
I was messed up for three or four months
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
and and finally I went to the doctor and
 
01:54:30.609 --> 01:54:30.619 align:start position:0%
they said
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
you're a mess pal so as a result
 
01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes I forget certain things I'll
 
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
look at Dave duvet and I'll say his name
 
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
ten times and tomorrow I'll look at them
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember his name
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
and it takes me a couple seconds
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
so today I was looking at representative
 
01:54:49.619 --> 01:54:50.689 align:start position:0%
so today I was looking at representative
Granger

01:54:50.689 --> 01:54:50.699 align:start position:0%
Granger
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
and at back at the time my my vice
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
chairman at the time
 
01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.010 align:start position:0%
chairman at the time
um

01:54:58.010 --> 01:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
um would fill in the blanks for me
 
01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:01.310 align:start position:0%
um would fill in the blanks for me
sometimes

01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
because I forget names and I haven't
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
done it in a while so I apologize
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative Granger but uh I still
 
01:55:10.330 --> 01:55:10.340 align:start position:0%
have those lingering
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
lingering things so
 
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
were agreeing to listen to me and and
 
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
going forward uh we're gonna uh now open
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%

01:55:28.609 --> 01:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 269 and I uh call in
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%

motion the floor is ought to pass is
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%

01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:41.169 align:start position:0%
that second of my representative
Sullivan

01:55:41.169 --> 01:55:41.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
savalani you're recognized to speak and
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
then representative Sullivan thank you
 
01:55:47.450 --> 01:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:49.370 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
um

01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
when this bill first came before us
 
01:55:56.090 --> 01:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I I had some issues with it
 
01:55:58.370 --> 01:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
um upon talking with the people that
 
01:55:59.930 --> 01:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
have put it together
 
01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:00.649 align:start position:0%
have put it together
um

01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
have put my mind at ease upon certain
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
things and this seems to be an issue
 
01:56:07.970 --> 01:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
that the few restaurants are having
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Labor at this
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
time and this would clarify going
 
01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:13.609 align:start position:0%
time and this would clarify going
forward

01:56:13.609 --> 01:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
the issues and problems that they're
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
move that everyone support it as it's
 
01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:25.370 align:start position:0%
move that everyone support it as it's
written

01:56:25.370 --> 01:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:56:31.609 --> 01:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.619 --> 01:56:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:56:33.590 --> 01:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
was made aware of a problem with the
 
01:56:37.129 --> 01:56:37.139 align:start position:0%
Tipping law
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
seven or eight years ago
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
now Senator Murphy and I sat down at
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
this bar
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
with another representative and had a
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
couple beers and figured this out
 
01:56:49.729 --> 01:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
because a local large local
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
establishment had been fined by the
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor for having one of
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
those buckets or spittoons behind the
 
01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:57.350 align:start position:0%
those buckets or spittoons behind the
bar

01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
bar
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
um and they would put all their tips in
 
01:56:58.860 --> 01:56:59.629 align:start position:0%
um and they would put all their tips in
there

01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:57:01.450 --> 01:57:01.460 align:start position:0%
and then they would spread them out
 
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
amongst the bartenders and some of the
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
hostesses or waitresses at the end of
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
the night
 
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
and that was against the law that was
 
01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
not allowed in the state of New
 
01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we found in reviewing the
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
Tipping law there were still laws about
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
pin boys anyone know what a pin boy is
 
01:57:19.729 --> 01:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
the guys that used to put up the bowling
 
01:57:19.739 --> 01:57:21.169 align:start position:0%
the guys that used to put up the bowling
pins

01:57:21.169 --> 01:57:21.179 align:start position:0%
pins
 
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
before there was electronic bowling pins
 
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
and and there was laws and we saw in the
 
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
books about how much you could tip
 
01:57:29.089 --> 01:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
someone to Pursuit you in a certain
 
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
place in a movie theater
 
01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
so going back number of years so we met
 
01:57:34.250 --> 01:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
at these things and everyone seemed to
 
01:57:36.109 --> 01:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
like it for a while uh I think it's been
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
seven or eight years and they like the
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
the uh the plan
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh now we have a little tweak to it I
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
fully believe as I think everyone if I
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
can impart only one thing on this
 
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
committee ever
 
01:57:50.689 --> 01:57:50.699 align:start position:0%
number one
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
is the tips are the money of the
 
01:57:54.119 --> 01:57:55.669 align:start position:0%
is the tips are the money of the
employees

01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:57:59.450 --> 01:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
no ifs ands or buts about it
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
we should always be careful to protect
 
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
the employees and those tips
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
from owners
 
01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's not theirs
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
never has been never should be
 
01:58:14.689 --> 01:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
someone brought to me a a company that
 
01:58:15.890 --> 01:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to come in here and open a bunch
 
01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
of restaurants they called me up and
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
said we'd like to have lunch with you
 
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
and see if we can uh the management
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
wants to control what happens with the
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
tips I said sorry we're not even going
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
to have lunch
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen in the New
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the clarification and
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not against future clarification but
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like that clarification to be worked
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
out with
 
01:58:39.850 --> 01:58:39.860 align:start position:0%
um with the the
 
01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
association parties that are involved
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
so I will support this but please
 
01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
recommend that I think I would like all
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
of my Republican members to to I think
 
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
they all agree with me and I know my
 
01:58:58.250 --> 01:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%

front of this committee
 
02:00:20.089 --> 02:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
um a few things we have to do
 
02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
um representative Sullivan and I have
 
02:00:25.129 --> 02:00:25.139 align:start position:0%
already been talking about and I'm going
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
to start them pretty soon like the next
 
02:00:28.250 --> 02:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
couple weeks we're going to try to set a
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
schedule up to start talking about the
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
retained bills I don't want these to sit
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
around until October and then we kind of
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
rush through them we have two or three
 
02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
very complex bills
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
um representative Sullivan I have come
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
to a agreement to disagree on one aspect
 
02:00:46.089 --> 02:00:46.099 align:start position:0%
of one which we will try to work through
 
02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh and the other ones so I am going to
 
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
ask I will be contacting some of you for
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
volunteers I'd like a few more people on
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
some of these committees I understand we
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
only had a couple people on these
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittees before but I'm going to
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
want a few more people involved if they
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
can I don't want anyone to be on more
 
02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
than one if they don't have to I respect
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
um the time frame representative
 
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
Sullivan how long do you think we have
 
02:01:12.169 --> 02:01:12.179 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
I think it
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
you and I had this conversation and um
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
you speculated that the speaker might
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
allow meetings during July and August
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
that wasn't allowed last year and that
 
02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:30.179 align:start position:0%
kind of cramped our style
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
frankly if we could squeeze it all into
 
02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:38.030 align:start position:0%
frankly if we could squeeze it all into
June

02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
June
 
02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:38.689 align:start position:0%
June
um

02:01:38.689 --> 02:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would be if we could get as much as
 
02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
possible done in June and then maybe
 
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
having a meeting or two later
 
02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
um I I also want to have some respect
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
for people's summertime
 
02:01:54.290 --> 02:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
um you know we've all been at it January
 
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
through June
 
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
um it might be nice to have some time
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
off in July and August so if we sprinkle
 
02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
meetings throughout July and August we
 
02:02:08.209 --> 02:02:08.219 align:start position:0%
we can spoil people's opportunity to get
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
out travel and do something with family
 
02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:10.970 align:start position:0%
out travel and do something with family
or

02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:12.770 align:start position:0%
or
Alone

02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
Alone
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
um we have four
 
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
four we have three
 
02:02:20.689 --> 02:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
we have one sure we have turkot yeah I
 
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
don't think that's going well right OSHA
 
02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
yep and marijuana medical marijuana yep
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
I thought there was one more there's
 
02:02:29.209 --> 02:02:29.219 align:start position:0%
three years there's one more
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.770 --> 02:02:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
discharge volunteer oh that's that's it
 
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
that's the one that's it because I want
 
02:02:55.689 --> 02:02:55.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.209 --> 02:02:59.219 align:start position:0%
right so there's four
 
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
um but I think we need to work need
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
working at least two yeah I agree
 
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to yank people up here
 
02:03:10.370 --> 02:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
we're going to see do uh okay first of
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
all Brian and I in the in the chairs
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
meeting chair and vice chair meeting
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
there was indication that they were
 
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
going to allow because we had so many
 
02:03:20.930 --> 02:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
retained bills especially like Commerce
 
02:03:22.189 --> 02:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
Commerce didn't want to have any ten
 
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
tens so they have 25 retained bills and
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
so they're going to need the summer to
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
do that okay so I do believe the speaker
 
02:03:31.609 --> 02:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
will allow that was that the same
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
indication you you got from that meet
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
from some of those discussions my
 
02:03:36.179 --> 02:03:37.609 align:start position:0%
from some of those discussions my
meeting

02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
way earlier than yours and the way I
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
understood it is what the speaker was
 
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
allowing was work before the summer
 
02:03:46.729 --> 02:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
which in some years they do not allow
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
you to even start on retained bills
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
until after the Summer's over and this
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
year he will allow once the meeting
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
rooms are freed up with Senate bills we
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
can start in June
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but I did not hear that he I think I
 
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
thought that he was still discouraging
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
the July and August what I would like to
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
do representative Sullivan is to have at
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
least one hearing for each of them in
 
02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
June let's get to the point where we
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
know what we agree on
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
okay and there's a couple things that we
 
02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
don't agree on that we can at least see
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
if we can work on
 
02:04:21.649 --> 02:04:21.659 align:start position:0%
during the summer uh you know we don't
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
have to yeah I think if we have one
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
meeting in early in in June as we can
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
manage then we can figure out exactly
 
02:04:32.890 --> 02:04:32.900 align:start position:0%
where we stand with uh the speakers uh
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
allowances and uh and then we can use
 
02:04:38.089 --> 02:04:38.099 align:start position:0%

office

02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
what they think the next three Thursdays
 
02:05:08.689 --> 02:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
are going to be like because Anthony you
 
02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:10.139 align:start position:0%

scuttlebutt how many bills we have left
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
I thought the next three were all
 
02:05:22.490 --> 02:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
deadline dates at various types of
 
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:23.930 align:start position:0%
deadline dates at various types of
deadlines

02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
02:05:26.089 --> 02:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
right but I mean are we gonna have full
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
days ready for some of these things
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
right now we got to sit around and wait
 
02:05:29.570 --> 02:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
for the budget
 
02:05:32.209 --> 02:05:32.219 align:start position:0%
okay and and then everyone's kind of
 
02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
putting all kinds of amendments on each
 
02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
other's bills on either side you know
 
02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
and then the marijuana thing showed up
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday and or whatever so all these
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
different things but if if we're not
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
going to have if we're gonna have a
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
house session next Thursday and the
 
02:05:45.050 --> 02:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
Thursday after they don't have enough
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
because they're waiting
 
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
um then I'm going to schedule it on
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
something like that no I don't think
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'll have him on Thursday
 
02:05:52.970 --> 02:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
I don't think we'll have one this
 
02:05:55.010 --> 02:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
Thursday no because it's Memorial Day we
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
could sort of a tradition okay
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
we have had communities meet during that
 
02:06:01.370 --> 02:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
we've been told that the next uh meeting
 
02:06:03.550 --> 02:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
is the eighth yeah
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
so okay but I'll I'll find out
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
afterwards if they're going to have one
 
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
the next week after that
 
02:06:13.250 --> 02:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
what they're thinking of this is
 
02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
the three that he announced and I think
 
02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh representative proud is correct that
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
these are all deadlines so there will be
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
sessions it is a question of which ones
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
might be long and which might be short
 
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
but right
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna try to find out because if
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%

hours we do most concurrences and
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%

02:06:40.250 --> 02:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
