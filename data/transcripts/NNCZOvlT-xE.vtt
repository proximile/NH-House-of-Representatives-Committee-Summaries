uh everybody in the room uh I'm gonna
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
call the meeting to order if you'd like
 
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
to continue conversations I just ask
 
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
that you take them briefly outside
 
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
um otherwise if we could get everybody's
 
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you so much everybody it's good to
 
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
all right so we have four bills to look
 
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
at and we are dealing with early bills
 
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
um so our time frame is a little bit
 
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
constricted I'm going to start with HP
 
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.590 align:start position:0%
constricted I'm going to start with HP
250.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
250.
 
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
I could
 
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
um and just open it up to to people on
 
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee as to whether or not
 
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
you have questions that you feel like
 
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
haven't been answered that you need uh
 
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
information on in order to make a good
 
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
decision on that particular bill
 
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.650 align:start position:0%
decision on that particular bill
foreign

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chair
 
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.910 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chair
um

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
I know in the uh
 
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the revised uh the physical note 125
 
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.949 align:start position:0%
in the revised uh the physical note 125
23.

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 align:start position:0%
23.
 
00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
23.
um

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's stated at the bottom uh it should
 
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
be noted the physical impact of this
 
00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
bill will go well beyond uh 2026.
 
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
a million dollars a year
 
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.210 align:start position:0%
a million dollars a year
um

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.369 align:start position:0%
um
continuing

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
every year well what would be
 
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
the physical impact well beyond 2026. so
 
00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that that figure would
 
00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.009 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that that figure would
mean

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
Marty do you have any information on
 
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:15.530 align:start position:0%
Marty do you have any information on
that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record uh
 
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin from nhrs uh in reference
 
00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
to uh Representatives question there
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's two components to to two two
 
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
parts to the to the answer
 
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
um any um identified unfunded liability
 
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
associated with the bill for prior
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
benefit accruals that haven't been
 
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
funded that that's going to be paid off
 
00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 align:start position:0%
over a um
 
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
20-year close period beginning in fiscal
 
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
26 that's the next raid setting
 
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
valuation and FY 23 will set the rates
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
beginning in 26. so that unfunded
 
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
piece associated with that would would
 
00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
be paid down over 20 years there is and
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
I don't have a breakdown from the
 
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
actuary on that you know there is an
 
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
ongoing normal cost component to that
 
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0%
refunding that benefit before it's
 
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
accrued so um you know so you know that
 
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
it won't be that amount forever the the
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
you know the one million or the four
 
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
million uh the you know some fraction of
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a permanent addition
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
to the uh group two rates but uh the
 
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
unfunded piece is gonna get it's
 
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt thank you Mr
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
chairman so Marty uh you know we we've
 
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
seen uh analogous bills anyway uh uh
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
over the years that wanted to tap into
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
the the system uh and one of the reasons
 
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 align:start position:0%
that we were
 
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
reluctant to get involved in that
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
previously was in each case we were
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to be kicking ourselves backwards
 
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
in terms of getting out from underneath
 
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
the ual right and is this it is
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
analogous or it is the same situation
 
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
we're just better off now
 
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
well if if you're you're making uh
 
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
benefit changes that would have some
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
aspect of unfunded it you know it does
 
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
add to the cost but you have to weigh
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
the the policy consideration of of does
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
this make sense from a you know a a
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
policy perspective and that that's
 
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
something we wouldn't a pine on you know
 
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
does you know is this
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know in in the view of this
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
committee does this um legislation right
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
a wrong or correct something in the
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
right in the in the statute that should
 
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
be changed but but that's I'm not
 
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
getting at that aspect I'm getting at
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
the aspect of whether we're pushing
 
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
ourselves backwards in terms of getting
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
out from underneath okay in general
 
00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 align:start position:0%
terms anytime you're
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
modifying benefits on the on the
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
increased side you know there's going to
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
be an unfunded piece to that unless it's
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
um future hires and you're adding that
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know we do have the statutory
 
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
layered amortization to pay that down so
 
00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
it's more manageable than it was 10
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
years ago when it was sort of a blank
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
check rolling forever you know there's a
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's more of a window to
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
pay these down now the way the statute
 
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
is structured I mean at the time we were
 
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
paying basically just interest we
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
weren't drawing down the uaal we were we
 
00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
were just paying interest yeah so we're
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
just adding to our interest costs so
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
this is a we are in a better situation
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
Marty um oh one second I'll get right to
 
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.969 align:start position:0%
Marty um oh one second I'll get right to
you

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 align:start position:0%
um this is a situation and I have to
 
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
apologize I wasn't here for the public
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
um this is a situation if somebody
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
reaches retirement age uh their
 
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse gets 100 of the benefit
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh this is a
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
active uh accidental death benefit right
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah um so comparatively to the uh
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
working and who who is killed you know
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know in a work related death
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
um you know while still an active member
 
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
um beneficiary or the spouse would get
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
100 instead of 50 of their their pension
 
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
as calculated on the on the day they
 
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
passed right but if they reached
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
retirement age uh and then they passed
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
their spouse would have access to 100 of
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
the of the benefit for accidental death
 
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
that that is um
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
any um no no I understand The Accidental
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I'm not being clear I'm
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
saying they don't die before they retire
 
00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259 align:start position:0%
they actually reach retirement age they
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
start getting their pension and then
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
after that they die does the surviving
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
spouse receive 100 of the benefit oh
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry representative when
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
someone retires they can designate a
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
survivorship option on their retirement
 
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
application and leave 50 or 100 or some
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
other amount to a designated beneficiary
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be a spouse many
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
people choose that if they're in that
 
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
sort of relationship
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
um in that that this bill wouldn't
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
change the benefits for any of those
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
folks those that's a separate
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
designation as part of the retirement
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
process this is a pre-retirement uh
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
death benefit so just so I can be clear
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
at the point I'm trying to get at
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
somebody reaches retirement age
 
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
starts collecting their benefit passes
 
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.129 align:start position:0%
starts collecting their benefit passes
away

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
their spout they can give up to 100 of
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
the benefit to a Survivor they die in
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
the line of duty three weeks before they
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
reach retirement age
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
they only have access to 50 am I
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly I'm just
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that my head's
 
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
wrapped around this
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
um yeah basically you know it's if it's
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
an active death that there are different
 
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
statutory Provisions that cover that and
 
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:42.740 align:start position:0%
and right now that that active
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
accidental is what it's referred to in
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
the statute death benefit is uh 50 of
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
the pension to the surviving spouse or
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
if there's no spouse this contingent for
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
if there's dependent parents or children
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
um if if they did not have a spouse the
 
00:08:59.410 --> 00:08:59.420 align:start position:0%
Alum sum would be paid to a beneficiary
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
of accumulated contributions plus salary
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
so so it is it's this this would this
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
bill would change the structure of that
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh active death benefit but not not
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
anything for anybody who's retired or
 
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
anything like that yeah you know they
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
have they have their own choices to make
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
on those survivorship options and those
 
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
would remain in Force if they passed
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
away after retirement I think
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
do you have somebody filling out the
 
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.250 align:start position:0%
do you have somebody filling out the
sheets

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
I haven't been for this these bills oh
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
just a clarification on the question you
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
just asked so Marty correctly if I'm
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
wrong but I believe
 
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
um you know if they're gonna especially
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
if they've retired and they want to
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
specify a uh Survivor benefit whether
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's 100 50 or more whatever they're
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
actually paying for that because they're
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
going to get a reduced benefit is that
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah so we're not paying
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
for it our the other retirees they are
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense thank you
 
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:03.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
initially was a little bit concerned
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
because I had to miss a couple of bills
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
as well when I was in another committee
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
testifying on some of my own legislation
 
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.490 align:start position:0%
testifying on some of my own legislation
but

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.170 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:14.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
coming back I am I I'm sure I heard this
 
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
bill so what we're talking about though
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
is not uh an ordinary sort of outcome
 
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:27.740 align:start position:0%
it's it's only involves accidental
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
deaths and we had we've had numerous
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
bills over the years that have in a
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
provided death benefits
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
and as I recall we were looking at the
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
cost of doing it through insurance and
 
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
we determined that the
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
likelihood of any of these incidents
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
occurring was sufficiently small that we
 
00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:53.459 align:start position:0%
were better off paying it out of the
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
general fund than incurring the cost of
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
of the insurance that might never be
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's like an accident you never have in
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
this particular situation there's some
 
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
kind of statistical
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh probability calculation that you do
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
what is the likelihood of an accidental
 
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
death based on you know all the other
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
factors that are involved is that not
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
the case that's the case that that
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
analysis of you know buying you know
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
spot Market insurance for you know death
 
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
and disability versus including you know
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
the plan was conducted before I got here
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
but what you just said was my
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
recollection of the record that I read
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure you know somewhere in
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
the 2000s or
 
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
have any questions that they really feel
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
like they need clarification yes
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question I don't know I don't
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
know if you have the the original
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
physical note
 
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
I I don't have it with me
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
um the only difference in the fiscal
 
00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:58.019 align:start position:0%
note though would have been initially
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
um you know the accurate was projecting
 
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
what the cost would be beginning in the
 
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
24-25 biennium and we noticed that and
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
and pointed out well we're not going to
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
recertify those rates those have already
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
been presented to the employers into the
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
state you know so we you know when
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
they're far along in their budgeting
 
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
processes for for the next fiscal year
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
so we asked them to restart re issue the
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
notes basically showing the cost
 
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
beginning to show up in 2627 but the
 
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
analysis it's underlying analysis didn't
 
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
change they just so so my question is
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the original physical
 
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
note it's talking about 2024 uh for the
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions one million
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
dollars and in 2025
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
another million dollars in 2026 another
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars monthly roughly but in
 
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
the revised it just has starting up
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
in 2026
 
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
above roughly a million dollars so where
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
did that other two million dollars go
 
00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:57.410 align:start position:0%
did that other two million dollars go
it

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
basically that you know the the payoff
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
of of any unfunded piece of this and any
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
any uh future accruals is going to show
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
up in the 26-27 rate so it's you know if
 
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.430 align:start position:0%
up in the 26-27 rate so it's you know if
if

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
um this was
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
if we if this was last year and we
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
hadn't done the 24 25 rates because that
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
would have been based on the 21
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
Actuarial report
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
um it would show up in 24 25 in the
 
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
20-year layer in which the the change
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
was going to be recognized would be
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
would go you know 24 to 43
 
00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
um but so it's going to be 26 to 45
 
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
those 20 years
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so so the you know that you know it
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
the the money hasn't gone away it just
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
add two years to the end of the
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
20 years rather than starting in 24 and
 
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
ending 20 years from now we're going to
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:50.459 align:start position:0%
so how nervous would be the increase in
 
00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:51.350 align:start position:0%
so how nervous would be the increase in
rates

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
to employers it's it's a it's you know
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
that those amounts are
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
fractional in the you know the you know
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
tenths of the basis point
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
um on you know you know point you know
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
zero X you know it may
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
have that here
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
um I didn't get the other fiscal note in
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
time to print one and bring it but it
 
00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%
you know that you know uh you know one
 
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
million uh is is a small amount the the
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
employers paid 620 Million last year so
 
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's less than 1 620th you know
 
00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:29.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
does the committee feel like it has a
 
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I feel like it has adequate
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
information to
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
discuss the bill
 
00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.410 align:start position:0%
discuss the bill
yes

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
no he's not on the subcommittee no he's
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
just here to to listen in and maybe say

um all right
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a strong enough
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
feeling to make a motion on this
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes um representative I know
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
no he's not Oh I thought he was no no
 
00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:12.710 align:start position:0%
no he's not Oh I thought he was no no
sorry

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:14.590 align:start position:0%
he's just helpful sometimes
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.189 align:start position:0%
he's just helpful sometimes
[Laughter]

00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
no it's uh representative Gerhard
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative Davis representative true
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and myself
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative true to make a comment
 
00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:28.370 align:start position:0%
representative true to make a comment
yes

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.870 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
just uh from where I am coming from
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at an unfunded liability
 
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
to the towns
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
and that's always uh very difficult
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
Mountain for me to climb because we're
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
not allowed to pass unfunded liabilities
 
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
constitutionally

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
 
00:15:54.839 --> 00:15:56.689 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
28-day

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
28-day
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
we can't pass unfunded liabilities to
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
the town I'm not sure that that yeah I'm
 
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
not sure that applies in this particular
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
situation representative true otherwise
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
the entire system would be
 
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.970 align:start position:0%
the entire system would be
unconstitutional

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
it has to be something new
 
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.110 align:start position:0%
it has to be something new
right

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
A continuing situation it's not the same
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
as something new right
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
you're imposing a new expenditure a new
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
burden on a town without paying for it
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's 28a if you're continuing
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
something I'm quite sure that's not the
 
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.069 align:start position:0%
something I'm quite sure that's not the
case

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
so let's let's let's make sure we're
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly is there someone
 
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
officially that can uh speak to that Rd
 
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'm looking up but
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas can you shed some
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
light I'm I'm uh you're looking it up I
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
believe I have the constitution on my
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
phone usually try and do that
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
ten years but I mean the the point of
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
down of increasing expenses to
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities I think is perhaps the
 
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
main point that you're driving at even
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
more so than the unfunded or if it
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't an unfunded would you feel more
 
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.230 align:start position:0%
wasn't an unfunded would you feel more
comfortable

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'd feel more
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
comfortable if it was
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
if it was just then that's going to the
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
from the general fund but
 
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and I'm certainly not saying that the
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
whole pension system should collapse
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
because of unfunded liability right but
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
as the as the good representative
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out this is a new benefit
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
this is a new cost
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
it's not a new benefit it would be an
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
expansion of an existing benefit but I'm
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
I've got it here I'm not going to say
 
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
what what it means but it's brief so the
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
state shall not mandate or assign any
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
new expanded or modified programs or
 
00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:36.539 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to any political
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
subdivision in such a way as the
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
necessitate additional local
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
expenditures by the political
 
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
subdivision unless such programs or
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are fully funded by the
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
state or unless such programs or
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are approved for
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
funding by a vote of the local
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
legislative body of the political
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
subdivision and so it says new
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
Marty do you have any insight into that
 
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:12.010 align:start position:0%
Marty do you have any insight into that
yeah

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
I just feel like if that were the case
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:30.049 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
well we got clarification on whether it
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
is or it isn't
 
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.330 align:start position:0%
is or it isn't
um

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Brian did you want to say
 
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
something yeah I representative true
 
00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
brings up a very good point and if we
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
were to accept
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
you know his interpretation then
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
everything that was done since 1967 is
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
technically illegal
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
actually the effective date of the
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
amendment the Constitution was November
 
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:01.940 align:start position:0%
28 1984. it'll be after that
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
just to complicate it a little bit more
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
yeah since yeah right I'm not saying
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
whether or not what's right or wrong on
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
this I just was going to read it yeah no
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate that as well
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I just I mean we be it's either
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply here or we've been
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
breaking it left and right so for this
 
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
particular issue well some got broken
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
but you're right yeah well you know like
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
it's something definitely got broken
 
00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:28.490 align:start position:0%
it's something definitely got broken
um

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
but anyway uh once again does anybody on
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
the committee have a strong enough
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:40.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative Davis
 
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion about to pass okay I
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
have a recommendation of octopus to have
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
a second on that recommendation
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard recommends our
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
second still out to pass
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives okay
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
well I just say it's kind of arbitrary
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
if you die after a certain date you only
 
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
get half it just it's just the
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
arbitrariness of it that doesn't make
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
any sense to me
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
so all lives are equal right so
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to speak to it
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with the concept of the bill
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
the question I have is whether the the
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
question about 28a issue has been
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get clarification on that so
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
that we don't do something I I think
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
we just need to make sure we have a
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
legal opinion on it
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
so would you feel comfortable if we move
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
this out to pass but we find that out
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
before the general executive session of
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
I think it's a relatively simple
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
I think it's a relatively simple
 
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
question to uh look into and
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
representative goalie has just rejoined
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
you are but perhaps you that there's a
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
question as to whether or not making
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
adjustments in HRS uh would be an
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
infraction on
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
um downshifting expenses to
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities so if he extends if we
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
expand the death benefit
 
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
um it's obviously going to create
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
expenses for municipalities that the
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
state isn't covering does that break
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
because we're going to hear much larger
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations in a little bit than
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with here I would say
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
it doesn't we've done numerous changes
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
that have changed the rate of employers
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
and none of it that I'm aware of has
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
been ruled unconstitutional I mean
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
really every few years when they set the
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
new rate we're doing that if the rate
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
goes up or even if you change your
 
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
benefit right
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
okay yes representatively just just
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
briefly to uh representative Schmidt's
 
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
question the question is you know who
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
who can offer that opinion I mean uh you
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
know the extreme case the house could
 
00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
vote to ask an opinion of the Supreme
 
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
Court but there's certainly not time for
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
that other than that I mean the question
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
is who would be accepted as an authority
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
to rule on it otherwise and I don't know
 
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing heads shaking in the audience
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
so there there there are definitely
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
people who think that it's not a 28 ASU
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
and I think it's not a 28 issue but I'm
 
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer and I don't blame one on
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
television either so I'm not going to
 
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
opine about something but I'm not sure
 
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.450 align:start position:0%
opine about something but I'm not sure
about

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm willing to I'm willing to sit in
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
the position that we can comfortably
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
move forward on this without breaking
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
28. I mean that's that's my position on
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
it but representative true
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
um I think as Representatives we're all
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
responsible to uh to have our own
 
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
well-thought-out opinion of what the
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
Constitution says and what the
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
Constitution means
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
um this is new and expanded
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what the Constitution is
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
talking about in my opinion
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
um it is a unfunded liability to the
 
00:23:06.299 --> 00:23:08.210 align:start position:0%
um it is a unfunded liability to the
towns

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.350 align:start position:0%
towns
um

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
and with that opinion I could not
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
support the OTP thank you Marnie you had
 
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
something else you thought might be
 
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:22.270 align:start position:0%
something else you thought might be
helpful

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
right you know it doesn't answer the
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
historically there hasn't yet yeah it's
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
one of those strange situations where we
 
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
have a great deal to say about what
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
happens with the retirement system but
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
the expenses generally between the
 
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
employee and the employer which we're
 
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
frequently not that employer
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
um so I understand the confusion around
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
it but
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
like I said I think we'll move forward
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
with the assumption that it that it
 
00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
wouldn't break a 20-day and uh and I
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative true's
 
00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.590 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative true's
comments

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gerhard thank you
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to say I agree with
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative true I think it's a good
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
point being that we shouldn't need a
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
separate class of witch doctors to
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
interpret document that's supposed to
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
govern our activities and see if the
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
average person can't understand the
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution then we need to change it
 
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
and that's just how that makes sense to
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
me so anyway I agree with what he's
 
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.430 align:start position:0%
me so anyway I agree with what he's
saying

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
all right I guess I would just add to
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
the conversation for the amount of
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
expense that it looks like it would
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
accrue and the impact to the rate that
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
it would have seems to be pretty
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
diminutive at least according to
 
00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.450 align:start position:0%
diminutive at least according to
testimony

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
um it's not going to place a huge burden
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
um on the municipalities which I am also
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
very conscientious of and I appreciate
 
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059 align:start position:0%
that that thought
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
um but one of our when one of our own
 
00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
um but one of our when one of our own
dies

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
dies
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
serving Us in that capacity
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
um I think they they deserve our respect
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
um and and being taken care of at least
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
at least to this level
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to add that to the
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
conversation and uh with that I will
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
actually call the roll and the movement
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
um and I will start representative true
 
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.110 align:start position:0%
um and I will start representative true
nay

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
nay
 
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt yes
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart yes and the chair
 
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
votes yes so that's uh four four to one
 
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's possible pass that on to the
 
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:30.049 align:start position:0%
that's possible pass that on to the
committee

00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
um we'll bring up 571 next relative to
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of living adjustments per
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
certain group 2 retirees
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
this is our Cola increase spell
 
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.810 align:start position:0%
this is our Cola increase spell
um

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
any statements from members of the
 
00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:48.299 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or questions that you would
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
find helpful to have answered before you
 
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.669 align:start position:0%
find helpful to have answered before you
can

00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
talk about this one
 
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.210 align:start position:0%
talk about this one
intelligently

00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:58.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
that is isn't it
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
um as long as there's nobody from the
 
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.610 align:start position:0%
um as long as there's nobody from the
community

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%

lot of you may not know but there was a

gentleman a firefighter out of
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester that we used to call him
 
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.330 align:start position:0%
Manchester that we used to call him
timer

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:34.340 align:start position:0%
timer
 
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
and the gentleman uh I think he retired
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
God Only Knows particularly being the
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
firemen uh there's a lot of stuff that
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
happens to you uh according to the
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
National figures You Only Live basically
 
00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:51.419 align:start position:0%
you know 10 years after you retire but
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
timer Beat the Clock okay and he had a
 
00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:58.100 align:start position:0%
very long and healthy retirement
 
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the pension system at the
 
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
amount of paid at the city of Manchester
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
was paying that to particular time did
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
not keep up with his longevity okay so
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh what we have here is a system by the
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
state that does not have by a clock on
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
the regularity of putting a cola in okay
 
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
if you had a 401k per se once you retire
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
you make a decision on how much you
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
might want to pull out you know for a
 
00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:30.539 align:start position:0%
particular year or something like that
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
members of New Hampshire retirement
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
system are basically on a income with
 
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
the defined benefit program so it
 
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
depletes down and you're at the whim and
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
the good stead of the House of
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
Representatives in the Senate onto
 
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
whether you're going to receive a cost
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
of living increase so in the situation
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
timer he
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
basically lived to the point that he was
 
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
almost Indigent you know receiving very
 
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
little money and was very sad this is a
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
gentleman that had well over 20 plus
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
years of service to his particular
 
00:28:09.059 --> 00:28:10.450 align:start position:0%
years of service to his particular
community

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:10.460 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
and you know your trial ideas are
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
supposed to be your enjoyable ones you
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
know that's why you went through the you
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
know all the years are working and that
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't the case so in your consideration
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
of this bill I would like you to take
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
the story of time and to mind I'm not
 
00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
pulling out your hot strings or that
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
wasn't my intention you did though but
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
but the thing is it does have an impact
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
because this does not come out in a
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
timely basis it's from time to time it
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
comes up to whether we're going to
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
support the cola and I hope it's that
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
you recognize it's about time
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
that the retirees particularly the ones
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
that are mapped the standards of this
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
have been out there for a while and they
 
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
could definitely use this to increase
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
their quality of life in their Twilight
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
Years thank you thank you representative
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
O'Brien I think the thing that I'm
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
struggling with with this particular
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
bill is we do have a society in which
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
some people are on a direct benefit or
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
defined benefit and some are on defined
 
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.090 align:start position:0%
defined benefit and some are on defined
contribution

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
um and when I'm when I'm thinking about
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
giving a cost of living increase on a
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
retirement program
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
I have to recognize right up front that
 
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
not everybody gets that benefit and I
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
understand uh the comment that you made
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
about being able to draw if you're in a
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
direct contribution but along with that
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
comes the risk of losing everything if
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
your Investments are are bad and there
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
is no mechanism by which somebody who
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
finds them in that situation would
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
equally get a cost of living adjustment
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
to help them and so I'm although
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
obviously as I spoke before I have a
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
good deal of respect for people in group
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
two of our retirement system I also want
 
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
to be careful not to give them
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
advantages that everybody else in
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
society is going to pay for while at the
 
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
same time their own retirement benefits
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
may be dwindling because of the market
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
doing poorly or whatever the situation
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
may be we might find ourselves in a
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
situation where the Market's doing
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
partly they're losing benefit and then
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to pay additional
 
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.649 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to pay additional
money

00:30:14.649 --> 00:30:14.659 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
for this for this specific group so I'm
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
just a little bit cautious of of that
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes yes and I think the chair is well
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
founded to present that opinion too uh
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
but I think to chair and members of the
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
committee need to recognize that it's uh
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
not all oranges we're talking about it's
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
apples and oranges in this type of
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
situation uh the people that belong to
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire retirement system do
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
not pay social security
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
benefits so they don't uh really receive
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
that particular rate I know in myself
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
you know being retired any type of job
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
that I had on the outside that would
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
come in so I mean you're limited to a
 
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
scope you know there's the average
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
person so let's say they did have a 401k
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
or something like that does have an
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
entitlement to the Social Security this
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
does not exist for these particular
 
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.750 align:start position:0%
does not exist for these particular
people

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for that yes representative
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
Gerhard thank you chairman I'm just
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're not addressing the
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
bigger issue here I mean we have a
 
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
privately owned Central Bank that's
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
printing money like it's going out of
 
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
style and we're trying to keep up when
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
we never can I just you know what I mean
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's a much bigger issue at play and I
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
just kind of feel like we're
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
sidestepping the issue and just even if
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
we do give a cost of living adjustment
 
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
what if it hit inflation at 20 something
 
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
percent next year and you know what I
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
mean they just keep on going the way
 
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
they're going which seems like the way
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to go do we just play this
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
game again next year
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's see that's my concern is we're
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
kind of avoiding what's really going on
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
and just dealing with the subsidiary
 
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.110 align:start position:0%
and just dealing with the subsidiary
effects

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
effects
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
anybody else uh one second
 
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:48.380 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative true
 
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
do we have an FN on this I don't on my
 
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.690 align:start position:0%
do we have an FN on this I don't on my
paperwork

00:31:59.690 --> 00:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
this might have been one of the ones
 
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.149 align:start position:0%
this might have been one of the ones
that

00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
was coming
 
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:14.510 align:start position:0%
was coming
yes

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.889 align:start position:0%
 
outside

00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
outside
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
um I have a fiscal note on mine of 84
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
million in year 2023.
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
Marty is that sound correct
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brown thank you Mr
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
chair I know in my time being the uh
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and chair of Transportation
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
when we get into complex issues uh that
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
the chair can make a decision whether to
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
have uh you know somebody outside that's
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
more aversed into this to come up and uh
 
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
to be recognized and amongst us this
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon is a former member of this
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
committee that has had some a lot of
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
experience with this and that's
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
representative uh Steve Pearson so if
 
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to indulge my
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
request to allow representative Pearson
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
to maybe hit some club right we were
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
going to hear so much from
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson today I don't
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
know if I can deal with him on another
 
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:12.980 align:start position:0%
bill you know
 
00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
sympathize yeah well you know there's
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
only so much I can do representative
 
00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:19.220 align:start position:0%
Pearson welcome to the committee
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to really
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to uh
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to render opinion either
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
way on this I'm just going to give you
 
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
some background here right so we're
 
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
Regional competitive labor market that's
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
New England
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
there are six New England states five of
 
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
the six New England states by Statute
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
issue a cost of living adjustment
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
generally based on the CPI between one
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
and five percent as a minimum and a
 
00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:52.850 align:start position:0%
and five percent as a minimum and a
maximum

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
maximum
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
we are the only one that doesn't do that
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
and that's why these bills come before
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
this body is because we don't have an
 
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
automatic mechanism in place to deal
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
with that now as you've heard during the
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this because we don't
 
00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:09.899 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism to do this the state of
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is tremendously behind
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
when you look at the cost of living over
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
the last 25 years versus what's been
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
was stirred around here a second ago
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
involves 28a I've confirmed with the
 
00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee who has
 
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
extensive knowledge in the pension
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
system and I will bring up this one
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
point under 28a
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's a little line on there about
 
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.750 align:start position:0%
there's a little line on there about
consent

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
in 1967 the cities and towns consented
 
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
to be part of the New Hampshire
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
retirement system that part of the
 
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
Constitution has been fulfilled
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
so there is not a 28-day issue in any of
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
this this is a system that was mutually
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
entered into in 1967.
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we can we can put that to bed right
 
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
now aside from that there was a
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
substantial State commission the
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
decennial commission that occurred
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
and that commission was never
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
this was never challenged
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
I currently sit on the decennial
 
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
commission right now but um
 
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.150 align:start position:0%
commission right now but um
so

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
all I can all I can
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
request is caution
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
because if someone wants to go down that
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
road and reset the retirement system to
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
numbers of 1984.
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
I will be the first one in line to say
 
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.770 align:start position:0%
I will be the first one in line to say
yes

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's fair because the because frankly
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
the the way the system was calculated in
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
84 is far better and generous than it is
 
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.430 align:start position:0%
84 is far better and generous than it is
today

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
so but again just to just to offer
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
perspective on the cost of living which
 
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
is the bill in front of you right now
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
that that is what's going on regionally
 
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.089 align:start position:0%
that that is what's going on regionally
and

00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:53.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
you know in
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
until the state of New Hampshire adopts
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
something that's that's a little bit
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
um automatic
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
you guys are going to continuously see
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
these bills session after session after
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
session after session
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
so I won't make you speak to this
 
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
because it would probably be an awkward
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
thing to answer
 
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.450 align:start position:0%
thing to answer
um

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
we are going to have before us just in
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
these four bills some really high ticket
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
numbers I wasn't here in 2012 when this
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
whole thing kind of went sideways but
 
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
now I'm sitting here trying to at least
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
mitigate the damage of it going sideways
 
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
10 years ago and as part of that I have
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
to keep into consideration
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
if we if we pile on too much expense all
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
at once that it might all go down in
 
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.569 align:start position:0%
at once that it might all go down in
flames

00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:38.579 align:start position:0%
flames
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
um so part of my hesitancy in doing it
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
this year even if and I understand what
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
you're saying but part of my hesitancy
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
is I feel like we got a few bigger nuts
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
to crack this particular year and I'd
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
like to get some of those nuts through
 
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:52.140 align:start position:0%
before we sure
 
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
um you know before we think about taking
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
this one on as and I understand
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative Brian's arguments uh I
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
appreciate them
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
um but I think in this particular
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
situation right now where we sit
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of people out there who
 
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
are facing the same kind of situation
 
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
um a lot of fellow members of the State
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I'm just worried
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
that if we pile an extra 84 million
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
dollars onto the other things that might
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
be coming out of this committee that
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
it'll all just get shot
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
so like I said I was up here to to offer
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
you some historical perspective on this
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
in it as a policy
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I just ask that you take those cons
 
00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
you know those facts into account here
 
00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:33.410 align:start position:0%
you know those facts into account here
um

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:37.329 --> 00:37:37.339 align:start position:0%
and uh I had another thought but as a
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
self-diagnosed member with CRS it's
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
taken me a second here to come up with
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
that so I'll I'm sure we'll be talking
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
again shortly we'll be talking again
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
shortly thank you so much
 
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.170 align:start position:0%
shortly thank you so much
um

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
any further thoughts concerns from the
 
00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:52.250 align:start position:0%
any further thoughts concerns from the
committee

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
um and I thank the uh the representative
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
for giving his opinion on why it's not a
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
28 a issue
 
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.609 align:start position:0%
28 a issue
um

00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh he was actually giving the chair's
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.450 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I'll be saying the the words
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
28a quite a bit today that's fair
 
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
I'm a little I'm very concerned with the
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
84 million
 
00:38:26.099 --> 00:38:27.109 align:start position:0%
84 million
um

00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
I'm almost willing to uh to let Finance
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
deal with that
 
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
but the policy the policy of a cola for
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's a good policy
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
I don't get a cola on my pension I don't
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
know many people who get a cola on their
 
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh outside of state of the pension I
 
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
don't know that many people who get a
 
00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
pension anymore but
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
um the policy is what I object to on
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
did you want to make a motion on them
 
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.050 align:start position:0%
did you want to make a motion on them
uh

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
I would move uh on uh on this Ito
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
I have a motion of itl from
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative true would you like to
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
speak further to your motion
 
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.710 align:start position:0%
speak further to your motion
um

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
based basically what I just what I just
 
00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
got through saying is I I uh I have a
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
problem with the policy
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
irregardless of if that's even the word
 
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
I think I think it is but what other
 
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
states do I'm not concerned with what
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
other states are doing
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's a good policy to
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
have uh uh
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
a cola assigned to uh to the retirement
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
bed thank you I I actually I agree with
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
you on that particular issue and I once
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
again further say
 
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.190 align:start position:0%
again further say
um

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
just from a financial standpoint we have
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
I think larger nuts to crack
 
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:15.890 align:start position:0%
I think larger nuts to crack
um

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
coming out of the committee subcommittee
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
today and uh I'd like to prioritize
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
those at this particular Point
 
00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:23.569 align:start position:0%
those at this particular Point
personally

00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
personally
 
00:40:23.579 --> 00:40:24.349 align:start position:0%
personally
um

00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
as important as this issue is so I will
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
call out a vote on that representative
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
true uh to pass representative yay
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
representative Davis nay
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:40:39.839 --> 00:40:41.210 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
hey

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
no sorry itl it was itl and that was my
 
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.270 align:start position:0%
no sorry itl it was itl and that was my
mistake

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry about that
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
so three names in two years all right so
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
we'll go around on this one again but
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
I'll come back to it yep
 
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move on to 436 because it's
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
a pretty big one and and this is one I'm
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
actually going to start off by having
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.569 --> 00:41:17.579 align:start position:0%
well it's it's pretty simple
 
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:18.810 align:start position:0%
um it's not complicated at all
 
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:28.550 align:start position:0%
um it's not complicated at all
[Laughter]

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
right you guys just take five minutes
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.200 --> 00:43:41.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
I am do you have everybody back uh we do
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
have everybody here and uh you have the
 
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.530 align:start position:0%
have everybody here and uh you have the
floor

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't have a copy of 436 in
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
front of me right now but it's kind of
 
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
really irrelevant because this is a
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
rewrite a potential rewrite Amendment
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
so to give you a little bit of
 
00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.750 align:start position:0%
so to give you a little bit of
background

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
um since we're since we've been talking
 
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
about the Constitution a little bit here
 
00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.750 align:start position:0%
about the Constitution a little bit here
in

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
2011 the decennial commission
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
met as
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as Most states were
 
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
meeting at that time the
 
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
the alarm was sounded of State debt in
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
reference to pension systems and all 50
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
states looked at this you know their
 
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.930 align:start position:0%
states looked at this you know their
circumstances

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire we formed
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
a commission to look at
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
what was going on and you know how do we
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
rein this in how do we
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
make changes to
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
not only stop the the hemorrhaging of of
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
formula but how do we repair it
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
so the decennial commission met it was a
 
00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
lengthy process there was a zillion
 
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
people on it there are people in this
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
room that sat in on those hearings a
 
00:44:58.569 --> 00:44:58.579 align:start position:0%
decade ago
 
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
which is what commissions do
 
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
but in this particular case
 
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report of the commission
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
was weaponized
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that's the only really way to
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
explain it
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
in legislation that was filed
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
under the guise of the decennial
 
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.650 align:start position:0%
under the guise of the decennial
commission

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
that started a ball rolling
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
that forecasters folks that understand
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
our competitive Regional labor market
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
looked at and said you are about to
 
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
create a tremendous problem
 
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
and those warnings were mostly ignored
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
so fast forward to 2021
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
not only did those
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
warnings hold to be true they're
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
actually worse than what was even
 
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.069 align:start position:0%
actually worse than what was even
forecasted

00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
forecasted
 
00:46:02.569 --> 00:46:02.579 align:start position:0%
so the Constitution State New Hampshire
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
article 23 is very clear it says you
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
shall not make retroactive law
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
what was passed in 2011 was retroactive
 
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.309 align:start position:0%
what was passed in 2011 was retroactive
law

00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
plain and simple
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
so in order to
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
repair that unconstitutional Act
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
I have before you that exact thing
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
now imagine my surprise getting an email
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
from the speaker's office summoning me
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
to see the speaker
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
for those of you that have ever been
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
sent to the principal's office and you
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
know what that feels like
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
uh when the Speaker of the House of
 
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
Representatives does that it's a little
 
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.190 align:start position:0%
Representatives does that it's a little
bit worse

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
the Speaker of the House said to me what
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
the heck is going on and I explained to
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
him what was going on and I was tasked
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
with a simple thing
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
how do we fix this
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
and can you do it
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
what do you say to the Speaker of the
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
House you say yes I can and I will so I
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
spent three and a half weeks some of it
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
involving sleep and uh came up with a
 
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
in a phase-in approach
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative trottier filed a bill to
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
do it in one shot kind of a bomb out of
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
an airplane here
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
we know what that the fiscal note on
 
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
that was it's not doable we can't do
 
00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:29.339 align:start position:0%
this in one shot it's not possible
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
the the budget of the State of New
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is just not large enough to
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
pull that off so
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
but can we do it in phases and I believe
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
and that's what's before you so
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'll go through this real quick a lot of
 
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.670 align:start position:0%
I'll go through this real quick a lot of
it's

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
shockingly simple despite all the Roman
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
numerals but
 
00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:50.750 align:start position:0%
numerals but
um

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I broke it down on the first page
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
section by section for you in outline
 
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.569 align:start position:0%
section by section for you in outline
form

00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:47:59.050 --> 00:47:59.060 align:start position:0%
just so that that would be
 
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
explainable easily the one thing you're
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
not going to see in here
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
uh is the first one 21 chapter 21 of
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
state law involves state employees in a
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy that was or it's not a
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
subsidy it's a medical program that's
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
been in there in law for quite a long
 
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
time that involves state folks it's not
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
under the guise of the retirement system
 
00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
but because there is a section in there
 
00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
that references RSA 100a it must be
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
modified we can't have contradictions in
 
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.470 align:start position:0%
modified we can't have contradictions in
law

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the only reason that that
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
particular part
 
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
you know part 21 of the rsas is is
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's just because it has to be
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
you can't we would end up with a
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
reference to something that doesn't
 
00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:40.550 align:start position:0%
reference to something that doesn't
exist

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
so if you flip to the next page the
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
first thing on here
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
and this is discussions with the chair
 
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.170 align:start position:0%
and this is discussions with the chair
um

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is this is in reference to honestly
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
a request that came out of a Court
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
ruling 10 years ago
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
the term vested in the state of New
 
00:48:58.490 --> 00:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has no legal definition there
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
are references to qualifications of a
 
00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
benefit in 100a
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
but the term vested as we would think it
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
as private corporations think it doesn't
 
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
exist and
 
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.569 align:start position:0%
exist and
so

00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
when the speaker
 
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
someone renewed was office I got
 
00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:20.579 align:start position:0%
representative Simon was there the chair
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire was there
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we talked about
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
afterwards was fixing a couple of other
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
things that really need to be in in
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
Statute in the definition of vested was
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
one of them so the proposed definition
 
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
of vested
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
is that it shall mean a members
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
qualified for a benefit upon 10 years
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
we've always presumed that that's the
 
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
way the retirement system calculates
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal costs
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
it's the way we've always just kind of
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
Presumed to work so the fiscal note on
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
this is nothing
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
because we're already doing it
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
but what it does is it codifies it into
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
law so that there's no ambiguity as to
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
really what that means
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
the second part of this sentence the
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
calculation of and those two references
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
involve the way your pensions calculated
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
cannot be reduced after three years of
 
00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
service that I will qualify under damage
 
00:50:11.579 --> 00:50:13.069 align:start position:0%
service that I will qualify under damage
control

00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
right now in New England New Hampshire
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
has a horrible reputation
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
that the state cannot be trusted
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
to to do anything
 
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
and frankly based on past things that
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
we've done that's justifiably so
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
so what this would do is it would say
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
after three years of service your
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
calculation cannot be reduced that
 
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
provides some stability it improves our
 
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.470 align:start position:0%
provides some stability it improves our
credibility

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
credibility
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
and it just makes it where look you know
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
what I know what's going on you know
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
they're not going to make this any worse
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
now normally you would think that'd be a
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
given but
 
00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
this will help repair some of that
 
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.970 align:start position:0%
this will help repair some of that
confidence

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
the next part The Honorable compensation
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
part the reason that you're going to see
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
that one change and I did it in bold as
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be consistent with how OLS
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
does things is that earnable
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
compensation right now is just a single
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
paragraph that encompasses both group
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
one and group two
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to make any sort of
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
an effective change
 
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
to one group you have to separate it out
 
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
that's all this does it takes that and
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
just separates group one and group two
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
so you go from
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
paragraphs A and B to adding C and D
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
verbatim language with the exception
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
that the group two part removes the
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
references out of the college teaching
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
system which does not they're not group
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
two people so there's no reason to have
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
it in there
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
the part that I struck out in group one
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
on the on the next page here and B
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
that language is redundant it's very
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
peculiar to see in statute the request
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
to do something in the next paragraph
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
the next paragraph tells you to do it so
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
it was a redundancy it's a language
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
cleanup thing it affects it makes no
 
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.290 align:start position:0%
cleanup thing it affects it makes no
change

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.099 align:start position:0%
and as you're as you guys are aware
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
especially those of you've been on the
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
committee for more than a term the
 
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
pension system is so complicated that
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
they publish their own book
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
you know what other RSA gets its own
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
book you know so this is just another
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
attempt to simplify things a little bit
 
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
and that again so Group C and D
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
it's verbatim language
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the plan and I'll
 
00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
get into the plan as as we go here
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing if you flip to the
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
next page the definition of average
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
final compensation same idea we've got
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
to separate group one and group two out
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
if we're going to make an effective
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
change to one group or another
 
00:52:59.089 --> 00:52:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.099 --> 00:53:00.530 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
the following page in paragraph to the
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
removal of and who have not attained
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
vested status prior to January 1 of 12.
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
if you really look at that and you
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
commence service in July of 11 that's
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
six months later
 
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
you will have to impress me tremendously
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
to become vested in six months I don't
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
care how much time you buy so it's a
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
little bit it's a little more gobbley
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
goo really in this thing you know we had
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
a change July 1 of 11 if that is the
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
Line in the Sand let's just clarify it
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
when you get to 185 you will start to
 
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
see where the transition plan comes into
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
effect that's why 2012 is removed and
 
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:48.059 align:start position:0%
replaced with 2013.
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's the only change in there until we
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
get to the the chart
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
and it's consistent throughout
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
in paragraph d
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
this is this is one of the biggest bones
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
of contention here so when
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
they decided to make retroactive changes
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
they did it
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
in a phased way
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
based on how much damage they wanted to
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
based on the number of years you had
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
already served
 
00:54:24.049 --> 00:54:24.059 align:start position:0%
and they did it into two-year chunks
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
what's in bold here is the the taking a
 
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
chart that has two-year categories and
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
just expands it into one-year categories
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
with no change it just blows it up from
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
so in order to make in order to
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
transition people over annually
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
if you were to not do that you would you
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
would ask some people to do one thing
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
and ask someone else to do something
 
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:53.930 align:start position:0%
and ask someone else to do something
else

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
because of the duration of time they had
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
been in service so that's why the chart
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
expands out
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Pearson can you
 
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
just say that again sure so
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
I don't have a cut in in its current
 
00:55:07.079 --> 00:55:08.270 align:start position:0%
I don't have a cut in in its current
form

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
it's eight to ten right six to eight
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
four to six and then less than four four
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
categories so by moving it out into ten
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
when you if the idea here is to annually
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
move people back into what they were
 
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.870 align:start position:0%
move people back into what they were
promised

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
promised
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
in one one year at a time
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
I can't do that if if your category is
 
00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
eight to ten I move one of you
 
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
one year and then I really move one of
 
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
you two years and that's so it to be
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
consistent across the board that's why
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
the charge yeah that makes sense yeah
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
does it make sense okay
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
now one of the things that's in here is
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
there are I would call them there's a
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
couple of concessions that are in here
 
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
because as I tell people you kind of you
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
have to satisfy two ladies in the room
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
you have to satisfy a fiscal part and
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
you have to satisfy a political part
 
00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:02.579 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns
 
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
that comes up is the rare occasion of
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
someone who has an outrageous pension
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
I don't find outrageous pensions to be
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the public interest they're not
 
00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
certainly in the interest of the health
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
and frankly those that have found ways
 
00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
in the past to manipulate this system
 
00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
have done damage to the rest of us
 
00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.930 align:start position:0%
have done damage to the rest of us
frankly

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
so in 2009 the the legislature put in a
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
the concession here is that to return
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
people back
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
into the the calculation and formula
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
that they agreed to when they took their
 
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.190 align:start position:0%
that they agreed to when they took their
position

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
the pension cap is going to have to kind
 
00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
of follow along with that so we don't
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
have those outrageous and they are rare
 
00:56:59.930 --> 00:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
and I want to stress that how rare they
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
are they truly are
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
but in order to satisfy a public The
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
public's concern on this and
 
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.130 align:start position:0%
public's concern on this and
prevent

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
a future problem
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
especially with the Optics
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
the pension cap will go back to 01.
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.329 --> 00:57:23.339 align:start position:0%
in that we have a problem
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
in our Cola World of not recognizing the
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
value of a dollar moving or the
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
devaluation of a dollar moving forward I
 
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:33.380 align:start position:0%
am proposing that the pension cap
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
annually increased by one and a quarter
 
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.890 align:start position:0%
annually increased by one and a quarter
percent

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
now keep in mind for every year you work
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
you get two and a half percent
 
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
so what this will not keep up with
 
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.630 align:start position:0%
so what this will not keep up with
inflation

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
because we all know there's no we're not
 
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
going to see one and a quarter percent
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
inflation for a long time but at least
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's moving the barometer here because
 
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
otherwise we get into these situations
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
where in 15 years we're going to have
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to be duking it out about
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
the fact that the pension cap doesn't
 
00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
and we need to adjust it and all that if
 
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
we can put a mechanism in place to
 
00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:11.339 align:start position:0%
handle that now it just takes care of
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
itself so this isn't just dealing with a
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
10-year transition this is dealing with
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
all new hires everybody moving forward
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
well yes the cap would exactly it just
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
it just puts a restriction 1.25 or
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
whatever correct okay yep now
 
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
let's look at some when we look at the
 
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
devaluation of a dollar in 2009 when the
 
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
pensacap was instituted at 120 000
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
dollars if you translate that into
 
00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:39.299 align:start position:0%
today's dollars at 38.6 percent
 
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
inflation for this region the pension
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
cap should be 166 thousand dollars
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
so this is a huge concession raising at
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
five grand and then starting that
 
00:58:51.299 --> 00:58:52.370 align:start position:0%
five grand and then starting that
process

00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.690 align:start position:0%
process
so

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
it was acceptable in 2009 to put it at
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
120 Grand let's compare apples to apples
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
here and and recognize that
 
00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
again from a from a policy standpoint
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
the general public is not going to view
 
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
166 thousand dollars as a pension that
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
that's going to kind of border on the
 
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
and that's the main gist of this now the
 
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
one other item that's included in here
 
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:22.789 align:start position:0%
one other item that's included in here
and

00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
we could potentially have retirement
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
the nhrs look at the look at this within
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
or without it at the in conversations
 
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
with the chair in the interest of
 
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.210 align:start position:0%
with the chair in the interest of
simplifying

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
simplifying
 
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
the request was made to remove the line
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
the lesser of 85 percent
 
00:59:43.609 --> 00:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
now imagine
 
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
it's 19. we'll go back to 1984 we we
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
threw that date out there when you used
 
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
to fill out your pension calculation
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
card it was a postcard it was what a lot
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the Republican Party think the IRS
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
should do for your income taxes a
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
postcard simple
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
so imagine today now you go through all
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
of this formulation and reductions and
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
twists and
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
hey what month did you start working so
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know depends on what you get you get
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
that all figured out
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
and then oh by the way at the end we're
 
01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
going to Lop 15 off
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to take it away and it's
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
like whoa hold on a second here you used
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to call the retirement system
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
and say hey this is what's going on with
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
me what do you think I'm gonna get those
 
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
were 15 minute phone calls now it's an
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
appointment it's an hour easily and
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
they're not even going to give you a
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
definitive answer it's going to be
 
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's going to kind of be this
 
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
so you already have enough trepidation
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
as it is going into retirement leaving
 
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
your profession wondering knowing that
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
this institution does not Grant colas
 
01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.150 align:start position:0%
this institution does not Grant colas
generally

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
I've got to come up with a dollar amount
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's going to work for me
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
not only for the next 10 years but
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
probably for the next 20. I might be a
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
little bit high on the first 10 but I
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
got to roll that through
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
because there's no Mecca mechanism in
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
place for me to have a cost of living
 
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
adjustment so in a defined benefit plan
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
if that is the opinion that it's a
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
defined benefit
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
these folks need to have a they need to
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
know that this is it and they've got to
 
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
make a plan and make a decision
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
so when you're sitting there trying to
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
figure it all out
 
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
and you get your mouth done and then
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to lob off 15 at the end
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
that's just slapping you in the face
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
this is the only part of this document
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
if we can make if if you guys want to
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
make a request with retirement to run
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
numbers both ways
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
with the 11 Line in the Sand that's fine
 
01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:47.030 align:start position:0%
with the 11 Line in the Sand that's fine
but

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
again this was an attempt to simplify
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
things in a conversation with the chair
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
of this committee and and myself
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
now if you flip that page that you're
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to get into what the legalese of
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
what this plan does
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
so it takes all that language
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
and says okay January 1 of 2025 we're
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
gonna do this
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
now why that date
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
and here's where the other concession
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
kicks in
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
right now if you are say hired
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
a month after these changes you are
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
that's how the formula works out you're
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
going to work for you're going to work
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
for free
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
so what we're asking in order to make
 
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
this math work in order to bring the
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
cost down is we're going to ask for
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
another year but and there's a big butt
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
the year is not free and not only is the
 
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
Year we're asking you for not free but
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
the year that we made you do for free is
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
no longer free either
 
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.549 align:start position:0%
no longer free either
so

01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
what the the hypothetical worker that
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
worked that got on a month after or a
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
month into this right
 
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
that free year you'll get it two and a
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
half percent
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
and the Year we're asking for you'll get
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
it two and a half percent
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
now what does that do by asking someone
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
to work an additional year they're not
 
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.589 align:start position:0%
to work an additional year they're not
collecting

01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
so there's a that lowers the cost of
 
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.430 align:start position:0%
so there's a that lowers the cost of
this

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
because if you're collect it's almost
 
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
you you put in roughly 12 percent of
 
01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:33.299 align:start position:0%
your pay versus taking a hundred percent
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
of your pension so it's a full flip and
 
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
I Marty can probably explain that far
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
better than I can as to really the
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
mechanics of that but the longer someone
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
stays in the system and doesn't collect
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
so this would phase in annually for 10
 
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.390 align:start position:0%
so this would phase in annually for 10
years

01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
with the ask of the one year
 
01:03:58.849 --> 01:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
now why did I do this
 
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
part of the reason I did it this way
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
was one because I asked the speaker if
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
it was possible and he said yes
 
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
at least from a policy standpoint
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
the second reason is there are folks
 
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
that are burned out
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
there are folks in this room that are
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
burned out I know they're burned out
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
because they've expressed that to me
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
this just this gives them the ability to
 
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
not have to work that year
 
01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:25.460 align:start position:0%
but they're going to have to accept
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
their retirement based on the
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
calculation that is currently in statute
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
so they will not reap the reward of the
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
additional year
 
01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
my concern was that if we did this in a
 
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
different manner it would force them to
 
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
work it wouldn't give them the option
 
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm not
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely comfortable with doing
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
that I think that that's for some folks
 
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
they they've just been abused
 
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
because of our current labor
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances to the point where they
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
just have to go and I and I think that
 
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
that needs to be acknowledged
 
01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.250 align:start position:0%
that needs to be acknowledged
now

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
with that plan in place
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
a line that's uttered all the time up
 
01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
here well you're imposing
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
something on a future legislature
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
we do that all the time
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
everything that we Bond we do that we do
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
a 20-year Bond we're paying for that for
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
20 years the people getting elected two
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
years from now didn't necessarily agree
 
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
to build that bridge
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to being able to to do
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
we bond this in essence is the same
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
Theory it takes this over a 10-year
 
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
period with concessions it it
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
almost rectifies
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
and it makes it workable now is it
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
possible that two years from now the
 
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
legislature the budget could say you
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
know what we're just not going to fund
 
01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
the 25 million to do this they could
 
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:06.059 align:start position:0%
but they're going to have to deal with
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of that
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
because every city in town the New
 
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association they're
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
all going to come in here and go nope
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
wait a minute here
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
and with this the cost of this being
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
palatable and reasonable
 
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
I can't predict what will happen but it
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
would seem unlikely
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
that they would that that's going to be
 
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
the route that they go
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
but from a policy standpoint
 
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
the policy of this would would
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
all goes into effect upon Passage
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
because it's a plan
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
as a way to fix this that's what I was
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
asked to do to fix it
 
01:06:58.609 --> 01:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
and this is the best way I think I can
 
01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:00.059 align:start position:0%
do that for the folks that should have
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the subcommittee it's a
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
lot of information I know and if you
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
don't have a basis for it it's probably
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
a little confusing as well
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Lucas thank you
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
um so I'm looking at the fiscal note and
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
trying to understand it there is no
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it hasn't been run through
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I looked at it online I'm seeing a
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it's never been submitted
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's impossible Amendment what this is
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
an amendment it would basically replace
 
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
the whole bill oh sorry it's a rewrite
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Gerard thank you
 
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
chairman just a quick question how many
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
people are affected by the 125 000 cap
 
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
what are the numbers we're looking at
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
how many people get a pension that goes
 
01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
up near that cap
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
Marty you're gonna have to help me out
 
01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:53.579 align:start position:0%
with that one it's not many
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
um it's not you got to understand you
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
would have to work
 
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:00.380 align:start position:0%
holy crap you would have to do
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
36 years right now
 
01:08:05.809 --> 01:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
so it's it's rare it's you know what I
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
mean it virtually no one in law
 
01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:08.809 align:start position:0%
mean it virtually no one in law
enforcement

01:08:08.809 --> 01:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
very few
 
01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:10.910 align:start position:0%
very few
um

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
on occasion there would be some with
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
fire they have a tendency to work longer
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
but it's you know if if we don't adjust
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
the pension cap I'll tell you this in 20
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
years that will become what kicks you
 
01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
out that's that will become what makes
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
you stop working in 1994 the union
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
leader ran a front page article because
 
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
a Manchester battalion chief
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
received the first 25 000 pension and
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
the union leader called it outrageous
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
why property taxes would absorb almost
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
half of that today
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
it's not livable the poverty level in
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is forty four thousand so
 
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
as you're I know you're well aware the
 
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
dollar and the circumstances that
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
surround the dollar make it such that
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
what looks like something on the high
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
end today in 20 years is not
 
01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:07.309 align:start position:0%
end today in 20 years is not
the

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
so people don't trust retirement system
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt to get some
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
credibility back they don't trust us the
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
retirement system they trust because
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
when they call them they tell them the
 
01:09:14.699 --> 01:09:16.189 align:start position:0%
when they call them they tell them the
truth

01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
truth
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
what you said you don't get the truth oh
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
we get the truth from those guys as best
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
as they can do it you know I mean it's
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
it's the calculation yeah I mean when Mr
 
01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
Carlin was in here talking about another
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars to
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
adjust the computer system
 
01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
they used to do it on they used to do it
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
on a calculator on a desk and now it's
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
well we're gonna have to do a software
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
update and it's you know why
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
yeah you know oh yeah so it's it's the
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
legislature they don't trust the
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
retirement system does what we direct
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
them to do I just so all right follow up
 
01:09:53.809 --> 01:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
let's follow I can't get around this
 
01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
concept though is why do
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't let's say me why do we
 
01:09:59.930 --> 01:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
believe that we're smarter than people
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
with investing their own money that
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
their livelihoods are going to depend on
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
I don't understand it we're we're saying
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the system is messed up blame it on
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
whoever you want we want to keep on
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
building into the system is there any
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
like is there any opportunity to kind of
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
create some way for people to actually
 
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
vote with the dollars and say I don't
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
want to participate in this and just
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
keep all my money no yeah not right now
 
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
the the way the law is written
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
um and the way that this works is that
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
80 of the money that is cut the checks
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
that are cut to people
 
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
comes from the paychecks of the current
 
01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.010 align:start position:0%
comes from the paychecks of the current
workers

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
if you shut that off all right
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
two things happen one the legislature
 
01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
becomes the one that has to pay that
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
because you you've shut off an income
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
stream and secondly we fall out of the
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
windfall Act
 
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
there's Federal things that now come
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
into place the windfall Act is what
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
allows cities and towns to not have to
 
01:10:59.229 --> 01:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
pay social security into group two
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
that is why the pension system is
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
actually cheaper in the Republican Party
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
instituted it in 1967 because it's
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
cheaper than just paying Social Security
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
you don't really see that right now
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
because of the mess that we're in over
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
poor decisions in the 90s but if the
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
pension system was fully funded right
 
01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.090 align:start position:0%
pension system was fully funded right
now

01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns will be on the hook
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
for six percent
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
or or a little less than six percent
 
01:11:28.729 --> 01:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
where they're looking at seven or almost
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
eight percent into Social Security
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why it happened that's why we
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
did it it's it's better for both groups
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
the the employer and the employee
 
01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and also the
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
difference between a direct benefit plan
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
is that the employer is supposed to be
 
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
absorbing the risk and there's no risk
 
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
to the employee they get a defined
 
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
benefit no matter what they get that
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
money and if there's fluctuation in our
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
investments or whatever we we pay in the
 
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.090 align:start position:0%
investments or whatever we we pay in the
extra

01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
extra
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
um whereas if you do a defined
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
contribution obviously the the employee
 
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
is going to go with the ups and downs so
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
it might not have as much potential
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
upward Mobility but it doesn't have the
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
same downward Mobility either
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
hypothetically unless we retroactively
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
take it away 48 states have a pension
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
system for their Emergency Services
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
folks 48 of the 50. representative
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
blinkus and then representation yeah I
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
mean the other side of it they don't
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
know the uh the investment in Market
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
risk however they do have the inflation
 
01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:24.620 align:start position:0%
risk yes
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll just add
 
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
um having served on several special
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
pension committees and observed uh two
 
01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.910 align:start position:0%
pension committees and observed uh two
decennial

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
decennial
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
study commissions uh it's been
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
reinforced several times that if New
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were to change over from a
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
defined benefit system to any other it
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
would cost the state much more money
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
that that's been verified
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
sure I could just ask is that because
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
we're not fully funded or would that be
 
01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
true even if we're the system we're
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
fully funded
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you the mechanism
 
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
mechanations that went into that
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
decision but I can tell you that it was
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
definitely investigated by the
 
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
Legislative let's not go too far down
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
that road right now it's it's an
 
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation we'll have it
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
at another time
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
um yes representative true
 
01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
chess I did try to follow along uh and
 
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
just between you and I I missed by that
 
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.130 align:start position:0%
just between you and I I missed by that
much

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:33.140 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
that's understandable it's it took me
 
01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
three weeks to write it I wouldn't
 
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
expect you to absorb it in 10 minutes
 
01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
expect you to absorb it in 10 minutes
what

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
you kept saying
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
fix it to fix to fix what okay so in in
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
to reiterate in 20 after the decennial
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
Commission in 2011
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
they made a substantial change to the
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
pension law that went retroactive a
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
decade in violation of article 23. so we
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
took away we took away promised benefits
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
so you imagine you you're working for
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
nine years there's a state trooper that
 
01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:08.060 align:start position:0%
I have spoken to 21 days
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
21 days he would have had 10 years and
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
they came in and said oh you know what
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're just redoing the whole thing well
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
that aside the fact that it's
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I think it's unethical
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
you know you you made a decision
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
to take into employment with the a
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
municipal subdivision or a or the state
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
based on a whole bunch of things right
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
you looked at pay you looked at benefits
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
you looked at retirement that's all part
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
of the package so to come in eight nine
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
ten years later and say oh you know what
 
01:14:42.169 --> 01:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
the government can do this so we're just
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
gonna we're just gonna recalculate
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's why the con that's why in 1784
 
01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
article 23 was put in don't do it and
 
01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
they did so this
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
almost just undoes that what happened
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
for just those folks you would have had
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
to have been working so essentially what
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
it means to make the long story short is
 
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
that what you were promised when when
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
you signed on the dotted line to take
 
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
the job you're pretty much going to get
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
that not quite but a whole lot closer
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
than what you're going to get under our
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
current system by about 30 percent so um
 
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
right is that correct about thirty
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
percent it would depend on your length
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
of service yeah what the exception that
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative Simon's talking about is
 
01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:26.900 align:start position:0%
there were safeguards that were put in
 
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
in 09 they call it anti-spiking
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
Provisions to prevent the misuse of the
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
system I none of those are being removed
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
all of the anti-spiking provisions the
 
01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:42.179 align:start position:0%
150 rule I I could get into the
 
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
technical part of it but those are all
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
left in there so
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
we didn't so we were leaving the
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
protections for the protections are in
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
there for those that are but we're
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
giving them the opportunity to get the
 
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
retirement package that they were
 
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
promised when they signed on and not the
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
greatly reduced one that happened when
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
we retroactively so somebody somebody
 
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
signed on the dotted line said this is
 
01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to agree to work for and
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
then they worked under that assumption
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
for maybe nine and a half years and then
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
after working nine and a half years
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
under that assumption the state came in
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
and said oh just kidding it's going to
 
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
be a lot less for time that they had
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
already dedicated themselves for
 
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
um so I mean not to put too much out
 
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
there at the moment but I agree it's not
 
01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:26.390 align:start position:0%
there at the moment but I agree it's not
just

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
um illegal it's also unethical and
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
immoral from my perspective but uh
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh so a few minutes
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
ago you used the word unconstitutional
 
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
and you said that about
 
01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
two days ago no it was only about an
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
hour ago
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
um twice you use it made the assertion
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
that something was unconstitutional is
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
that ever adjudicated and declared to be
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it the lawsuit that was
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
filed in 2011 was not on constitutional
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
grounds and I want to make that very
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
clear the lawsuit in 2011 sued the state
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
under the contract clause
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to repeat this it is not a
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
contract it's not a contract the word
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
contract doesn't appear in 100a
 
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
so we lost
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
it was not sued under the
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of it should have been
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
but that's not what happened
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson Am I Wrong Am I
 
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
misremembering this did the judge say
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
that if it had been that they probably
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
would have according to folks in the
 
01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:35.900 align:start position:0%
room there was an unusual
 
01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:38.900 align:start position:0%
occurrence that happened where the judge
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
afterwards had a conversation with the
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
parties involved explaining why he had
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
to rule the way he did and offered
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
free legal advice to say you should have
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
I wasn't in the room there are folks
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
that were there I've heard the story
 
01:17:59.090 --> 01:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
from multiple people that were there
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
but so I I don't want I don't want it to
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
be people to think that oh well they
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
sued over this and they lost
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
that that's not what happened it's not
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
how that actually occurred they sued
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
under a false a faulty premise
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
but I I'm just want to make sure that
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
when you say the word unconstitutionally
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
it gets thrown around pretty freely some
 
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
conversations so if
 
01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:26.570 align:start position:0%
conversations so if
um

01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
it but it was never adjudicated and
 
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
declared to be unconstitutional correct
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
correct that would be my opinion
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're getting
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
you understand that
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
something's only unconstitutional
 
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
because things that the legislature does
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
are deemed and this is uh a pretty Solid
 
01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
Ground I'm talking about things that are
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
done by the con by the legislature are
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
deemed to be constitutional
 
01:18:58.970 --> 01:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
unless they are adjudicated and declared
 
01:19:01.209 --> 01:19:01.219 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court to be
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional then they're
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional word gets thrown around
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
a lot sure so I think I I I'm
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable when you say something it
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
could be that what was done was improper
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
or illegal or unwise or whatever but if
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
you want me to preface when I use that
 
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I will I will do
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
so well I'm going to disregard the your
 
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
use of the word unconstitutional if if
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
it has not been adjudicated and found to
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
but but there were I I was here when
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit was uh you know ongoing and
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
the unions sued and with regard to the
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
colas and a number of other teachers
 
01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:49.580 align:start position:0%
union suit under the coolest yep
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
and and the decision was uh you know
 
01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:56.540 align:start position:0%
it was a pretty drastic one in terms of
 
01:19:59.450 --> 01:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
declaring that this particular thing was
 
01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:00.890 align:start position:0%
declaring that this particular thing was
not

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
like like the colas you know they had
 
01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:04.820 align:start position:0%
been done
 
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
periodically as as was appropriate but
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
it was uh it's it stopped and and the
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
state says we ain't going to do that
 
01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.229 align:start position:0%
state says we ain't going to do that
anymore

01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know we've had several uh you
 
01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
know one-time payments since then we've
 
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
had an occasional uh Cola and so forth
 
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
but the regular colas that had been done
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
quite regularly up to that point were
 
01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:35.780 align:start position:0%
stopped and as you know the the previous
 
01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh the previous actuaries that we had
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
had you know gotten us into the
 
01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
situation we this has come up before
 
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:45.470 align:start position:0%
situation we this has come up before
that

01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
um we were told we were 125 percent
 
01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
funded we we we instituted the uh the
 
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.370 align:start position:0%
funded we we we instituted the uh the
special

01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
special
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
um this special I'm blanking of the word
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
now the account that's right the special
 
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.810 align:start position:0%
now the account that's right the special
account

01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
um so that stopped and uh and all the
 
01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:07.460 align:start position:0%
money over a certain percentage was was
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh was flowing into the special account
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
sure and so forth so you never had a
 
01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
good year because you had bad years yeah
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
and revenue and investment wise you had
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
good years but you never had years where
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
it went over a certain amount because
 
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
all that money flowed into the special
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
account yeah that's true representative
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
Schmidt but it has nothing to do without
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
what I've got proposed in front of you
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
right but I'm just saying that that I
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
was here for all that so I do remember a
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
lot of it uh but but but
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
again I I I I want you to stick closer
 
01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:45.649 align:start position:0%
again I I I I want you to stick closer
to

01:21:45.649 --> 01:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
no I I don't want to hear
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional if it hasn't been
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
adjudicated okay okay gotcha
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
would be better to say it would appear
 
01:21:57.850 --> 01:21:57.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
I understand that and we we hear that
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
word thrown around all that's
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional that no that was that
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
was a genuine question though is that is
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
that a better way to go about it I I'm
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
I'm fine
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
with a better use of legal language okay
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
um one second representative Marty this
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
I believe is hot off the presses you
 
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to look at this at
 
01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
all correct how long would it take the
 
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
uh an HRS to analyze and come up with a
 
01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
correct this is a work group so work
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
session where the intent is to do so
 
01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh after the input of the work session
 
01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be fantastic if you
 
01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.450 --> 01:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
yeah if there was anything of substance
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't want to
 
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
miss that out so so generally the way
 
01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
um legislative analysis works I mean I
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
again having not seen this bill
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
um just from the description
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Pierce input for it that
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
does seem to be some Actuarial
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
calculation issues with that
 
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
um uh so that would require setting the
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill out to our actuary uh under uh the
 
01:23:25.850 --> 01:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
statutory framework for the way though
 
01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:28.460 align:start position:0%
that works now with proposed legislation
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
we only send it out to the actuary for
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
analysis uh we know when when an LSR is
 
01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.330 align:start position:0%
analysis uh we know when when an LSR is
introduced

01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
um or if a bill is amended uh by a
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
policy or by a committee and adopted by
 
01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
that the larger body before it goes to
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
the next committee or the next chamber
 
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
we would run an Actuarial analysis
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
um on that so that's the normal course
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
of how that would work so so the jury
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
answer is saying I don't think we could
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
be able to take this today and ship it
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
off to the actuary and and run up um you
 
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
know so we're not going to head line by
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
the 16th yeah
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
so uh you know we we can if there's
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
anything in it that is just sort of a
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
mathematical exercise you know number of
 
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
head count times x you know those things
 
01:24:17.209 --> 01:24:17.219 align:start position:0%
you know we can do ourselves there's no
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
outside costs associated with it from
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
the trust fund
 
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
um you know we can we can work those
 
01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.689 align:start position:0%
um you know we can we can work those
through

01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:26.219 align:start position:0%
um so you know that that's that's how we
 
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
how the process generally Works uh as
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson said uh one of
 
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
the bills put in
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
um last uh one of the ones that was um
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
recommended itl last week was sort of
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
the high-end possibility you know of the
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
range of how much anything could cost
 
01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:46.340 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
presumably this is this is going to be
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
less than that but exactly what it is we
 
01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know until we until the actuary
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
tells us because there's a lot of moving
 
01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
parts and maybe interact with each other
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
and representative Pearson you're saying
 
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
here that
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
the that the um source to cover this
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
would come out of the state budget okay
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
just making sure that I have that
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
so there's two ways to do this right you
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
either pre-fund it which has been a way
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've tried to do things with the with
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
changes since since 2011 that's kind of
 
01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.669 align:start position:0%
changes since since 2011 that's kind of
been

01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
so we haven't totally adhered to that
 
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
um the the second option is it's a rate
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
change it goes into the rate calculation
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the third option is a hybrid of
 
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
paying for
 
01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
a chunk of it out of the budget and then
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
having a rate change so
 
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
Finance likes is consistency and that's
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
why it was with the trottier bill at 249
 
01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.930 align:start position:0%
why it was with the trottier bill at 249
million

01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
this is a 10-year plan divided by 10
 
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
except in this case years 9 and 10 are
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
kind of already paid for by a prior
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
house bill because this absorbs what
 
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
that change was that was paid for last
 
01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.410 align:start position:0%
that change was that was paid for last
year

01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:26:11.689 --> 01:26:11.699 align:start position:0%
so really it's years nine and ten are
 
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
already kind of paid for yeah so
 
01:26:15.179 --> 01:26:16.129 align:start position:0%
already kind of paid for yeah so
um

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
if I can stop you there for just a
 
01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:18.410 align:start position:0%
if I can stop you there for just a
second

01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.370 align:start position:0%
second
um

01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
I guess one of the things that I just
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
need clarification on is
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to have an
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
exact fiscal note probably before our
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
deadline to send it to a second
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
committee correct so we're going to have
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
to make our decision solely based off of
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
policy and then allow fiscal to deal
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
with the money aspect of it and whether
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay for it
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
does that sound right
 
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's the circumstances
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
that we're in with the current rule
 
01:26:46.199 --> 01:26:47.149 align:start position:0%
that we're in with the current rule
makeup

01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
makeup
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
that exists from the legislature to the
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
retirement system the speaker has
 
01:26:51.719 --> 01:26:53.209 align:start position:0%
retirement system the speaker has
expressed

01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
interest in modifying that
 
01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:58.139 align:start position:0%
um well you were in the room when it
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
happened yeah so
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
that the legislature needs more
 
01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.050 align:start position:0%
that the legislature needs more
flexibility

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
in limited cases by limited people
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
to get a more responsive movement out of
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
retirement so that we can make educated
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
decisions on things that
 
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
are really going somewhere okay but
 
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative true sorry I
 
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
um so a question to you Mr chair and you
 
01:27:31.129 --> 01:27:31.139 align:start position:0%
can direct it wherever you wish
 
01:27:31.139 --> 01:27:33.709 align:start position:0%
can direct it wherever you wish
um

01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
and I and I realize this is just a rough
 
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
draft and all that so maybe it's a 30
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
increase in cost
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
or is a 30 increase in the retirement
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
benefits it's in the benefit and because
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the actual Actuarial process it's not
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a like straight up
 
01:27:57.169 --> 01:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
and is that 30 increase in the
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits paid for by the 25
 
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year that's the idea
 
01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:05.750 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year that's the idea
yes

01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
in that I'm sorry no continue Matt all
 
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.470 align:start position:0%
in that I'm sorry no continue Matt all
that

01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.570 align:start position:0%
 
erases

01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
erases
 
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:17.219 align:start position:0%
what needed to be fixed from 2011.
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt did you want to
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
say something you look like you wanted
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
to say something oh you're pointing to
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative right
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
so just so I understand um
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
I understand this will change the
 
01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits people who are
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
currently in the system get when they
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
retire if under some circumstance
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
depending on when they were hired is it
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to change the pension that people
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
who are currently retired will get no
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the things that is is
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
why we're in a bit of a sense of urgency
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
the first group of people affected by
 
01:28:51.649 --> 01:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
this were eligible to retire yesterday
 
01:28:56.209 --> 01:28:56.219 align:start position:0%
yeah so we don't have time to kick this
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
down the road because once you retire
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
that's it there's no going back there's
 
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
no recalculating there's no changes you
 
01:29:06.169 --> 01:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
you're done that's that's why the seat's
 
01:29:08.050 --> 01:29:08.060 align:start position:0%
so fun at the moment okay
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
are kind of related just to follow up to
 
01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
an earlier question
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
um so is my understanding correct
 
01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong that we go to
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
vote for I'm not on the subcommittee
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
when you vote for it in full committee
 
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
we don't know how much this is going to
 
01:29:24.169 --> 01:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
cost and we know what the maximum amount
 
01:29:28.370 --> 01:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
it would cost because in essence this is
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
with without concessions the trottier
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill which we have a fiscal note for is
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
this concept with no concessions this
 
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
has concessions in it that would lower
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
the cost to the extent I don't know
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
because retirement has to run those
 
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
numbers Max 200. okay and is there in
 
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
the bill or are there the amendment um
 
01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
does it have anything in there about
 
01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
what portion would be paid out of the
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
general fund and what portion would be
 
01:29:55.739 --> 01:29:57.530 align:start position:0%
general fund and what portion would be
paid

01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
um out of the by the employers through
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
the retirement system in essence it does
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
by by flat funding that at 25 million a
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
year for 10 years
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
that is the number coming out of the
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
general fund whatever would be overage
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
if there was any would come out into the
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
rate but at that point you're talking a
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
because you know you'd have to take you
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
know if it's 25.4 that year the 400 000
 
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
would and that's that's those numbers
 
01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
are are almost not calculable they're so
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
low no follow-up yes okay so excluding
 
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
the uh value of the concessions which we
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
um this would be
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
um 250 million dollars over 10 years and
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
yes to a present value is less than 250
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars but uh but that's
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
basically what you're talking about last
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
some unknown amount for the concessions
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
and also based on the fact we're in a
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
down stock market so in the cyclical
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
side of things would those numbers be
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
lower in the future probably yeah I mean
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
25 million a year we're doing cost value
 
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
averaging and effect and all that but
 
01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
yeah okay you get what I'm saying with
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
that so thank you
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the final version of this should we
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration a little
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
bit as opposed to it just being a 25
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
million flat which is here well the 25
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
million flat would just stay flat and
 
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
then you know Peaks and valleys if you
 
01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
will if that particular year it's a
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more than it needs to be then
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
the following year
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
I mean technically it has to be put in
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
the budget so the I guess Finance would
 
01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
wiggle that number if they thought it
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you for yeah thank you so much
 
01:31:50.810 --> 01:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh for all your work on this
 
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I appreciate it
 
01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.970 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I appreciate it
um

01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of a difficult situation
 
01:31:59.570 --> 01:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of information
 
01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:00.590 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of information
um

01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
we do have deadlines and the chair of
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
the committee wants us to push this
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
along as expeditiously as possible
 
01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
um for obvious reasons as representative
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson mentioned that people were
 
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.070 align:start position:0%
Pearson mentioned that people were
already

01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
eligible to retire who fall under this
 
01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:16.729 align:start position:0%
eligible to retire who fall under this
plan

01:32:16.729 --> 01:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
um it's a bit complicated it's a lot of
 
01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
money I appreciate all of that stuff
 
01:32:22.729 --> 01:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
um but we're probably going to have to
 
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
make a policy decision relatively soon
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I guess the impression that I would
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
just leave like to leave on the
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee myself
 
01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
is this is a broken promise this is
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
something that was due that wasn't paid
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a bit different than raising
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
something for the future something new
 
01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:38.219 align:start position:0%
for the future
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
um we said we were going to do this and
 
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
then we did not do this
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and it's difficult
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
for somebody like me who's coming along
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
10 years after it happened had nothing
 
01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
to do with it and we have to fix it in a
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
very short period of time
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
um but I would like to at least put that
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
plug out there that I think that we have
 
01:32:58.610 --> 01:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
a moral and ethical responsibility to
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
uphold our under the bargain and try to
 
01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.729 align:start position:0%
uphold our under the bargain and try to
replace

01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
replace
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
um some of the trust that the people put
 
01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
in US originally
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
um does anybody else have from a policy
 
01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
perspective on this I'm familiar with it
 
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
because I've kind of been in the process
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
as it's been created so I don't have as
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
many questions on the policy but does
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions policy
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
wise are just kind of
 
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
got feelings that you'd like to express
 
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:26.710 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I ever mentioned 28a
 
01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:29.570 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I ever mentioned 28a
[Laughter]

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
didn't know
 
01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.610 align:start position:0%
didn't know
um

01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
according to my notes
 
01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
because all we're talking about is 436
 
01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about this because
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
this doesn't exist
 
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
right so at the moment we're talking
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
about the amendment and not for I mean
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
the the what we're talking about right
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
now is potentially replacing 436 with
 
01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
so 436 will Disappear Completely it will
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
be completely replaced by this amendment
 
01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's at least what we're talking about
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
at the moment before it leaves this
 
01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
committee before it leaves this
 
01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.790 align:start position:0%
committee before it leaves this
committee

01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
before the deadline
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.739 --> 01:34:15.890 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
I'm the original offer author of the
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill you're talking about and I have no
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
problem replacing it entirely with this
 
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
amendment I've read the whole Amendment
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
and I understand pretty closely how it
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
works and it is uh what we intended to
 
01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
do in the first place so uh I would
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you did make this an
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to that bill total replacement
 
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate that input
 
01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:45.010 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate that input
uh

01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:45.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
you and then you
 
01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:49.850 align:start position:0%
you and then you
so

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
according to my notes 436 was going to
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
add 133 millions in unfunded liability
 
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
I was I didn't like that idea and it was
 
01:35:03.649 --> 01:35:03.659 align:start position:0%
going to add about 10 million dollars a
 
01:35:03.659 --> 01:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
going to add about 10 million dollars a
year

01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh to the cost to the towns unfunded
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
liability so just so you know this one
 
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
isn't recommending that so the um the
 
01:35:14.689 --> 01:35:14.699 align:start position:0%
amendment would be paid for by the state
 
01:35:14.699 --> 01:35:18.310 align:start position:0%
amendment would be paid for by the state
and

01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
with yes so with that understanding if
 
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
we can do all that in the short amount
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
then I don't think I would object to the
 
01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.649 align:start position:0%
then I don't think I would object to the
amendment

01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
unless something comes out that it's not
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
going to be covered by 25 million a year
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
from the general fund uh we forgot about
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars to this to the towns
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
whoops my mistake
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
. I'm uh representative my Point's just
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
been covered okay very good yes sir
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative Goldie
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair quick question
 
01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.669 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair quick question
to

01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
I know that that I know the chair was
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
looking to exec this next week obviously
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson doesn't have the
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted yet
 
01:36:25.729 --> 01:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
um has there been any consultation with
 
01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
the chair I know deadline isn't until
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
the following week to push this off
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
another week so you we can meet discuss
 
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
the full amendment in front of us and
 
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
have a little time to digest I'm not
 
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
sure that I have any other option to be
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
honest with you I think we may have to
 
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
do that there's just so much involved
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
um yes I mean her preference would be
 
01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
that this is exact next Wednesday for
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
obvious reasons we're just up against a
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
bunch of deadlines
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
um but it's such a such a big piece I'm
 
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
just not sure that we can necessarily
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
push it through in that amount of time
 
01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
it would be nice to have one more week
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
to yeah it would be nice to have like
 
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
another year but
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
um we don't we don't have that so
 
01:37:03.719 --> 01:37:06.470 align:start position:0%
um we don't we don't have that so
um

01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you representative true
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comments on this
 
01:37:09.719 --> 01:37:11.930 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comments on this
initially

01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
initially
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Gerhard thank you
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I think it's good I mean I
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
understand it's expensive but like you
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
said money owed
 
01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:20.209 align:start position:0%
said money owed
so

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I appreciate the work that the
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
representative put into work on this
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is a lot so yeah that's my position
 
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.250 align:start position:0%
this is a lot so yeah that's my position
yeah

01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
it was fun to be there when the light
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
bulb went on it was uh kind of
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
interesting it's a good conversation
 
01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.890 align:start position:0%
interesting it's a good conversation
um

01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.209 --> 01:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
is there anybody on the subcommittee who
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
is opposed to this
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
knows that they're opposed to this and
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to being opposed to
 
01:37:45.719 --> 01:37:49.550 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to being opposed to
this

01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
how would the subcommittee feel then uh
 
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
contradiction to what I just said about
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
pushing it through on a policy
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
perspective and then trying to hammer
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
out the details at the exact session
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
kind of like building a second floor
 
01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
before you got the first thing I agree
 
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:38:17.209 --> 01:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
all right so I'll disappoint the chair
 
01:38:17.219 --> 01:38:18.350 align:start position:0%
all right so I'll disappoint the chair
then

01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
the thing is I I'm very disposed to try
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
to do what we can to undo some of the
 
01:38:28.729 --> 01:38:28.739 align:start position:0%
damage that was done you know 10 years
 
01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
ago uh because promises were were made
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
that were not kept or promised that were
 
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
made that were broken uh and when the
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
court basically said you stop we're not
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
going to do this or this or this anymore
 
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
this is the new set of rules uh that
 
01:38:49.370 --> 01:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
caused a lot of damage to not merely the
 
01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
trust that the people of New Hampshire
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
but especially are the employees and
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
union members no question about it uh
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
and to the degree that we've got some
 
01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
money available that we can start to
 
01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
not only rebuild that trust but but but
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
to make good on broken promises I'm in
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
favor of that the the mechanics of the
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
situation are still somewhat troubling
 
01:39:16.570 --> 01:39:16.580 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me like the the
 
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
represent Pearson your
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
then your your magnum opus here uh is is
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
pretty rough in terms of being able to
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
grasp it as whole You've got it you've
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
worked it all out so you understand it
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
for the rest of us well for for me
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
anyway to some degree it's kind of like
 
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
a box with a lot of parts that have not
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
yet been connected together right so so
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
to calm your fears
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
um OLS has gone through the references
 
01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
to and they as far as which parts of the
 
01:39:52.729 --> 01:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
rsas must be changed that has already
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
gone through OLS so this there's no
 
01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
question as to that I have the right
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
parts modified because it's already been
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
done by a OLS in a different bill so
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
that part of it is I didn't fly blind
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
because to the degree that they haven't
 
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
got it done yet when we're up against
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
those deadlines then we're not going to
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that we can actually
 
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
vote on right either in this
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or in the full committee
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
you will on the full committee because
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going down we don't want to be there
 
01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:21.179 align:start position:0%
but you're telling me that they've
 
01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:23.540 align:start position:0%
they've done this work and this is
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
except for correcting the spelling of
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
the word dissemination which has two s's
 
01:40:31.129 --> 01:40:31.139 align:start position:0%
or else it's a different word than I
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
know I have I have Word 97
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt they they must
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
have changed the spelling sorry I'm
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to OLS in in 10 minutes your
 
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
statement just now is very very I know
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
reassurance sorry representation but I
 
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
should have mentioned that I did know
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
that yes representative Brian yeah thank
 
01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:50.219 align:start position:0%
you I think representative Pearson just
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
said the whole complete thing he's going
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
to OLS as right after this it'll get its
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh number it'll get its stamp brought
 
01:40:59.689 --> 01:40:59.699 align:start position:0%
back then it becomes part of the bill
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
and then you have legitimate authority
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
to discuss question at that particular
 
01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
Point as far as my parliamentarian that
 
01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
I know of that's it I mean we can
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
discuss all over the place but until we
 
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
got a finalized amendment that we can
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:15.980 align:start position:0%
that's right we're
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:21.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas uh you know I'm
 
01:41:25.129 --> 01:41:25.139 align:start position:0%
not on the subcommittee but I mean if
 
01:41:27.410 --> 01:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
unless I had an actual real Amendment
 
01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
and some time to look at it I'd be
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
disinclined to vote for this in full
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee yeah no that's fair no I agree
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh just my only consideration was what I
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
was asked to do but I think everybody's
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
concerns are legitimate
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
um representative Gully representative
 
01:41:43.199 --> 01:41:44.390 align:start position:0%
um representative Gully representative
O'Brien

01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
O'Brien
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
I too agree but I always worry when we
 
01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
try and meet amendments with deadlines
 
01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:55.250 align:start position:0%
try and meet amendments with deadlines
because

01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
most of us who've been around here long
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
enough know when you go to exec with an
 
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
amendment fresh off the press that there
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
are mistakes made and that's why I would
 
01:42:05.209 --> 01:42:05.219 align:start position:0%
prefer to push it off a week because to
 
01:42:06.649 --> 01:42:06.659 align:start position:0%
review the document make sure it's
 
01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:08.219 align:start position:0%
correct when we have it in front of us
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to be here sitting
 
01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
here waiting for a redraft as we're
 
01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
executing I am going to be all over this
 
01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:16.139 align:start position:0%
like I said representative Pratt and I
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
are going downstairs in as soon as this
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
work session is over that process will
 
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
start and in the Preamble like I said
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
was written by OLS they already wrote it
 
01:42:25.619 --> 01:42:27.169 align:start position:0%
was written by OLS they already wrote it
so

01:42:27.169 --> 01:42:27.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
um we will definitely be all over that
 
01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:31.139 align:start position:0%
to make sure they they don't do what you
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
and I both know happen sometimes and
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
goof stuff up and if you could please
 
01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
get that to me the second you have the
 
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
second I have it that would be you want
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
to be a co-sponsor I would love to be a
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
coach okay then you'll get it the second
 
01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
I get it okay yes
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
as soon as it's ready to go to the whole
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee because it's going to be big
 
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
and we all have to vote on it agreed
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
yeah no and I will make sure that it
 
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
gets to everybody for sure
 
01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
me again all right well
 
01:42:58.129 --> 01:42:58.139 align:start position:0%
we've got some we've got some work to do
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%

01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment forward
 
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:05.820 align:start position:0%

bill
 
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
um this brings one more element to it
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
that we haven't discussed in this
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to a certain extent which is
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
um giving a an increased benefit to
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
people who didn't fall in that 10-year
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
transitional period it's just for every
 
01:44:02.050 --> 01:44:02.060 align:start position:0%
employee from this point forward
 
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
which is something that we need to look
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
at also expeditiously
 
01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:09.709 align:start position:0%
at also expeditiously
um

01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
and Steve's already left unfortunately
 
01:44:15.169 --> 01:44:15.179 align:start position:0%
um I I just need a whole lot more
 
01:44:15.179 --> 01:44:17.030 align:start position:0%
um I I just need a whole lot more
information

01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
um yes yeah if you could try
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
I should have mentioned that too well I
 
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming back
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
I thought you were going straight to OLS
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
you couldn't have because you're back
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
I got lost
 
01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you found your way back here
 
01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:52.689 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you found your way back here
um

01:44:52.689 --> 01:44:52.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at 449 we're talking about
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
benefits uh increased benefits to I'll
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
just give you the summary
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
or the idea anyway we're looking at
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
increased benefits for everybody not
 
01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:04.139 align:start position:0%
just for the people who fell in the
 
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
10-year transitional window
 
01:45:09.649 --> 01:45:09.659 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
in that that's great within within the
 
01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
context of that conversation we've been
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
talking about comparatively to Regional
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
compensation you know we're looking at
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont Massachusetts what's
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
happening in those programs sure
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
um if we're seriously going to look at a
 
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
potential increased benefit I would like
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
to have those comparative numbers what
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
are there other places doing okay I can
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
give you a sum up it's I don't need it
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
right now um because we're gonna have to
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
have another subcommittee meeting anyway
 
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
you're you're I can tell you you're
 
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
going to appreciate the way New
 
01:45:41.290 --> 01:45:41.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law is written yeah because
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
Maine is so bad and so it's like they
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
filled a bucket with mud and shot it
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
into the side of a barn I had to call
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine I couldn't even find
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
it it's so bad but
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
in essence we're we're not competitive
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
with any of the New England states at
 
01:45:57.719 --> 01:45:58.490 align:start position:0%
with any of the New England states at
all

01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:46:01.689 --> 01:46:01.699 align:start position:0%
so I mean I can give you some highlights
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
Vermont vests at two years they take
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
their top two years our current folks
 
01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:10.860 align:start position:0%
it's top five but some of it's your
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
entire career average depending on what
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
some of our stuff doesn't count at all
 
01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
some of our stuff gets diluted
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
um depending on
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
how your municipality classifies it
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
Maine just changed their vesting in 2021
 
01:46:32.689 --> 01:46:32.699 align:start position:0%
Maine went from a 10-year vest to a five
 
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island's a five Connecticut has
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
got some Municipal parts to it but
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
roughly a five Massachusetts state at 10
 
01:46:42.649 --> 01:46:42.659 align:start position:0%
but Massachusetts in order for you to do
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
10 their calculations are substantially
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
better than ours and that's arguably our
 
01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:50.219 align:start position:0%
primary competitor
 
01:46:53.090 --> 01:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
from a from a labor standpoint in New
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right we literally built our
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
interstates for people to go to work in
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
Mass so
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
um you know if
 
01:47:03.970 --> 01:47:03.980 align:start position:0%
if we want to take a deep dive in that
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's certainly welcome it to look at
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on around us but I'm going
 
01:47:10.129 --> 01:47:10.139 align:start position:0%
to tell you guys right now you're going
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
to be very disappointed because we are
 
01:47:14.050 --> 01:47:14.060 align:start position:0%
just we are not
 
01:47:17.689 --> 01:47:17.699 align:start position:0%
as an example the city of Manchester
 
01:47:20.689 --> 01:47:20.699 align:start position:0%
just lost a firefighter or let me
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
rephrase that a firefighter in the city
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
of Manchester just resigned
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
grew up in Manchester folks live in
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester he's going to the Carolinas
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
because what we have to offer is crap
 
01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
and he has no faith in us he's gone so
 
01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:38.699 align:start position:0%
this isn't you know this isn't a guy
 
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
that decided to hey I want to move to
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because it's awesome
 
01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
though I can understand that this is a
 
01:47:44.689 --> 01:47:44.699 align:start position:0%
guy I grew up here
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
city of the Manchester police
 
01:47:48.290 --> 01:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
departments lost 47 officers in the last
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
18 months that's a that's 25 of their
 
01:47:53.229 --> 01:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
Police Department they're just done
 
01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
because what we offer them today is not
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
competitive they go other states they
 
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
just walk away they get into other other
 
01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:02.149 align:start position:0%
just walk away they get into other other
areas

01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not just one thing it's
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
it's multifaceted but
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
we have a massive labor problem
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
we can't afford to lose a single person
 
01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
which is the impetus of what my bill is
 
01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
my amendment is is to stop people from
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
retiring or try to get them to stop
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
retiring and there's no you know in most
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
of these profession there's no one in
 
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
the back door Corrections has 300
 
01:48:23.649 --> 01:48:23.659 align:start position:0%
vacancies the state troopers have 70
 
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
every single County Sheriff's Office is
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
begging for people we have
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are now stealing
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
employees from other municipalities none
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
of this stuff was happening when I
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
started in the emergency services 20
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
years ago I tested with 400 people for
 
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
nine spots
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay we have no hiring list in the city
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
of Manchester for the fire department
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
400 I feel we filled the Central High
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
cafeteria with applicants
 
01:48:53.090 --> 01:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
so something's wrong I mean this is New
 
01:48:54.649 --> 01:48:54.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a great place to live we've
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
ex I grew up here I I have lived in
 
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
other places but
 
01:49:01.850 --> 01:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
um you know this New Hampshire was a
 
01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
draw there's a lot of things that we
 
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
have here that are very appealing so
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
when we get to the point where we can't
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
even attract employees or we have people
 
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:12.659 align:start position:0%
that grew up here that are leaving
 
01:49:15.410 --> 01:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's like holy smokes okay
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
so yeah there needs to be a look I I'd
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
almost argue that there needs to be a
 
01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
reconvening of the decennial commission
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
honestly because that's that's the
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
extent to which
 
01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
this dive would need to happen to do it
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
right you could kind of piecemeal bits
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
and pieces I suppose as you go but if
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to do it properly that
 
01:49:39.129 --> 01:49:39.139 align:start position:0%
commission probably should be reconvened
 
01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
and really just you you would bring in
 
01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
the proper people
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
to do analysis I guess here's part of my
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
question and representative Goliad
 
01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
actually like some input for me
 
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
potentially on this as well um just for
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
starters so it seems like seems like the
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
priority at the moment right um because
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
we have weeks to deal with this and of
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
course we're up against the budget this
 
01:50:03.169 --> 01:50:03.179 align:start position:0%
year not next year so if we missed this
 
01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
this year then it's a couple years
 
01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:07.430 align:start position:0%
this year then it's a couple years
um

01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
I want I want to make sure that
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
the last piece of legislation that we
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
just worked on has the best possible
 
01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
chance of getting getting through okay
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and part of that's Financial I'm
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
looking at representative goalie's Bill
 
01:50:22.609 --> 01:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
uh looks like the fiscal note is 2026 13
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
million 320. how much of the gap between
 
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
us and our competitors
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
would be filled with your proposal
 
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
like how close is it going to get us to
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
our competitors at all close like is it
 
01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay so this is I mean it's not really
 
01:50:47.570 --> 01:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
like information on because I think
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
that's why this is a commission level
 
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
request because because let's if we're
 
01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
gonna any if we're gonna fix something
 
01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
let's just fix it let's not throw bubble
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
gum on the side of the tire and keep
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
driving down the road here you know what
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
I mean well so so my question would be
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
going back to the conversation we had
 
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
earlier would it be wise to retain this
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
bill and potentially look at turning it
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
into a commission to actually address
 
01:51:10.729 --> 01:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
the issue even though that pushes off
 
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
Mike

01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.729 --> 01:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
my concern is I I just I would prefer
 
01:51:28.739 --> 01:51:30.410 align:start position:0%
my concern is I I just I would prefer
sending

01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
sending
 
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
two options to finance with
 
01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:35.699 align:start position:0%
two price tags so they have
 
01:51:38.090 --> 01:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
two different vehicles to work with
 
01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:38.750 align:start position:0%
two different vehicles to work with
um

01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:43.490 --> 01:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
comfortable not knowing
 
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
finance's reaction of what's going to go
 
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
forward on a and it I've been around
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
budgeting something out over eight or
 
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
ten years
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of folks around here
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
you can discuss it however you want
 
01:52:05.450 --> 01:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
saying it doesn't happen or it does
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
happen that
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
binding a future legislation
 
01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:10.729 align:start position:0%
binding a future legislation
um

01:52:10.729 --> 01:52:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:10.739 --> 01:52:12.350 align:start position:0%
um
legislature

01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
to a cost
 
01:52:18.290 --> 01:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
it has come up and
 
01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned about that and we
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
talk about well once we pass it
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
and it's paid out over 10 years that if
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
for some reason we decide not to fund it
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
well we'll have the municipalities and
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have everybody in here knocking on
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
the door so that will never happen
 
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
let me remind you the state paid 35
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
percent of retirement costs for
 
01:52:43.729 --> 01:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
municipalities the municipalities came
 
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
in here kicking and screaming
 
01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
and the legislature still cut that
 
01:52:48.659 --> 01:52:49.669 align:start position:0%
and the legislature still cut that
funding

01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that's my only concern okay
 
01:52:55.609 --> 01:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
yes representative like us not on the
 
01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
larger issue but um trying to understand
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on this
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a total for 2026
 
01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:05.390 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a total for 2026
13.3

01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
13.3
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
million and this is going to be paid by
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
all the employers so this one is not
 
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
funded by the state as I understand it
 
01:53:16.129 --> 01:53:16.139 align:start position:0%
versus that correct and second of all is
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
that going to I mean that's going to be
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
a larger amount going forward
 
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
indefinitely if I understand correctly
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:28.139 align:start position:0%
that's how I read it
 
01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.609 --> 01:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
well Jeff how are we going to do this
 
01:53:37.609 --> 01:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
thing about send two two plans to
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
finance whatever we come up with has got
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
to go through the house be adopted
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
before it can go to finance what kind of
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
a vehicle is going to have the kind of
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
options you're talking about
 
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if we go for the
 
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
whole Apple at once you you miss all of
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
it you know like if we try to address
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
well I I'm not going I'm only asking
 
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
right what what what's this bill going
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
to look like
 
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
that wants to give Finance two options
 
01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so it would be two
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
different bills the one we just heard
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
the rip the amendment
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
just two separate bills okay so you're
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
talking about not not this bill but the
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:26.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
because I I remember
 
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
you remember Steve because you were
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
sitting there I think Jeff and Diane
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
were there too over 301 303
 
01:54:39.010 --> 01:54:39.020 align:start position:0%
double double room with about
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
150 guys that looked like this gentleman
 
01:54:44.109 --> 01:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
here in the back with the beard okay
 
01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
well I don't think you can get 450 guys
 
01:54:49.370 --> 01:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
in in no double rooms they were on
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
multiple of course full of guys uh that
 
01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
that did not look happy about where
 
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
things were or where things were going
 
01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
um and so we we got to try and undo as
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
much of that as possible because we are
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
bleeding in this state we're bleeding
 
01:55:05.219 --> 01:55:08.750 align:start position:0%
bleeding in this state we're bleeding
workers

01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:12.109 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful to members of the
 
01:55:15.530 --> 01:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to have representative
 
01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:16.970 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to have representative
goalie

01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill it and um as I
 
01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
pull it up the multiplier goes from the
 
01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
two percent back up to two and a half
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
percent for the first 20 years and then
 
01:55:37.149 --> 01:55:37.159 align:start position:0%
it goes to the
 
01:55:40.930 --> 01:55:40.940 align:start position:0%
uh after the 20 years goes back to the
 
01:55:44.209 --> 01:55:44.219 align:start position:0%
actual multiplier that's in statute now
 
01:55:47.209 --> 01:55:47.219 align:start position:0%
which is and as I pull it up I'm just
 
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
recalling 2.1 percent for the first two
 
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
or three years and then it incrementally
 
01:55:58.010 --> 01:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
goes up to 2.2 2.3 and 2.4 percent
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
so for the first 20 it increases that
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
multiplier to two and a half percent
 
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
well we're going to need we're going to
 
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
need one more day to work on this anyway
 
01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:28.070 align:start position:0%
need one more day to work on this anyway
um

01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
and we've been here for almost two hours
 
01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
at the moment uh after a session already
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna call the subcommittee
 
01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
meeting for today oh yes representative
 
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:45.410 align:start position:0%
meeting for today oh yes representative
true

01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
but talking about 49. this bill takes a
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
different approach to address the
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.090 --> 01:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't the amendment that we shall not
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
talk of
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
correct all the sins of 2011. so it does
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
something similar but it also adds
 
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
additional benefits for people who
 
01:57:10.729 --> 01:57:10.739 align:start position:0%
didn't fall it's it's not just
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
correcting what happened during that
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
time frame it's also increasing benefits
 
01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
this 449
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
so it goes It goes One Step farther than
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
than what the last spell we were talking
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
about does one fixes the past this one
 
01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
fixes the past
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
to one extent or another and then
 
01:57:36.169 --> 01:57:36.179 align:start position:0%
um addresses things moving forward as
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
well but does 449 correct all the sins
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
of 2011.
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I'm actually not sure
 
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
that it does it get as close as it
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't get as close as the other one
 
01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:58.790 align:start position:0%
doesn't get as close as the other one
does

01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
well yes representative Lucas plus it
 
01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
seems like the other big difference is
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
this one has the employers paying for it
 
01:58:06.169 --> 01:58:06.179 align:start position:0%
the other one is estate paying for it
 
01:58:07.609 --> 01:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
although I understand the concern about
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
whether the state really will pay for it
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm back to where I was
 
01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:20.219 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to suggest that we mold
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
this over for one more meeting
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
review these bills call me with
 
01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.910 align:start position:0%
review these bills call me with
questions

01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
um between now and then so that we can
 
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
be prepared to talk through it in detail
 
01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to rustle up a little
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
bit more information between now and
 
01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
then so that we have that to look at and
 
01:58:35.699 --> 01:58:36.410 align:start position:0%
then so that we have that to look at and
um

01:58:36.410 --> 01:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:39.050 --> 01:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
we'll go from there one quick thing I
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
mean would it actually make sense to
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
pass both of these bills if they're at
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
least in different ways trying to solve
 
01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
the same problem or is that is it one or
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
the other or some melding or something
 
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
um I think you could do both but they do
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
different things and then obviously one
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know one's going to get discarded
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line because you
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
can't have both of them they'd be
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
conflicting that's what I was asking
 
01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
whether they were both whether they were
 
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
conflicted yeah they would be
 
01:59:06.649 --> 01:59:06.659 align:start position:0%
conflicting legislation so they'd have
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
we'd have to pick one at some point okay
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
and and I would assume that would be by
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
Finance by the time it gets there
 
01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we can send two
 
01:59:17.209 --> 01:59:17.219 align:start position:0%
conflicting bills to the Senate
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
yeah uh yes representative O'Brien uh
 
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I do have a
 
01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
question of the chair uh to revert back
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
before I get the impression you may uh
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
call for a recess uh but uh I thought we
 
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
had 571 also in front of us which is the
 
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
cost of living and where a vote was
 
01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
taken uh of uh you know to itl it uh
 
01:59:42.109 --> 01:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
that does leave it open for further
 
01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
motions is that something that the chair
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
wishes to uh um you know what I'll be
 
01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
honest with you I'll be more than happy
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
to get to that today so we can go back
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
to 571. okay thank you Mr chair you're
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for pointing that out
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
my head's in a few different places
 
01:59:58.970 --> 01:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
that's why you have me I appreciate that
 
02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:00.290 align:start position:0%
I knew
 
02:00:00.290 --> 02:00:03.010 align:start position:0%
I knew
[Laughter]

02:00:03.010 --> 02:00:03.020 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
oh okay so back to 571 cost of living
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
adjustments for group two
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize I realized afterwards
 
02:00:13.129 --> 02:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
and this is my first time running a
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so there's a few bumps
 
02:00:16.490 --> 02:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
along the road I didn't ask for further
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
input from the rest of the members
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
before I moved on either so I apologize
 
02:00:23.689 --> 02:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
for that and representative Davis we can
 
02:00:26.089 --> 02:00:26.099 align:start position:0%

02:00:53.689 --> 02:00:53.699 align:start position:0%

at all okay representative Schmidt which
 
02:01:16.850 --> 02:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
I thought we decided that the Ito motion
 
02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
was not where we want to go so we wanted
 
02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
to do something else
 
02:01:23.089 --> 02:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
I am in the same position I was would
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%

02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:05.510 align:start position:0%

um next Wednesday morning although maybe
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday afternoon because we
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
might need a little bit of an additional
 
02:03:24.119 --> 02:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
might need a little bit of an additional
time

02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
