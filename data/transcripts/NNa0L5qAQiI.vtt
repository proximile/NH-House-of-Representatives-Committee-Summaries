ahead
 
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.749 align:start position:0%
ahead
uh

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
I am in favor of itl even though my name
 
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
is one of the sponsors on this bill uh
 
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
when when you get new information in
 
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
life do you stay with the first opinion
 
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
you had or do you change your opinion
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
well I have changed my opinion based on
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh
 
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
the folded ballots can still be counted
 
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
accurately with current electronic
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
ballot counting machines
 
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
when they are used within
 
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.710 align:start position:0%
when they are used within
um

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
when they're used within accordance of
 
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
state law and good practices
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
and I also learned that
 
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
um the new electronic ballot counting
 
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
machines that are being tested
 
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
can solve some of all of the problems
 
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to solve with this
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
legislation so
 
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
that is coming on they're coming online
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
right now at this point and maybe within
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
the next three or four years most
 
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
communities will be using them
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
so uh with that that's why I have
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
the concerns about in expedient to
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
legislate other ones were the large
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
envelopes that I was very concerned that
 
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
would be left unattended at apartment
 
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
complexes the way packages sometimes are
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't want that problem so more
 
00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 align:start position:0%
problems just seemed to pop up and and
 
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we heard and in my
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
conversations with Secretary of State
 
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion
 
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so um I've talked to
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
the people in my town when it comes to
 
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
receiving folded ballots and they
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
actually have to place it uh for hand
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
count after so it does take more time
 
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
the machines kick them out
 
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
um and um I just I think it's worth um
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
not having them folded when they are
 
00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:38.150 align:start position:0%
not having them folded when they are
sent

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
sent
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
it does create problems and keeps people
 
00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
there longer as well and ballots aren't
 
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
being read by the machine properly
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 align:start position:0%
