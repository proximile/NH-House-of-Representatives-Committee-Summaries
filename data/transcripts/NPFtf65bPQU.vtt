00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
open an executive session for health
 
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
human services and elderly affairs
 
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
in case there's anyone in the audience
 
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
from the general population who has
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
never been in an executive session
 
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.470 align:start position:0%
never been in an executive session
before

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
it differs somewhat from a hearing in a
 
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
hearing people come to the witness table
 
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
and speak and sometimes we ask questions
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
in an executive session
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
the visitors
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
are not given the opportunity to speak
 
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
there is one exception to that and that
 
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
is as we are deliberating on a bill if a
 
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
member of the committee
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
would like something clarified by a
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
lobbyist a member of the department and
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
so on with the permission of the chair
 
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
we may call that person up to the table
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
but don't be confused it's not a hearing
 
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
no pink cards and so on but we're glad
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
you're here in any way
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
first up
 
00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 align:start position:0%
we will be taking
 
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 align:start position:0%
house bill 1642
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
we are not necessarily going to do these
 
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
bills in order sometimes we do them
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
because of the availability
 
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.869 align:start position:0%
because of the availability
of

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
individuals with whom we may wish to
 
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.869 align:start position:0%
individuals with whom we may wish to
speak

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
1642 relative to lead testing in
 
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.270 align:start position:0%
1642 relative to lead testing in
children

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
cheer calls on representative canuck to
 
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 align:start position:0%
present his amendment
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh and thank you for
 
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
moving this forward the reason we moved
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
it forward is that ms beverly drewn who
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
is the director of the lead program i'm
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
not quite sure if that's the proper
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
title but was able to be here this
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
morning we went under here in case we
 
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
had any questions so just to review
 
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me yes sir you just moved your
 
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.710 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me yes sir you just moved your
amendment

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
i wasn't sure you said to explain so i
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
thought okay yes i will therefore move
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
amendment number zero two zero two two
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
zero four four three h
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
and second
 
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative woods yes representative
 
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
canarque we've been together for six
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
years you know to listen to what i'm
 
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.749 align:start position:0%
years you know to listen to what i'm
thinking

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
oh yeah my esp wasn't working well
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
anyway so
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
when we i had the hearing i remember the
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
bill initially said i did a couple
 
00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
things that added a lead test in as a
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for daycares for schools and
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
also had some mandatory reporting from
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
providers but we identified that the
 
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
problem is that there was no
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation to cover these these costs
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
so basically what the amendment does is
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
it strips out sections three and four
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
that was the provider stuff
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
it keeps in sections one and two
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
oh by the way to make it easy this is a
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
replace all
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
so you don't need to be going back and
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
forth between the amendment and the bill
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
and figure out what line does what
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
now becomes the bill
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
just to make it easier uh anyway
 
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
so then in the sections one and two
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
which were the school requirement
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
cuts out the reporting because that way
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have to worry about an
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation and it therefore only adds
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
the requirement of a blood level test on
 
00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.830 align:start position:0%
the requirement of a blood level test on
the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
physical examination that goes in for
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
somebody going into the school system
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
and the health forum for child care
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
and this is uh really relatively
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward i should point out
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
i should say what happened and evolved
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
over a period of time here was
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
simplifying this and then getting the
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
child care agencies involved to get
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
their point of view on this
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
and actually also some fqhcs to get
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
their point of view on this
 
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.629 align:start position:0%
their point of view on this
and

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
i also reached out to a number of the
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
physicians who work with the lead
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
program there already is in existence
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire early childhood health
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
assessment record form and it already
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
has on it fields to be filled out by the
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
provider for the blood level tests
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
so it really doesn't add a whole lot of
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
work because that field is there they
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
just have to transfer the number in
 
00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:50.790 align:start position:0%
just have to transfer the number in
now

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
the point of this is that if the child
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
then the child has to have that blood
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
level test for admission
 
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
level test for admission
however

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
you sure don't want somebody to get
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
their one those coveted daycare spots
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
and suddenly not be able to use it
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
because they haven't got a lead test
 
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.029 align:start position:0%
because they haven't got a lead test
done

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
so i also put in uh and you'll notice
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
this language in uh line
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
10 and 11 for school and in 25 and 26
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
for child care that if the child has not
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
had a blood level test at the time of
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
admission they'll be granted six months
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
to remedy the deficiency obviously when
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
they're applying they're going to
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
probably be informed about it so they
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
would have a few more months but still
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
if something happens to open up we don't
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
want to keep somebody out of daycare
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
keeping their parent out of work for
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day they have a an
 
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day they have a an
exemption

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
for a to remedy the deficiency for about
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
six months
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that i
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
sorry my apologies here for a moment oh
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
yes we also changed the age because
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
generally well child checks for the one
 
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:02.150 align:start position:0%
generally well child checks for the one
year

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
begin at about nine months and so
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
on page sorry line 24
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
we changed it from one year to nine
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
months and and also got rid of that
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
language of
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
all children because some children go as
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
early as six weeks and you never test
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
kids that early so the bottom line is
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
the earliest they would be expected
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
would be the nine months
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
and uh again they're exempted for a
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh and it's to remember that there is a
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
an exemption that already exists anyway
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
people do not have to do this they can
 
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
people do not have to do this they can
exempt

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
out of this and that is on line 11
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
and line uh
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
24 25
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
it says unless the child is exempted
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
under rsa 130 a5c that's already in
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
statute the issue is that i wanted to
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate it here so somebody didn't say
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
no you must have it if they are exempted
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
they're exempted they do not have to
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
have this on the form
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
so that's what the amendment does um i
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
did reach out to dr schessler who's the
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
president of new hampshire chapter of
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
the american academy of pediatrics and
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
they support the bills and then did they
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
think this is a very reasonable
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
requirement and agree that it's going to
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
be easy with the form that they have
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
with fields to be filled out
 
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.269 align:start position:0%
with fields to be filled out
so

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and i will just point
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
out that there is a small typo
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
granted and so that that can be fixed by
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
ols either prior to voting on or as an
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
enrolled bill amendment so that we will
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
not be actually grating children for six
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
months yeah sorry i meant to point that
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
out that yeah it's graded they're graded
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
rather than granted we test their blood
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what was that a question sir
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
oh no
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay i must uh
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
cherish uh wishes to
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
ask a question um
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
i think most of my caucus was
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
large expenditure of money on the
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
original bill right
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
thinking that that money
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
would better be spent actually removing
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
that oh yeah
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
so would you speak to the money issue
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
because this could be quite important
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes uh we did have a person who came and
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
testified on that very true but first of
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
all to remember the money issue is gone
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of this amendment
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
because the costs
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
that were in this bill in the fiscal
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
note were the cost to the department
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
to do all of the reporting and all the
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
new databases
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
that's why i removed all this because i
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
knew there was no chance we were going
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
to get an appropriation
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
at this point in time in a non-budgetary
 
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.670 align:start position:0%
at this point in time in a non-budgetary
year

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
for hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
so the point of this is this completely
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
removes the financial issue to begin
 
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.670 align:start position:0%
removes the financial issue to begin
with

00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
how practically would it do that
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
there's no reporting requirement
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
is there someone in the audience uh who
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
can speak to
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
knowledgeably speak to this bill uh on
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
this very question you look oh several
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
yes and once again apologies for the
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
chairs they have the relative height of
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
them has no significance
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
and actually while i'm
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
also in terms of the first part you ask
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
how they're getting up there the cost
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
again there's no money in it but the
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
cost to remediate lead of all of the
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable housing in this state
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
would be somewhere around a billion
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and i'm not sure we're going to
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
be appropriating that either but beverly
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
drewen can speak to that better
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is beverly drewen
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm the administrator of the healthy
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
homes and lead poisoning prevention
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
program i'm here with gail gettings this
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
morning the health outreach coordinator
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
for the program who's a child
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
development specialist get closer to the
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
mic you've asked me to speak about the
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that was associated with
 
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.829 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that was associated with
reporting

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
so currently in the state of new
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire all bloodlet data is reported
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
to the department from the medical
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
providers either the commercial
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
laboratories or the individual provider
 
00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:15.110 align:start position:0%
laboratories or the individual provider
offices

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
offices
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
so in the original bill it had blood
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
lead reporting coming in from the day
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
cares and from the school systems this
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
would have been blood lead data that we
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
already had and it would have been
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
duplicative reporting
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
and there was also portions of the
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that required
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
setting up secure transport mechanisms
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
to transfer system has been
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
removed and therefore the cost of it
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
and therefore the costs associated with
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
any data reporting data storage data
 
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.350 align:start position:0%
any data reporting data storage data
manipulation

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
manipulation
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
any of the data portion okay
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.110 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
canaric

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
canaric
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
in that case the chair calls a recess
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
and asks for 10 minutes for a republican
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.440 --> 00:15:42.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
a5c yeah go ahead if you've got it okay
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
she got it 130 a 5c blood lead testing
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
all parents or guardians should i read
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
the entire thing or just the exemption
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
part exemption
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
a child shall be exempted from this
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
required blood level testing if a parent
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
or legal guardian objects to such
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
testing and provides a statement to such
 
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.389 align:start position:0%
testing and provides a statement to such
effect

00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
or if a physician licensed under rsa 329
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
or a physician exempted under rsa 329 21
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
3 certifies that the blood level test
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
blood level test level testing may be
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the child's health the
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
latter exemption shall only exist for
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
the length of time that in the opinion
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
of the position the testing would be
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the child the
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall develop an opt-out
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
form for the purpose of the section and
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
shall make such a form available to
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
health care facilities the form shall
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
include simple opt-out language in a
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
font and size easily readable by the
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
average adult reader
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
right and again that's so that's already
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
in statute the issue is the only reason
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
i inserted it here because it wasn't
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
initially i wanted to make sure it was
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
clear that this did not supersede that
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
exemption that that exemption still
 
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
exemption that that exemption still
stands

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
stands
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
so the point is parents are mandated to
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
have a blood level test done by age one
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
year and by age two years but our
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
compliance has been rather poor a number
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
of reasons uh part of it cova does not
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
help secondly there was a big recall on
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
the finger stick blood level test
 
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.949 align:start position:0%
the finger stick blood level test
testing

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
device which is what's usually used in
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
the office rather than doing a venous
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
stick if you've ever done a venous stick
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
and a one-year-old is not fun so
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day a lot of them have
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
fallen behind so we understand there's
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
some things that may be fluky but our
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
compliance has not been that good since
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
this one into effect about three years
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
ago or so so the goal is simply to get
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
the compliance up so it's another point
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
of contact where you remind parents and
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
that they need to go get this test done
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
but again this does not supersede the
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else for the representative
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
you may speak one other thing i'm really
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't make it clear the whole
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
point of this amendment as i said was to
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
was to get rid of the appropriation
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
because there was no appropriation so
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the amendment was to cut
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
out everything that cost money so that
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to do that
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
as secretary of state david scanlan says
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
when you're winning you can stop talking
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
it seemed like i failed to make it clear
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
the first time
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
would the clerk call the roll please on

representative leon thank you mr
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
chairman um i did pull up the opt-out
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
form and it's actually quite beautiful
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
um it has a check box that says i choose
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
not to have my child tested for an
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
elevated blood love level and then it
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
has an understanding of exactly what it
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
does and why you might want to have that
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
information there's a similar checkbox
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
for the for the physician and then it
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
has a date patient name parent guardian
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
name signature
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
the attending physician name and
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
signature if necessary and a witness
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
name and witness signature i think it's
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
an elegant solution and i'm glad that's
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
chairman i i'm wondering
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative kanark if you know
 
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.390 align:start position:0%
representative kanark if you know
um

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see any language to require that
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
the form be offered
 
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
the form be offered
or

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
there for it to be disclosed to
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
the parent that they have a right to opt
 
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
the parent that they have a right to opt
out

00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
is there any provision for that well
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
remember the place may i answer
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes that the place where the testing is
 
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.190 align:start position:0%
yes that the place where the testing is
done

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
when you're getting permission to do
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
that is in the provider's office and
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
that's where that form would be offered
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not part of this
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
follow up um
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
do you know if that's routinely offered
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
or is it presented as just something
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done with no option of
 
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done with no option of
declining

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
having not been a pediatrician
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
working at this point perhaps beverly
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
drewen could answer the question as to
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
if she knows but i mean it's
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
this is kind of routine i i really don't
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
think there's any deception going on
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's just people are have that choice
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
may i answer one more i i um
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that and i understand that
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
i just have
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
discomfort with mandating and this is
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
strengthening a mandate by you know
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
adding a new um
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
layer of enforcement where
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're having the schools now
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
ask for this
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
and i just feel
 
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.470 align:start position:0%
and i just feel
that

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know on principle we need to be
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
careful with
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
requiring and mandating things of people
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
especially if there's no
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
assurance that they know that they can
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative canarch well again it's
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
system's been working very well i do not
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
know the number that have exemptions
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
that we have that was actually that
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
reporting was going to be part of the
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
original bill that again was cut because
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
of costs
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
i do not
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
see any pediatricians in the audience
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
who can tell us how they routinely do
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
that that would be an end of one so that
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really help us a whole lot
 
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.350 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really help us a whole lot
but

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.190 align:start position:0%
but
i

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
i assume it's part of their standard
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
their standard work this is so it's not
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
really adding a mandate this is really
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
the mandate's already there
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
um and it has to be reported and it's
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
the law that they have to have it done
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps answer for us if she knows how
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
uh sorry about that so as representative
 
00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:24.950 align:start position:0%
uh sorry about that so as representative
knuck

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
knuck
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned rsa 130a which is the lead law
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
here in the state of new hampshire
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
mandates that a child have a blood lead
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
test at one and again at two years old
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
when a family goes to a health care
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
provider for their well child check
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
they're not only having this finger
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
stick blood lead test
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
but they're having their other
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
immunizations i cannot speak to the
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
workflow in a provider's office because
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not a medical provider
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
but i do know that the opt out is part
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
electronic management record system
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
and that they have those opt-out forms
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
there and families routinely opt out not
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
only of lead poisoning but though that
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
families don't have to fill out a form
 
00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:06.630 align:start position:0%
families don't have to fill out a form
to

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
object to immunizations in the doctor's
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
office so i i just
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
is this something that's routinely
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
you know that they present to the
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
parents when they go for the lead
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
testing oh it's required by state law
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
but we do have
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
um this opt-out form i have three
 
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.350 align:start position:0%
um this opt-out form i have three
children

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.310 align:start position:0%
children
and

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
two of which are
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
under five well five and under and i
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
have never seen that form presented or
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
the option to opt out
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
made clear to me so
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i've had a couple of different
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
pediatricians so i just want i
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
i you know i understand the need for
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
kids to to be lead tested and
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's a good practice and i think the
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
best way to
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
get people to do things is by educating
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
them and i'm just wondering
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
we need this bill because
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot of compliance right
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
so now we're adding
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
um an additional layer where the schools
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
are going to ask for the proof
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
to increase compliance and i just want
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's clear to parents
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
they have a choice
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative cushman i might suggest
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
we deal exactly with the need of this
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
specific bill and perhaps you could file
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
an lsr
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
next september that would mandate
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
doctors to do what you ask
 
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.430 align:start position:0%
doctors to do what you ask
okay

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
canark

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just uh
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
information for the committee
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
um while i'm in favor of this
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
legislation i want to point out that
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
this is a time limited process that over
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
time we will see lead abatement and the
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
problem of lead toxicity will in fact
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
disappear this is not unlike other
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
issues which we face on this committee
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
now there are problems that we are
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislating on that will disappear and
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have statutes on the
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
books that are anachronisms that we have
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
to go back and we have to undo just an
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
awareness please
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
would i ask
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
since the figure of i think a billion
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
dollars was floated to get rid of lead
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
um while i grant there will be abatement
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
with all due respect sir to
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative mckay i don't expect to
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
live long enough to see that happen but
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
he has set an example that one in fact
 
00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:48.390 align:start position:0%
he has set an example that one in fact
can

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
so perhaps sir you will be granted the
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
time to see this problem go away
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
your lips to god's ears perhaps the next
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
generation will deal with the issue of
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
no longer needed and do it with great
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
rejoicing representative woods
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
oh thank you mr chair uh the the testing
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
has two parts it's it's uh preventive
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh and actually allows focused
 
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.950 align:start position:0%
uh and actually allows focused
abatement

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
abatement
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
such that your dollar is being spent for
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
abatement if all the money is spent just
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
on abatement while the the kids that are
 
00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:23.909 align:start position:0%
on abatement while the the kids that are
being

00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
uh exposed that's permanent
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
so though the damage will have already
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
been done
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill is is preventive
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
so that you don't even need that but
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
farther on
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
if the child i mean and this occurs
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
during the first year or two of life and
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's permanent
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
then the state may have a responsibility
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
special educational needs
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
and the trickle down because of that so
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
indeed this is a measure of prevention
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
number one and in fact provides for
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
focused abatement thank you mr chair are
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
you saying that to some degree this
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
actually may save money
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely wow
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative kanark yes
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
but the point is that some old housing
 
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.190 align:start position:0%
but the point is that some old housing
is

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
is actually uh being lived in by old
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
people um since it's a neurologic
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
developmental thing i think if i got
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%

already done
 
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.710 align:start position:0%
already done
wow

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
wow
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
let that be a model
 
00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:06.310 align:start position:0%
let that be a model
one

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
1654 yes we are taking this out of order
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
because the initial uh prime sponsor is
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
in the room and has to get off to
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
king for a motion
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
i would like to move that we
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
do an interim study on this
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
you move interim study
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
that is by representative king who would
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
like to second that representative
 
00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:51.830 align:start position:0%
like to second that representative
soloway

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
soloway
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
and representative king please speak to
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
so over the weekend we we worked on this
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
and i think we came very close
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
um but i think that there's still some
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
language that we still need to work on
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
and uh we
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
we feel that this is a very important
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
we'd just like to have a little bit more
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
chairman um this this is very important
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
and because it may cost a decent amount
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
of money we need to get it right the
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
first time and make sure that if there
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
are any funds which we had heard word of
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that we make use of them in order to
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
provide the best data possible and get
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
this right done right so that we can
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
actually know what's happening in our
 
00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.149 align:start position:0%
actually know what's happening in our
state

00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:43.110 align:start position:0%
state
so

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
this is one of those things that we
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
worked very very hard on i i'm very
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
impressed that we came so close to
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
coming to agreement but we need to get
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
the correct data and as we're working on
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
it it would do a disservice to
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
collect it not quite in the right way or
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
in a more expensive way than we
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise could collect the data because
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
this is very important for public health
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
i am encouraged that in a study we would
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
have more standing to get the cdc
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines to the states on their best
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
practices that they found with the other
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
47 states that do collect these data
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
and by doing that we may be able to have
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
one that perhaps california and maryland
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
can follow our lead once we implement a
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
remember this is an exact session it
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
does not have to be in a form of a
 
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.830 align:start position:0%
does not have to be in a form of a
question

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
we've had good practice at not doing it
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
as a question while we were having
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
hearings so now you can really do it
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
sharings or questions
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%

if
the

00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
access would create a hazard for the
 
00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:32.550 align:start position:0%
access would create a hazard for the
patron

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
patron
 
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.310 align:start position:0%
patron
but

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
the concern that people had was also
 
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.030 align:start position:0%
the concern that people had was also
uh

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
the risk to an employee who might be
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
working alone might have to guard
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
pocketbooks might have
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
other reasons for concern about safety
 
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.390 align:start position:0%
other reasons for concern about safety
so

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
we added risk to the employee as well
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
the second thing we did because we
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
a fine of a thousand dollars is a lot of
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
money to a small business and even a
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
medium-sized small business
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
and we're a little ambiguous about who
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
has to be allowed in and who doesn't
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
so we thought that putting that kind of
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
a fine out there
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
was really unfortunate and so
 
00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.510 align:start position:0%
was really unfortunate and so
uh

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
because misunderstandings happen
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
particularly when people are
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
in urgent need
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
yes we have created a bill that doesn't
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
have any teeth in it
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
but we are urging compliance we hope to
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
use it as a tool for education for the
 
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.390 align:start position:0%
use it as a tool for education for the
public

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i would
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
urge you to adopt the amendment and then
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
adopt the bill and i'd be glad to take
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions for the
 
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.270 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions for the
representative

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
this was the sticky spot as you remember
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
when we first heard it and it looks like
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're unstuck representative acton
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
i have more of a comment um i'd like to
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank the
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair by the way um
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
i would like to thank the prime sponsor
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
for working with uh
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
with us on this the
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
the testimony was was
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
was heart-wrenching where people would
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
be in an emergency in a store
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
and they would be denied and then
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
get into
 
00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.990 align:start position:0%
get into
trouble

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
that couldn't stand but the
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
the fine i felt was too much and so
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
removing that brings me to a point where
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
i support this and and
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
also the idea of of educating and
 
00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.390 align:start position:0%
also the idea of of educating and
communicating

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
communicating
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
and um is is so much better than just
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
compliance just do this
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
so i hope we can start building a way
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
communicate out to the business
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
community out to the various communities
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
than just legislating but this bill i
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
think is a great compromise and i'll be
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative leon thank
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman um and thank you
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative weber for working with me
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
and with us on this to try and find a
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
way to soften this mandate on businesses
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
it is a mandate but it's one that
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enforcement and it allows
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
somebody to if if they need to if they
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
feel unsafe they have a chance to dodge
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
and put that on their employer so
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
they're not saying
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
i would but you look big and scary and
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm all by myself so i believe that by
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
approaching it this way
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
they're able to
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
you're able to still respect the rights
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the aisle those who are
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
about to have a very serious bathroom
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
emergency and those who may
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know there are front line workers
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
they're the people who have been at the
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
face of all of this they've been
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
harassed both sides back and forth with
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
covent the last thing i want to do is
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
pin anything else on them but we can't
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
do that at the expense of these people
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
these people that have a real need
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
so i think that this is a very nice
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
compromise and walks that line um
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
especially because i don't know any
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
other education out um outreach that
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
would be able to make business owners
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
and employees aware of just how critical
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
you should make sure that what you have
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
and by the way many of you will have in
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
your notes this exact information with
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
crossouts on the previous fiscal note we
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
talked about it but here it is in true
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
now representative snow you are
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively simple bill in a
 
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:17.990 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively simple bill in a
way

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
what we're basically it's really three
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
words repeal the suspension is really
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
just by way of background during the
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
last session we passed a bill the senate
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
passed that the governor signed it and
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
it actually became the lead bill in that
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
long list of health care bills that went
 
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.710 align:start position:0%
long list of health care bills that went
in

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
and it basically says that individuals
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
low-income individuals
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
have an income that's somewhat in excess
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
of this threshold for medicaid
 
00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:49.430 align:start position:0%
of this threshold for medicaid
eligibility

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
may become eligible
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm sorry
 
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.710 align:start position:0%
if i'm sorry
oh

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
she was assembling this it wasn't
 
00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:57.430 align:start position:0%
she was assembling this it wasn't
hearing

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.549 align:start position:0%
hearing
that

00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
it gives the department of health and
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
human services the right to look at what
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
goes on and if a person is ongoing
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
and overwhelming medical expenses that
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
they couldn't possibly meet with the
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
current income they have they can
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
qualify for what we call medi in and out
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
medical assistance
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it allows people to then draw on
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
funds from the medicaid account
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that a certain spend down is
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
met to bring them down to that threshold
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
and it's very important because that
 
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.910 align:start position:0%
and it's very important because that
threshold

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
has never been ingested in 30 years it
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
went back to 1990 when that threshold
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
was established and i think we can all
 
00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:39.910 align:start position:0%
was established and i think we can all
agree

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
that the cost of living has changed
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat substantially in the last 30
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
years which leads you to say
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
i move i move that we pass
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%

representative leon thank you mr
chairman

00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
when i look at this i always have the
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
caution about how much we're expanding
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
things but this is one of the areas
 
00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.589 align:start position:0%
things but this is one of the areas
where

00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
not having not having this threshold and
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
not having this in and out
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity keeps people from taking
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
jobs and it keeps them from advancing
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
themselves and moving out of dependency
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
into independence and we need to soften
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
the edges and i think that this softens
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
the edges for people and that's why i'm
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
and as do i for the same reason
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:12.309 align:start position:0%
 
901.

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
the old threshold with less than 150 a
 
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
the old threshold with less than 150 a
week

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
to meet all your expenses
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
this goes somewhat above that but it's
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
still not living in luxury
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%

00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
if you do not want it on consent you
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
will have to argue it from the floor
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
if you're prepared to do that
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
or do you or do the two no votes wish to
 
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
or do you or do the two no votes wish to
wonder

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.589 align:start position:0%
in this legislation it's been a long
journey

00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
the

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements so forth were
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
worked out in a bill
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
and were part of the negotiated
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
agreement that was voted on and made
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
into law
 
00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:02.630 align:start position:0%
into law
and

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
i found out the hard way in the past
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
because basically i do support a lot a
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
lot of the
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid program and i've proven that in
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
the past with my voting
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
but one thing i've learned my lesson is
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
to not undo
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
the negotiated
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
settlements that lead to legislation
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
in the next year or two i think that has
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
a corrosive effect on
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate in the future when you just
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
try to change it the next year or the
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's a positive way of
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
legislating so therefore i oppose this
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
begrudgingly oppose this thank you thank
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
yes this is just a question um
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure um representative what
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
you're referring to in terms of a
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
previous negotiated um
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
program the current
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
statute for
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
managing the
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility that we're about to change
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
was negotiated
 
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.789 align:start position:0%
was negotiated
previously

00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
be referring to several years ago in the
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
house when we first looked at medicaid
 
00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:21.990 align:start position:0%
house when we first looked at medicaid
expansion

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
numbers of people including myself who
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
were inclined to vote no
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
voted yes because there was
 
00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.109 align:start position:0%
voted yes because there was
a

00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
sort of courteous understanding that we
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't keep being pushed on this i i
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
think is that what you mean exactly i i
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for that um
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
negotiation but i
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
but that's exactly what i mean it was
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
also the same issue with the the work
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that we tried to change
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh that was negotiated that brought on a
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
lot of votes and it caused the passage
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.270 align:start position:0%
of the bill
to

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
to then change that
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
a year or two down the road undermines
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
the original agreement so
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro may follow up yes
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposed does not
 
00:56:07.839 --> 00:56:10.150 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposed does not
specifically

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
refer to expanded medicaid or the
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
granted advantage program it refers to
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid in general
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's actually taking a federal option
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's been there for years and years
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
to add a very small number of
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant and minor immigrants
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
that was negotiated um you know for a
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
five-year period
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
well that's the the agreement
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
of that five-year waiting period was
 
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.069 align:start position:0%
of that five-year waiting period was
is

00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
something that has been the standard for
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
many years
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
and that's something that the people of
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and through the legislator
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
legislature has agreed upon so in this
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
current environment to change that i
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay i have i have several points to
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
make to all of that um
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
first of all i i second the point about
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro that this is
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
traditional medicaid it's not expanded
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid it's an option that has been
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
we make changes all the time in the
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
legislature we have negotiated
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
agreements all the time in the
 
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.510 align:start position:0%
agreements all the time in the
legislature

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
and adding something that didn't was not
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
part of the original agreement
 
00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:49.190 align:start position:0%
part of the original agreement
shouldn't

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
be an issue here
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
we all know that it is a
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle of legislation
 
00:57:57.599 --> 00:57:58.470 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle of legislation
that

00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
the actions of one legislature do not
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
bind the next legislature and i cannot
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
tell you how many carelessly
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
negotiated and carefully worked out
 
00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.870 align:start position:0%
negotiated and carefully worked out
agreements

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
that i have seen
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
and participated in have been undone by
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
the next legislature without any concern
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
whatsoever for the agreements that were
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
made earlier so that's one issue
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
the second issue is that if we value the
 
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.589 align:start position:0%
the second issue is that if we value the
lives

00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
of our unborn citizens
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
and if we value the lives
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
of our youngest
 
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.870 align:start position:0%
of our youngest
citizens

00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
because these children will be born here
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
and they will be citizens and their
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
parents are in the country legally
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
but they're whether they're citizens or
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
not they're children and if we value the
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
lives of children would we not want to
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
give them the very best possible start
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
in this world by giving them the best of
 
00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.190 align:start position:0%
in this world by giving them the best of
preventive

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
preventive
 
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.950 align:start position:0%
preventive
and

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
well-child care in their earliest years
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
because we know that if we do not do so
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
we are being
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
very penny wise and exceedingly pound
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
foolish because
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
when they show up in an emergency room
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
they will receive treatment
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
and it will be paid for by the taxpayers
 
00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.510 align:start position:0%
and it will be paid for by the taxpayers
so

00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
of cure and i will be voting against the
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
itl thank you mr chairman
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leon
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
when we heard this bill i definitely
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
heard i felt for all of these families
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
but both of the cases that were brought
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
to us had one thing in common um they
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
they had declared amnesty but that
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
amnesty was after a immigrant detention
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
which means that when they entered they
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
weren't declaring amnesty
 
01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:02.870 align:start position:0%
weren't declaring amnesty
i

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
i would be interested in seeing a much
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
more narrowly crafted one where we're
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
respecting those that when they set foot
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
here say i am here for help i am the
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
poor the unwashed the needy who have
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
reached out to the united states in
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
order to find hope
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh extending it to those who declare
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
i i think what would be a reasonable
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
compromise but that's that's such a
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
large thing to do it's not something we
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
can rewrite in an early bill
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
i feel for these families but i also
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
fled a state where compassion is
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
bankrupting the health care system and
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
at a certain point you have to
 
01:00:37.119 --> 01:00:38.549 align:start position:0%
at a certain point you have to
understand

01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
what costs people can bear
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
what cost people should bear and as you
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
start opening more and more things up it
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
just keeps growing
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
and right now there's in my in my birth
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
state i won't call it my home state
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire is my home now and
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
forever but in my birth state there
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
there's problems with access to care
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
because it's been opened up so wide
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
i can't support something that that's
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
crafted so wide that once you're caught
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
then suddenly you qualify for care i i
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
think that crafting it more narrowly so
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
when you come here asking for help as
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
soon as you enter that's the sort of
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
thing that we can reach out to first and
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
see what the impact is
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative snow i maybe my memory
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes plays tricks but it's my
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
recollection that people who arrive in
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
the united states as refugees already
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
qualify for medicaid coverage for some
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
am i correct about that i believe i am
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
is anybody here that can answer that
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
so in essence what we're doing is we're
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
not changing the law we're simply
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
broadening it to include other people
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
who are legally
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
here but not as refugees but green cards
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so for a little
 
01:02:02.799 --> 01:02:04.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so for a little
background

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative snow is correct people
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
who come
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
through one of the resettlement agencies
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
as vetted refugees from refugee camps
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
and other places in the world
 
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.470 align:start position:0%
and other places in the world
come

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.390 align:start position:0%
come
with

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.349 align:start position:0%
with
full

01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
full federal benefits available to them
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
um and as an example the afghan evacuees
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
who 60 000 have come in
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
recent months they are not full-fledged
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
refugees but they've given been given
 
01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:37.270 align:start position:0%
refugees but they've given been given
expedited

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
expedited
 
01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.150 align:start position:0%
expedited
um

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
status so that they that all of this
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
will be available to them
 
01:02:42.319 --> 01:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
will be available to them
um

01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
i think you probably were referring to
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
asylum seekers rather than amnesty
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
um i may be incorrect but
 
01:02:53.599 --> 01:02:55.589 align:start position:0%
um i may be incorrect but
um

01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
possibly it's uh about the terms but but
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
the question is is intent on entry right
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
so um asylum seekers are people who
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
request asylum in this country
 
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.589 align:start position:0%
request asylum in this country
because

01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
going back to their
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
home country
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
will involve some kind of serious
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
persecution and they have to pass a
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
credible fear interview which starts off
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
and then they have to make a long
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
application with um information about
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
the persecution that they experienced
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
and frequently those
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
final hearings to declare whether they
 
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.829 align:start position:0%
final hearings to declare whether they
get

01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
um asylum or not takes
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
um one of the lawyers said 10 or 15
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
years i've heard more like
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
two or three years but i guess it varies
 
01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:54.549 align:start position:0%
two or three years but i guess it varies
um

01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
but i think none of us would say
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
that the immigration system as is works
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
um well
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's something we could all
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
agree on that the immigration system as
 
01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
agree on that the immigration system as
is

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
does not work well
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
things are always changing things are
 
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.309 align:start position:0%
things are always changing things are
transient

01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
transient
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
people make application for
 
01:04:20.799 --> 01:04:21.990 align:start position:0%
people make application for
asylum

01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
asylum
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
people get sent to detention and it's
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
not always so logical
 
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.309 align:start position:0%
not always so logical
um

01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
i i guess my point is
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm really disappointed and i
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know as
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative weber alluded to i think
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
we have real heartfelt differences on
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
certain issues i'm wading into shark
 
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
infested waters here i'm talking about
 
01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.870 align:start position:0%
infested waters here i'm talking about
abortion

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
but i thought we had really broad
 
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.470 align:start position:0%
but i thought we had really broad
support

01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.750 align:start position:0%
support
for

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
people who are pregnant and want to
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
bring children into the world
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
people who are children and who are
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
vulnerable who don't have money
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
i thought i thought there was very broad
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
support on this
 
01:05:10.079 --> 01:05:11.109 align:start position:0%
support on this
committee

01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
to support those people who wanted to
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
make a go of it in this country
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
i think we're losing sight of what's
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
really important here
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
there are two individuals
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about one's the
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
mother who could be here illegally
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
whatever status may be
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
the other one's the child
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's the fetus that which she carries
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that child ultimately will become a
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
u.s citizen
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
so therefore are we shooting ourselves
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the void because we're not making the
 
01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.670 align:start position:0%
in the void because we're not making the
investment

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
in that child
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
which may come out
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
with all kinds of concerns we talk about
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
lead testing and so forth probably
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
they're living in a house with lead in
 
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.710 align:start position:0%
they're living in a house with lead in
it

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
should we try to find a way to make that
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
an investment not an expense but an
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
investment in that child so they become
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
a productive citizen of the state
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
who can contribute to the state
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
not focus on the mother and the status
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
of the mother i'd ask you to focus on
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
the child
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
who is soon to become a u.s citizen and
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
have all the rights
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
of a u.s citizen
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
that they're entitled to including
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
health care in medicaid
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not so much i look at this as an
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
expense but rather
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
an investment that we make into that
 
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.349 align:start position:0%
an investment that we make into that
child

01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
so they in fact do become a productive
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
citizen of our state
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
i saw representative connerk
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to uh comment a little
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
bit about the agreement on sb 313 which
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
was the medicaid reauthorization in 18.
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
i spent countless hours on this the
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
triumvirate of jess edwards bill marsh
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
and i brought forward 10 amendments on
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
that bill when we came through our
 
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.789 align:start position:0%
that bill when we came through our
committee

01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
um and yes the work requirement was a
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
really big compromise and that's why i
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
voted against representative mc williams
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
bill two years ago because i did not
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
think we should go back on our
 
01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.950 align:start position:0%
think we should go back on our
compromise

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
but i don't recall the issue of
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh asylum seekers
 
01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.710 align:start position:0%
uh asylum seekers
or

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
people who are refugees
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
while refugees already kind of
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
asylum seekers being a big bone of
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
contention or a bargaining chip on that
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh that was the work requirement so
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
i don't feel bound by the
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
work we did in 2018 though i do in
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
principle do and that's why
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
i did not vote against the work
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
requirement i voted against the broker
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
requirement appeal when it came up
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
because i wanted to honor the
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
requirement so i think that
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
representatives comments i think
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't drive it i think it more
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
important is that issue of an investment
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
in the future by keeping kids healthy
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
and if
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative weber said
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
kids get sick they're going to show up
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
in the uw
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation we're not going to
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
tell them i'm sorry
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
we're not going to treat you because
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
you're the wrong person we're going to
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
take care of them and that that cost is
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to come straight from the taxpayer
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
at a much higher cost than it would if
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative nada upham
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
well call me sentimental but i'm in
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
favor of taking care of pregnant women
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
and children no matter where they're
 
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.990 align:start position:0%
and children no matter where they're
from

01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
i've been the recipient when i lived in
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
england for a year of having
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
a pregnancy emergency and a doctor came
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
and did a house call to my little
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
apartment and charged me nothing and i
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
said oh i should pay something i mean
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
they have universal health care
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that helps but
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of voting for this bill
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
this is accessing
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
a federal program
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
that is taking up some of the cost
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
and this isn't going to be hundreds of
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
thousands of people i mean i think this
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
is going to be a small sampling of
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's gonna break our
 
01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's gonna break our
bank

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
bank
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i appreciate this
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
dialogue and thank you for letting me
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
know that refugees are already covered
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'm delighted to know that because
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
because that's the right thing to do
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
i i'm not i'm trying i need to we need
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
to balance the compassion
 
01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.829 align:start position:0%
to balance the compassion
for

01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
all of these families that are starting
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
out i speak to so many families that are
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
on the bubble they're on the cusp every
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
single increase is the sort of thing
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
where they're choosing between
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
more hours away from their kids or what
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
kind of food they're putting on the
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
table especially with this
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
incredible inflation that we're seeing
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
right now they're just they're having to
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
balance gas and this is the sort of
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
thing that impacts our other families
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
where they are also bringing children
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
into the world and considering whether
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
they will and
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
possibly choosing not to even after the
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
pregnancy has started because they can't
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
afford that child
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
our compassion for one group of people
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
can't be at the expense of others and i
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
do know that we have us we have charity
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
care and we need to make sure that that
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
it does remain robust
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
when it's a small group of people
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
we can as a community reach out and help
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
them and we do have ways ways to do that
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
i i just can't let compassion for one
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
small group of people end up
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
increasing the costs on these other
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
families that are working so hard
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
they're on the bubble and they're
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
already dealing with inflation we
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
haven't seen at least in my lifetime
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
and the idea of expanding this when
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
expanding this in in such a way i
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
realize there's federal funds but those
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't come without state funds
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
and we are also all federal taxpayers as
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
well and our families that are strapped
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
that may not be as privileged as you and
 
01:10:55.199 --> 01:10:55.990 align:start position:0%
that may not be as privileged as you and
i

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
they feel every one of these increases
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
and it it impacts how they care for
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
their children it impacts their prenatal
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
nutrition in their own pregnancies and
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
we can't we can't be blind to those
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
costs too and that that that's why i do
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
remain against this and i do see that as
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
an issue of compassion because we can
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
still provide
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
charity care we still can reach out to
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
these families that's something that
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
this country has long done reaching out
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
to those who need help on an individual
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
basis and not always sticking it on
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
their neighbors who might not afford it
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the heart and the
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
compassion on both sides i appreciate
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
the prenatal needs
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
but i just can't put this on my
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
both the refugee and this new bill does
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
put time limits on how long that
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
benefits last
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
and in this bill it says
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
the mother is covered through her
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and the postpartum period
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
which now is 60 days and if we pass that
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
other bill it'll be 12 months that
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
they'd be coming and then it stops but
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
these things are built in because it's
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
expected that people that receive these
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
benefits will be motivated to move
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
towards becoming more self-sufficient in
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
earning those benefits not
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
accepting them as gifts
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
same thing with the refugees i don't
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
know exactly what the time limit is but
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
i know that the refugees have
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
for some i don't know how many months it
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
is but they have a time limit on how
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
long they can go and they need to find a
 
01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.630 align:start position:0%
long they can go and they need to find a
way

01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
to find insurance or an alternative way
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
you you have to look at the fact that
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
this is also a motivator
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
to move people towards independence
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's really
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
the road back
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes um i know we can all read but um i
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
just would like to make the point that
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
four hundred and forty thousand dollars
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
a year half of which will be covered by
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
um the federal government which is two
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty thousand dollars a
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
year to make a real difference in
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
in a significant number of people's
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
lives um and um in their starting off in
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
once again i would just say that it's
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 220 000 in state
 
01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.070 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 220 000 in state
funds

01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.669 align:start position:0%
funds
representative

01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up to that i'd like to
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
point out that one of the most important
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
things that we see with good prenatal
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
care is the prevention of premature
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
birth and a premature birth let's say
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
two months early and in the nicu for
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps 30 days or so the cost of that
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
is about five times that's one
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
one child the cost that would be about
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
five times the cost of this entire bill
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
and guess what
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
no one's going to throw that child out
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
in the dumpster because they don't have
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
insurance because they're the wrong
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
person we're going to take care of them
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay the bill
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's actually we are losing money if we
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
don't pass this
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
prenatal care is extremely important
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
well all of you who are females in this
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
room have had the luxury if you have
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
children of having probably good
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
prenatal care
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
and you know how important that is and
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
we do know that maternal mortality
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
is higher with poor prenatal care
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
but if you don't care about the
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
immigrants okay that's fine but at least
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
the kids who are u.s citizens
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's the other group that suffers a
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
good friend of mine had her child at
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
about 28 months and was in the nicu for
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
and i was involved in some of the costs
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
that she had to face trying to help her
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
with that 28 weeks sorry
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
hypothetical

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
at fort mccoy in wisconsin we have
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
upwards of 80 000 afghan refugees
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
many many of whom are pregnant women
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
coming into the country they will be
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
settling in among other places new
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire this is simply insurance that
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
we can take care of these people
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
preventively now so that we're not
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
paying for them in
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
much larger amounts of money later this
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not sure the
 
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.990 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not sure the
courtesy

01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
courtesy
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
involved what currently do we have the
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill that you was just referred to
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
that if we pass this other bill it will
 
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
that if we pass this other bill it will
extend

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
extend
 
01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.229 align:start position:0%
extend
from

01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
postpartum it will extend postpartum to
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
12 months
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
what what is the comparison of that bill
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
to this bill what's different
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
yes these are
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
two completely separate bills so this
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
would cover approximately
 
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.229 align:start position:0%
would cover approximately
300

01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
300
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
people in various immigration statuses
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
who are pregnant or children and it
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
would make them it would
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
remove a five-year wait
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
which they currently have to be eligible
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
for medicaid
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
the other bill that you're talking about
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
which is completely separate
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
but which will be coming up today will
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
be one that
 
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.790 align:start position:0%
be one that
extends

01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
extends
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
postpartum benefits from what is
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
currently 60 days to a full year
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
and that is a that is a different bill
 
01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
and that is a that is a different bill
um

01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
it might affect some of the people who

amendment would anybody care to
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%

representative gay or representative
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
leon well
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
both not at the same time
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
the act as you can see
 
01:43:28.239 --> 01:43:29.109 align:start position:0%
the act as you can see
um

01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
the right of privacy was what was the
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
motivation for this
 
01:43:33.119 --> 01:43:34.070 align:start position:0%
motivation for this
uh

01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
rewrite of the bill
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
and people did not when they were
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
given immunizations in particular were
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
not notified that they could opt out of
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
being registered in the registry so this
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
just this was an attempt to think of the
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
least expensive way to notify people
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
that they could now opt out
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
i don't remember if everybody even saw
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
amendment this just simply changed the
 
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
wording to be used in the notification
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
because the in the original amendment
 
01:44:16.239 --> 01:44:17.109 align:start position:0%
because the in the original amendment
it's

01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:18.639 align:start position:0%
used more and
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
the sort of language we were expected to
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
be able to read but the public really
 
01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.310 align:start position:0%
be able to read but the public really
isn't

01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.189 align:start position:0%
isn't
so

01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh my amendment was simply to simplify
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
the wording
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh there was nothing to matter with the
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
the previous wording it just was a
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
little more
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
collegiate so we say than
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
so the wording
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
changed to
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire obtained your
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
private health information without
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
offering you a chance to opt out that's
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
lines up that's on page two
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
constitution honors your right to
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
privacy including your medical
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
information and you have the right to
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
withdraw your information and then it
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
would include a link
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
so they could go to the
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
dhhs website to easily find it
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
i would just say that having having
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
reviewed the amendment uh i appreciate
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh that people have addressed the
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
concerns of those of us who do want to
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
voluntarily have our
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
information continue in the registry and
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
that nothing has interfered with that
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
but i certainly support the right of
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
anybody who wishes to remove their
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
information to do so so i appreciate the
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
work that's been done on the bill
 
01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:46.629 align:start position:0%
work that's been done on the bill
representative

01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
and i do too completely but i do have a
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
question the statement uh reliance on
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
page two lines one through
 
01:45:59.590 --> 01:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh five or four talk about the campaign
 
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
shall inform the public that blah blah
 
01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:02.709 align:start position:0%
shall inform the public that blah blah
blah

01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
blah
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
got it
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
but can the wording have other
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
explanations because if i saw that i
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
would have no idea what it's talking
 
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
about it doesn't say anything about the
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry that it was it just
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
says you have your private health
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
information a person might think this is
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
their entire medical record that
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
suddenly got shipped off to the state by
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
accident i'm assuming this is
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
shall include this
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
shall at least include this and there
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
can be more explanation i would hope
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct is that correct
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes you make a good point but i mean but
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
is that correct because i mean the
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
reading here the wording doesn't say
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
shall inform them only that
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's so that is clear that it can be
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
more i should trust the department to
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
know that thank you
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
because it's always it's also important
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to tell them
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
that this is the only place that that
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
record exists so it's important that
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
more information be given that's i
 
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
should make sure they could do that
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative soloway thank
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i would simply like to
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
note with high praise the inclusion on
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
line 10
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
of the sentiment endorsed by our
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
constituents and individuals right to be
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
free from governmental intrusion in
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
private or personal information is
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent and that
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
must be a guiding principle for this
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
committee it will show up again later
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.990 align:start position:0%
today thank you
merchant

01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the authors of the
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um it does the move this
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
clarify a lot of things for me the way i
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
read this if i'm correct it eliminates
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note kind of like we did
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
before with one of the other bills
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's not
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
an attachment for appropriations to
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish this is that correct number
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
two one of the things is more for
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
clarification having been on the board
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
of pharmacy for 10 years
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
when you put something in statute it's
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
very difficult for a department to
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
change the statute
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying they can't but the way
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's worded right now because the
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
language is very specific in the statute
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
i think it will cause confusion because
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
it will have to say public
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
health information and not specifically
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines so
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to derail the amendment
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
but just bring it to people's attention
 
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
that when a statute is very clear that
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
all of this discussion that we're having
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
here the idea is to make sure that we
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
can get this word out in the most cost
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
effective manner and by using the power
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
of social media press releases and
 
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
making this easy to find on the website
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think we can get from here to there um
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
i do know that i had been able to
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
i wasn't able to find the opt out until
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
it was emailed to us so
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's why as we were working on this
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
amendment it was so important to say
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
that it needed to be prominent that it
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
needed to have those banners for that
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
time period because
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm really good at searching online and
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
i still couldn't do it
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate some of these
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
updates to language
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
the idea of perhaps specifically saying
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
that it's regard to the covet
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination during a certain time period
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that's something that
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
we might want to look at a little bit
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
more and see if we can refine it before
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
the before the clock runs out today
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i wonder if before he sneaks
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
out the door back there we could inquire
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
of mr williams from the department
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
mr williams from the department uh could
 
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
we inquire of mr williams from the
 
01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:41.270 align:start position:0%
we inquire of mr williams from the
department

01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
whether he felt the language
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
that is included here
 
01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.350 align:start position:0%
that is included here
would

01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
preclude the department have you seen
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
lines two through four
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:04.149 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
but

01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
of page two
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.159 --> 01:50:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear it okay we are now on page
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
two we are on lines two to four and i'm
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
now going to ask my question
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
you are mandated by this statute to
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
include the the language there
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
but by mandating that that be included
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
prevent you from putting
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
a banner headline on all of the
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
information you send out saying
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
notice regarding the covid vaccine
 
01:50:45.199 --> 01:50:47.350 align:start position:0%
notice regarding the covid vaccine
registry

01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
and putting any other
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
explanatory information in here as long
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
as these words and the hyperlink to the
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
current form is included is that correct
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
um chairman pearson that would be the
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
department's read of that language that
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
it would allow at a minimum that we
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
would have to include this but certainly
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
could be more expansive for clarity's
 
01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
sake with with the public uh certainly
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
if the committee wanted to entertain a
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
further amendment on that issue they
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
could but i think given your read and my
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
read of this that we don't need a
 
01:51:21.589 --> 01:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
further amendment on that section we do
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the very hard work
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
particularly by resident leon and also
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
representative gay and the committee on
 
01:51:28.719 --> 01:51:29.589 align:start position:0%
representative gay and the committee on
and

01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
represent cushman thank you um
 
01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.030 align:start position:0%
represent cushman thank you um
for

01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
taking a bill that obviously had
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
significant issues for the department
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
and turning it into something that
 
01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.629 align:start position:0%
and turning it into something that
certainly

01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
more clearly addresses what i think the
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
committee's vision was around it however
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
with that said because i feel the
 
01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
pressure of two wonderful people sitting
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
next to me there is a cost associated
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
with this it's not as big as obviously
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
the cost associated with the bill as
 
01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:54.149 align:start position:0%
the cost associated with the bill as
introduced

01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
i do think you made big efforts not to
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
include a mass mailing so i personally
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh not personally my in my capacity as
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
director of legislation appreciate that
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
effort but i'm going to um ask uh with
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
the with the okay of the uh chair of the
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
committee if dr turalek could just
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
comment briefly because she's done
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
similar uh campaigns uh involving
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
public health and she can give you at
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
least an idea of what the cost may be
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
even though i have a feeling we may be
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
going a little far afield in our
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
conversation but just we'd be remiss if
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't mention that uh because we
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want it to be a surprise when
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
the bill moves along in the process so
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
i would like doctor
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
welcome back thank you uh just for the
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
record my name is uh dr sai chiralla i'm
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
the bureau chief for the population
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
health uh based on this read when you
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
talk about some of the public campaign
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
most of them do cost there is a cost
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
associated with that kind of work and
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
when you're thinking about expanding
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of information across the new
 
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire whether we talk about social
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
media or others there is a cost
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
associated some of the campaigns similar
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
to that things we have done would be
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
around a quarter million dollars and i
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
understand there is a fiscal note not
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
associated with this so we want to think
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
about that cost association for that and
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
have a consideration from the committee
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
on how do we do that with the with
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
respect to what the committee wants us
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
if it were the intended committee to
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
utilize existing resources to do exactly
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to have us to do
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh in recognition of the fact that it
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
may not be as robust as maybe other
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
campaigns that have done that have been
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
funded uh we just want to place that out
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
there uh for for your consideration
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
um i because i was amending a bill on an
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that was already there
 
01:53:50.639 --> 01:53:51.430 align:start position:0%
amendment that was already there
as

01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
in my previous life
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
evaluating gui's gui graphical user
 
01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:59.430 align:start position:0%
evaluating gui's gui graphical user
interface

01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
interface
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
we tried to make things as
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
as intuitive as possible i didn't write
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
that into here but my intention was that
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
after we had testimony that said you can
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
find the vaccine registry online and
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
then some skilled people couldn't find
 
01:54:17.119 --> 01:54:18.310 align:start position:0%
then some skilled people couldn't find
it

01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:19.030 align:start position:0%
it
the

01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
software may be half built at least
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
already on the website that does have
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
the vaccine registry on it
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
not totally ready obviously so we forgot
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
about that costing
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
um but what it would be i envisioned of
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
just a little bar on the front uh
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
the home page that would say vaccine
 
01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.189 align:start position:0%
the home page that would say vaccine
registry

01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
and you clicked on that and there's all
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
more information on vaccines i'm sure
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of information about
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
vaccines one of the options would be
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
to opt out of the kofi
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
so i didn't write any of that into
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
into my modification and again we we do
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
believe that you've been very thoughtful
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
in your approach here and i think you
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
tried to design this in a way to
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
effectuate the notice to the public
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
around the opportunity to uh having that
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
removed from the registry
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
the concern and just hearing from dr
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
chirala is under similar campaigns there
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
have been a cost associated with it
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll just if there is no
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
appropriation we'll do the best we can
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh with no appropriation but it would be
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
always helpful to consider
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
the possibility of actually funding this
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
if needed to making sure that it is a
 
01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:33.109 align:start position:0%
if needed to making sure that it is a
robust

01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
robust
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
campaign which i think that's what the
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee's intent is representative
 
01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:41.109 align:start position:0%
committee's intent is representative
weber

01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
i have a question for clarification from
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
the drafters of the amendment based on
 
01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:46.870 align:start position:0%
the drafters of the amendment based on
the

01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
comments from the department
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
and my question has to do with the
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one and the top of page
 
01:55:54.639 --> 01:55:55.830 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one and the top of page
two

01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
on line thirty of page one it says a
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
notice or banner promptly displayed on
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
all websites operated by the department
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
for use by the general public
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
for not less than 60 days
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if that might be
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
over broad and burdensome
 
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.350 align:start position:0%
over broad and burdensome
on

01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
the department if every single
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
site for every single division has to
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
post this or whether the intent
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
was to tie it specifically
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
to just
 
01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
the front page of the department's
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
overall website
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
presumably follow-up links on the parts
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
of the website that deal with
 
01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:49.189 align:start position:0%
of the website that deal with
vaccinations

01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
01:56:49.199 --> 01:56:51.030 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
i

01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
i wonder if we could clarify
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
whether this would require a notice on
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
the front page of the division of elder
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
services and the division of dcyf and
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
i mean it says all websites so i'm a
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
little worried about what that means and
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
where where you actually want it and
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
what the department is required to do
 
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
the chair is asking uh
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative leon the meaning of the
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
word all here
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um the intent with
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
this is to make it so that when people
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
are interacting with the department
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
website it it is something that they see
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to a top level
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
page or they're going to one of the
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
programs within it
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
if you think back to the earlier days of
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
the pandemic there was a very small
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
pop-up at the top of all of the
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
department all the new hampshire
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
websites that gave the link to those
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
coveted resources
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
by having something that applies across
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
the entire domain it actually
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
i've only done really small websites so
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
people who have done larger ones let me
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
know but by applying a pop-up to
 
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
anything within a certain domain i've
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
i've been led to believe it's easier
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
than trying to figure out which pages
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
would get it so by having simply a
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
pop-up that expires after a certain
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
amount of time it actually appeared to
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
be a less burdensome one than trying to
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
insert it into
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
the side panel of each one of these
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
different groups because they don't have
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
the same format you'd have somebody
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
going in and inserting it and when you
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
do that i'm really good at breaking
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
computers and i know it can break those
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
websites so the idea of having that
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
option of that pop-up banner that then
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
lets people know that they have that
 
01:58:34.719 --> 01:58:35.990 align:start position:0%
lets people know that they have that
option

01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
it would get it in front of eyeballs
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the burden and we weren't looking
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
for a campaign like the one i saw last
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
night about getting your shot and
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
getting boosted that is a very huge
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
campaign and a very very expensive one
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
by putting out a press release that then
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity to get picked up and
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
by putting out at least one post on
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
social media it would allow that to
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
circulate through those different
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
through those different mechanisms where
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
people are having this communication and
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
by doing this it shows that this is
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
coming from the department but is
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
intended to reduce that burden because
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
the press release
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
should be something that's relatively
 
01:59:17.599 --> 01:59:18.790 align:start position:0%
should be something that's relatively
routine

01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
routine
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
um posting on the social media account i
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
do know that there are posts um
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
fortunately they don't spend their whole
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
day like some of the police departments
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
or wendy's that like to interact with
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
the public so thank you
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh but but those do go out there and i i
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if it'd be correct to
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
assume that press releases also go out
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
onto the social media accounts and if so
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
then if that's the case i'm sorry can i
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
respond to that question yes sure um yes
 
01:59:47.109 --> 01:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
we do do press releases if you're
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
looking at that kind of an information
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
press release social media post or even
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
putting on our website wouldn't be a
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
cost factor but when you talk about a
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
public campaign just remember we are
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
from public health for us campaigns is
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
across the public so we are thinking you
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
know the bigger the boost kind of thing
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
but if you're looking at that kind of a
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
smaller thing that would be something
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we could we would be able to do
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
that but maybe the language has to be
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
modified in the amendment to focus
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
saying that these are the areas that we
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
are asking the department to do not a
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
public campaign so that's where we are
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
want to clarify
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
is there another word that would be more
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
limited than campaign to use on page one
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
line twenty nine
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh those public information campaign
 
02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:39.030 align:start position:0%
uh those public information campaign
notification

02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:44.310 align:start position:0%
 
endeavor

02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative connerk was next
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
we all we have the experts up here just
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
a quick question because we did receive
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
some federal federal funds to help us
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
with vaccination
 
02:00:56.709 --> 02:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
and this is sort of part of our
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
vaccination thrust could some of those
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
federal funds be applied to to pay the
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
costs for this because
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
um the notification
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
about the opt-out is really sort of part
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
of our vaccination program would that be
 
02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:15.270 align:start position:0%
of our vaccination program would that be
allowable

02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a very good question we do
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
have some federal funds but they're
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
focused on expanding the reach of the
 
02:01:21.119 --> 02:01:22.550 align:start position:0%
focused on expanding the reach of the
vaccinations

02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
so we have to go back and look and talk
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
to our federal partners on that and if i
 
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
could add the word campaign maybe the
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
word outreach might be in a very
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the hopes that we don't have to
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
redraft this again
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
may i point out that what it says here
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
is that the campaign shall at a minimum
 
02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:52.149 align:start position:0%
is that the campaign shall at a minimum
include

02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
a press release the posting on the
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
social media account and the notice or
 
02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:58.229 align:start position:0%
social media account and the notice or
banner

02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
banner
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you can do that
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
you have met the minimum
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
and there is no further requirement for
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
a campaign
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
that is more
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
than the minimum so
 
02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:16.149 align:start position:0%
than the minimum so
if

02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
would it be okay under those
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances to keep
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
um i would make the suggestion
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
respectfully of changing the word
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
campaign to outreach i think it
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
addresses dr terala's concerns regarding
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
how public health views the word
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
campaign and then i think it brings
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
clarity to the remainder of the language
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you just change that one word
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
if it's a if it's amenable to
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
um we would just make that suggestion
 
02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:47.910 align:start position:0%
um we would just make that suggestion
respectfully

02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and if we are
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
going to be changing that from campaign
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
to outreach
 
02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.350 align:start position:0%
to outreach
um

02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
is it the
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
i just want to get a general feel if
 
02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
adding in that first pair first line of
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
the notice to read the state of new
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire obtained your private health
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
information when you receive the covet
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
19 vaccination without offering you a
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
chance to opt out so that it's clear
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
that it's just for that
 
02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:19.270 align:start position:0%
that it's just for that
uh

02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
are we lurching our way towards an
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative kenner
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
fair enough although again i think that
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
still would be
 
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
could prone to misinterpretation it
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
would you'd be saying during the copen
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine they obtained your public health
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
information your information and that
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
person might still think their entire
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
medical record went there um i think we
 
02:03:42.310 --> 02:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
just be very straightforward and say the
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
record of your vaccination
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
has been retained by the state and if
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
you don't want that you can opt out
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
because that's the only thing we're
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
talking about there's no other
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
information so if we say
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
your private health information
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
without clarification they would assume
 
02:03:58.550 --> 02:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
you mean their medical record i mean i
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
think it could be assumed and therefore
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
let's just say
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
record of your covert vaccination code
 
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
19 vaccination
 
02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:06.950 align:start position:0%
19 vaccination
uh

02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
was obtained by the state of new
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire during your vaccination
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
but if we're going to do that we also
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
have to put in the words that if you
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
delete this there is no other record of
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
your vaccination available for you
 
02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
the date
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh what it was
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
and the lot number in case of a recall
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
because people need to know the
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
implications of the withdrawal
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
so that's a lot of work we have to do to
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
make this right if we assume that this
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
is just the bare minimum that has to go
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
in we don't have to birdsmith all that
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
we can let the department do it and that
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
was i think what everybody has agreed
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
and it'd be nice even the word campaign
 
02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:46.790 align:start position:0%
and it'd be nice even the word campaign
personally

02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
personally
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
i don't get all bothered about because
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's not something that is
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
says that the banner has to say it's a
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
campaign we're just using a word
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
but i maybe i'm being sloppy but i just
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
i think we have to get this job done too
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
the question is how much do we trust our
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
friends at the table
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
to recognize our intent
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
trust is implicit absolutely and we
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
we're here trying to be helpful and only
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
because we just literally saw this less
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
than 10 or 15 minutes ago so we we
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
certainly honor and respect where the
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
committee is going we think this is a
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
great solution
 
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
and just would consider making sure that
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
your language mirrors what your
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
expectations are of the department
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your indulgence and um
 
02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:31.589 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your indulgence and um
and

02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair a very very minor
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
comment uh on page two the word campaign
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
on line one
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh it would have to be changed if you're
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
gonna do that then you'd have to be
 
02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:49.589 align:start position:0%
gonna do that then you'd have to be
consistent

02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
and have campaign changed on
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
i guess i need some guidance as to
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to continue
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing because i think that
 
02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.750 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing because i think that
um

02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
i would disagree respectfully
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
with representative knurk i think you
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
can simply keep the words
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
02:06:23.599 --> 02:06:25.589 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
attained

02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
attained
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
information about your vaccination
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
status your covet 19 vaccination status
 
02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
so we make it clear that that's what
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
without offering you a chance to opt out
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
of the registry
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
in fact the vaccine registry and then
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire constitution honors
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
your right to privacy including
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
your medical information and you have
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
the right to withdraw your information
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i do think that whether we specify
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
in the statute or not
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
there needs also to be a
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
a point about
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
if you choose to withdraw
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
your information from the registry
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
no further record
 
02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.709 --> 02:07:34.719 align:start position:0%
you used the passive voice rather than
 
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
the active voice
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
and mrs casey always yells in my ear
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
when the passive voice is used
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
but i don't know whether people want to
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
pursue that or not
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
the chair has a par
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
probably a procedural question prompted
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
by the honorable clerk for the
 
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.750 align:start position:0%
by the honorable clerk for the
parliamentarian

02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
and that is if we have
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced the cost
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
my opinion would be no but i would ask
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
you to run that by the house clerk and
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
the powers that made this an early bill
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
to begin with because
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
none of them actually listened to me
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
about these things
 
02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
but yes it would it would seem to me to
 
02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:28.790 align:start position:0%
but yes it would it would seem to me to
be

02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
easier but but that would have to be
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
approved by somebody else other than me
 
02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
my thought being i was asking not so
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
much for ruling but for your experience
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
in matters similar to this that we could
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
certainly get such a ruling over the
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
lunch hour and if it is not
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
in fact any more an early bill
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
this can be reamended and looked at at a
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
later date
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
question is being under the gun right
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
would it be um acceptable
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
that we recess this bill to get that
 
02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
information from the clerk and then take
 
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
this up in some form or another after
 
02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:09.830 align:start position:0%
this up in some form or another after
lunch

02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
and chairman pearson if the department
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
could be excused thank you on this bill
 
02:09:16.159 --> 02:09:16.830 align:start position:0%
could be excused thank you on this bill
we're

02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:18.550 align:start position:0%
we're
good

02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
we are putting this uh house bill 1608
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
executive session into recess to get
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
that information
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the bill's status now as an
 
02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
early bill and that will speak to
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
fn relative to expanding medicaid to
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
include certain include certain
 
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
postpartum health care services
 
02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
the chair rep
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative leon for a
 
02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:05.750 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative leon for a
motion

02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i move an
 
02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on house bill
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
and i apologize uh
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
can we withdraw what th that
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
if if the moving party and anybody who
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
seconded withdraw they can but
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
my question is if the motion is itl
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
we would not be voting on an amendment
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
how does one know that if there's an
 
02:10:51.119 --> 02:10:52.709 align:start position:0%
how does one know that if there's an
amendment

02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
that comes first
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's no problem with you just
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
discussing the fact of an amendment
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
adopting an amendment and then itlling a
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
bill is not the normal procedure you
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
could you could discuss the fact that
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment you could move the
 
02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment you could move the
amendment

02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
amendment
uh

02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:20.950 align:start position:0%
uh
but

02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
normally one doesn't
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
move an amendment and then
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
itl it that would be the reason if some
 
02:11:28.709 --> 02:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
if the majority accepts the amendment
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't they accept the bill as
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
amended is your point yes okay
 
02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:33.910 align:start position:0%
amended is your point yes okay
um

02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:34.790 align:start position:0%
um
then

02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:35.669 align:start position:0%
then
with

02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
you withdrawing this i
 
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment because it is an amendment
 
02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
from the prime sponsor
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you have that amendment you should
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
have that amendment before you
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
yes the the correct amendment
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
the revised amendment is
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
0572h and i have copies for everybody
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes i am happy to withdraw so i can see
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
so it's good to see what we have in
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
1536.

02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move that we adopt
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to hold on that until we're
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
gonna or we could just discuss the
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
amendment for that
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
sir having granted this i would like
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
can i can i speak to the amendment and
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
what it does
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
give us a few minutes to read it okay
 
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.840 --> 02:15:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation is added
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
and the date okay
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
got it
 
02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:06.790 align:start position:0%
got it
right

02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
no the only thing that's changed is the
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
date of the appropriation
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
okay can we come back now everybody
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to say that to everybody
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
the question is what's the difference
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
between the amendment and the original
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
bill representative shapiro it's your
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
amendment tell us
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
yes so the there are
 
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
there are two differences from that the
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
creates one is it changes the
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
date that a medicaid state
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
sent to cms
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that's on line 11
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
so it changes it to august 15th and in
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
it said
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
october 1st 2022. now it says
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
august 15
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
2022 so it moves it forward a little bit
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the second change the amendment
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
makes is that it adds an appropriation
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
of 200 000 for the fiscal year ending
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
given i assume
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh the democrat
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
caucus has discussed this i know the
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
republican caucus has given those two
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
changes to either party see the need for
 
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
we can ask some questions on this i
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
think before we move the amendment
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative leon um thank you mr
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and i have a question about
 
02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
just some of these technical aspects if
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
a woman
 
02:17:27.270 --> 02:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
let's say we pass this a woman
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
qualifies then is making more income
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
gets through this 12 months if she
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
becomes pregnant again before that time
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
period expires is she grandfathered into
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
another gestational period in 12 months
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
or would that new pregnancy require
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
separate qualification
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
even though she's already getting
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
expanded pregnancy and postpartum
 
02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:50.070 align:start position:0%
expanded pregnancy and postpartum
benefits

02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:52.309 --> 02:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
i think maybe somebody else is better
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
able to answer this than me but but what
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
we discussed when the bill had a hearing
 
02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
was the fact that
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
once somebody was on this 12-month
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
period of of
 
02:18:03.439 --> 02:18:05.429 align:start position:0%
period of of
postpartum

02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
postpartum
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid that even if their income
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
changed they would remain on it for
 
02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
those 12 months
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
so now you're asking if someone was to
 
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
get pregnant during those 12 months yes
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
yes i am um
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that but
 
02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
maybe i think there is someone here from
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
dhhs who's a medicaid specialist who
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
could answer that question
 
02:18:33.509 --> 02:18:33.519 align:start position:0%
they've all gone to lunch
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
i think dawn landry is here
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
can't see everybody out there
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
02:18:40.479 --> 02:18:44.070 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
sorry

02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
let's answer that question
 
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
hi good morning sorry about that i was
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
thinking you'd be a little more direct
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
i was trying to dig out the policy
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
guidance from cms that does answer that
 
02:19:00.399 --> 02:19:01.589 align:start position:0%
guidance from cms that does answer that
question

02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:03.190 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
so if she does become pregnant again and
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
she's in that 12-month period she does
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
get 12 more months
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
it starts to clock over
 
02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:14.870 align:start position:0%
it starts to clock over
okay

02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for that answer
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
i know that the
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
world health organization encourages a
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
24 month wait before pregnancies and i'm
 
02:19:25.349 --> 02:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
just worried about that incentive too to
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
stay on it wasn't my intention but hey
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
that was me
 
02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro well just uh to
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
the other side of that same coin is that
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
if someone
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
um remained on postpartum medicaid
 
02:19:41.519 --> 02:19:42.549 align:start position:0%
um remained on postpartum medicaid
um

02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
for 12 months rather than 60 days they'd
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
be more likely to be receiving care
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
during that time and they'd be more
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
likely to
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
receive birth control and family
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
planning information
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is more of a technical question for
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
the folks in
 
02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:05.590 align:start position:0%
the folks in
dhhs

02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
so if a
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
mother is pregnant and delivers the
 
02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:10.070 align:start position:0%
mother is pregnant and delivers the
child

02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
in a ghost of 12 months and on 13th
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
month she becomes pregnant doesn't she
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
start all over again anyways
 
02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:17.670 align:start position:0%
start all over again anyways
yes

02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
so therefore whether she's pregnant in
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
the 13th month of the 10th month really
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
is becoming irrelevant because of the
 
02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
fact that they're really independent
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
pregnancies one from the other
 
02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not advocating for it but that's
 
02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
kind of the reality of it yes and the
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
question from um in the cms guidance
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
does say the individual in this case
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
would receive continuous coverage
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
through the end of the 12th month
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
after the subsequent pregnancy ends
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with and then it cites the
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
so that's all right representative leon
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
i apologize i need to get better at this
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
being recognized thing
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
so that does mean that if a woman if we
 
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
extend it to 12 months she's taken a job
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
that does help l health insurance that
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
she's opting out of because she still
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
has medicaid if at month 11 she's
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
pregnant she then has the next pregnancy
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
and additional 12 months covered under
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
federal laws that we are bound to if we
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:12.550 align:start position:0%
do this
yes

02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:17.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
clerk

02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.399 --> 02:21:24.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
so there is
 
02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:28.070 align:start position:0%
so there is
a

02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
in month 10.
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
12 more
 
02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:40.630 align:start position:0%
12 more
months

02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
even though she may have gotten a job
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
that raises her above the income
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility and she has a job that has
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
insurance we're still going to pay her
 
02:21:53.429 --> 02:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
12 months of medicaid
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so we currently do that for the
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
60-day postpartum well
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
60 days is a lot different than
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
12 months
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
just to qualify is your answer to the
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative yes yes yes okay
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes i i understand why this is a um
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
concerning and
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
farthest from detail
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
i wish we could i wish we could we
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have to follow cms and we could
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
just do it our own way
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
i do believe we're getting off on a
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i would and i would say that yes
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
there are people that are going to go
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
back to their wall street job somewhere
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the middle of being on medicaid but
 
02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to be pretty rare
 
02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:56.150 align:start position:0%
that's going to be pretty rare
and

02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
there might be someone who
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
is lucky enough to buy an unsigned
 
02:23:03.429 --> 02:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
picasso at a yard sale and is going to
 
02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
be um
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
in good shape for the rest of their life
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
and get a few months more months of
 
02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:09.670 align:start position:0%
and get a few months more months of
medicaid

02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
but most of the people we're talking
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
about are not those people
 
02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:14.630 align:start position:0%
about are not those people
um

02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know i was reading in this morning's
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
paper one of yesterday's paper when i
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
was before i came
 
02:23:23.349 --> 02:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
and i was reading about
 
02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals at winchester school
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
and paraprofessionals at winchester
 
02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:30.630 align:start position:0%
and paraprofessionals at winchester
school

02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
are only allowed to work 34.6 hours
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
because of 35 hours they would the
 
02:23:37.990 --> 02:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
school district would have to give them
 
02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.590 align:start position:0%
school district would have to give them
um

02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:41.429 --> 02:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
health care health insurance and they're
 
02:23:41.439 --> 02:23:42.389 align:start position:0%
health care health insurance and they're
not

02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have the money to do it so
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
they don't do it so everyone works 34.6
 
02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:47.990 align:start position:0%
they don't do it so everyone works 34.6
hours

02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
now if you
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
i just did the math and if you
 
02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
worked as a paraprofessional with
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
some of our children or some of our
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
grandchildren in a public school and you
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
made 16 out an hour
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
you would still qualify for expanded
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid if you had if you had a couple
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
of children you're a single parent with
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of children
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
so i think we sometimes make assumptions
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
about people
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
who are on medicaid that aren't
 
02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:21.110 align:start position:0%
who are on medicaid that aren't
necessarily

02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say they're not necessarily
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
correct but they're not necessarily most
 
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
of people who are on medicaid and
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous amount of people on
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
who work hard
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
and still are
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
do not make enough money to to provide
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
health care to themselves and
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
these are the people
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill would make a tremendous
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
could you ask
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
during the hearing i heard because
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
conversation came up about somebody
 
02:25:05.270 --> 02:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
winning the megabox
 
02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:06.150 align:start position:0%
winning the megabox
and

02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
their obligation back to the department
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
with medicaid my understanding is that
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
if you have an income change
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
that makes you non-eligible that you
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
have to report that to the department of
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
human services so therefore this whole
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
issue becomes moot because once you get
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the point of being back on a higher
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
income that would disqualify them
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
at that point in time
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
by the virtue of notifying the
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
department of health human services
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
about their income status they would no
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
not under the protected status for the
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
12 month we we would not look at their
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
change in income for a 12 month period
 
02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about possibly again
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
legislating by exception so basically
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to get to is how many
 
02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:56.950 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to get to is how many
people

02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
or do we have any stats about how many
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
people actually fall into that bucket
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
because if it's one out of a thousand
 
02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:03.510 align:start position:0%
because if it's one out of a thousand
we're

02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
regulating because we're making laws
 
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question or a comment
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:14.950 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
chairman

02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i think we are
 
02:26:20.070 --> 02:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
identifying some issues here as far as
 
02:26:22.469 --> 02:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
the lack of affordability of
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
health insurance or health care
 
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
but i think our solution that we're
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
proposing here
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
is kind of going about it the wrong way
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
if we allowed more market competition in
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry and
 
02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:38.070 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry and
we

02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
encouraged alternative
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
forms of available health care
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
we could meet some of these needs
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
without having to put the cost on
 
02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:47.110 align:start position:0%
without having to put the cost on
taxpayers

02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
and certainly uh
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
a representative merchant raised a point
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
but i i believe that it's inaccurate
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that during that 12 months
 
02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
they don't have to report changes in
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
income right so
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
i just feel
 
02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:05.750 align:start position:0%
i just feel
that

02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
this isn't the way to go about fixing
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
this there are other ways that we can
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
address the issues
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
at hand and without burdening taxpayers
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
my question on this is is this a
 
02:27:26.469 --> 02:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
12-month or nothing
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
kind of bill can we adjust the 12-month
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
period to
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
six months of postpartum care
 
02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:36.469 align:start position:0%
six months of postpartum care
and

02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
be even an option
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro you know i i will
 
02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:47.190 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro you know i i will
um

02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
take a stab at this and maybe um
 
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
dhhs has more information but um this is
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
not something that was invented by the
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill this is something
 
02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:00.670 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill this is something
like

02:28:00.670 --> 02:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
1578 where there's a federal
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
option in law
 
02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
in this case it came with the american
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
rescue act
 
02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
and so this is a federal option that's
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
allowed that states are allowed to pick
 
02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:14.630 align:start position:0%
allowed that states are allowed to pick
up

02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
so my assumption
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
is that we can't necessarily shape it in
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
could we please hear from ms landry
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
whether she has an opinion as to whether
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
we could adopt a shorter time period or
 
02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:43.429 align:start position:0%
we could adopt a shorter time period or
not

02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
if she knows yes there's also a specific
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
question and answer from cms on that
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
issue and the question is do states have
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
the option to provide extended
 
02:28:55.590 --> 02:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage under the state plan
 
02:28:58.389 --> 02:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
for a period of less than 12 months
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
response from cms is no the state plan
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
option provides 12 months of postpartum
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
coverage states extending postpartum
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
coverage under the state plan do not
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility to establish a
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
different postpartum period
 
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that answers the
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
question very clearly
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
this may have been answered along the
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
way but let me
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
just nail it down for myself
 
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
is the federal monies that
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
we could tap into
 
02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
was this part of a specific bill with a
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
big part of money like we've seen or
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
does this look like this is now an
 
02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing budgetary thing from year to
 
02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:38.150 align:start position:0%
ongoing budgetary thing from year to
year

02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
i would have to defer whether it's other
 
02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:41.670 align:start position:0%
i would have to defer whether it's other
monies

02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
monies
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
to director lipman who is not here today
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
but this option right now under the
 
02:29:50.309 --> 02:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan is only available
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
for five years
 
02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:52.950 align:start position:0%
for five years
okay

02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
so it would end
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
sunset unless federal legislation
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
extends it it would currently sunset on
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
march 31st of 2027
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
and given the
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
way of things that once
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
something has been granted it's very
 
02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to ungrant it
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
it could well be that although at
 
02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:16.230 align:start position:0%
it could well be that although at
present

02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
some of the money to pay for this is
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
we may be facing in a few short years
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that we would be paying at all
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
given the way these things seem to work
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
if you snow some of the medicaid
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid services
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
federal funds also had not a 50-50 match
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
and a 90-10 match
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
um there is flexibility in the cms
 
02:30:54.309 --> 02:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
to claim the enhanced match so if there
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
was a woman who was pregnant
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
she was in the adult in the expansion
 
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
group and she became pregnant there is
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
claim that continue to claim that
 
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
enhanced match but there is some
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
guardrails in there that cms is putting
 
02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
up that we still need to have discussion
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
with cms on it might require um
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
also a state plan amendment to determine
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
the amount there the percentage of women
 
02:31:21.359 --> 02:31:23.510 align:start position:0%
the amount there the percentage of women
who

02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have transitioned into
 
02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:26.790 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have transitioned into
the

02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:27.510 align:start position:0%
the
group

02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
i snow know why why am i the only one
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
that has trouble with this i don't know
 
02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:46.710 align:start position:0%
that has trouble with this i don't know
anyway

02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
in addition to that question what i
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
wondered about was
 
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
if you expand it to 12 months the kind
 
02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
of problems that often occur that affect
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
the children in the mother sometimes
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't occur in the first 60 days after
 
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
delivery sometimes it's five or six
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
months later the postpartum depression
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
sets in the mother starts to ignore the
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
needs of her child and suddenly you've
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
got two damaged people
 
02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
a child that's being ignored and a
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
mother that is going to require some
 
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
sort of care
 
02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:16.070 align:start position:0%
sort of care
and

02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering i can see a lot of
 
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
advantages to doing this
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
and somebody else must have thought of
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
this when they took the move under that
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
rescue plan to expand it
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
isn't it just they want to give some
 
02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
money away i think they looked at some
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
of the advantages that would be held by
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
expanding it to 12 months and that both
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
the children and the women that are
 
02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
delivering children would be and keep in
 
02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
mind all we need is one child
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
ignored and ending up in a nicu right
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
after they come or later on having to be
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
placed in f
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take long to have enormous
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
costs in emergency room costs and other
 
02:32:53.359 --> 02:32:54.309 align:start position:0%
costs in emergency room costs and other
things

02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:32:54.319 --> 02:32:55.510 align:start position:0%
things
outweigh

02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
outweigh
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
the savings that you develop by taking
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
this proactive step
 
02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:01.110 align:start position:0%
this proactive step
sorry

02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative canarch
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
yes i would like to expand a little bit
 
02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
on that last comment
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
it is important to understand
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
that the costs don't go away
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
our entire health care system is
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
supported unfortunately with a system of
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
cost shifting
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
to cover uncompensated care to cover
 
02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.110 align:start position:0%
to cover uncompensated care to cover
well

02:33:23.110 --> 02:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
let's not go any further there's a lot
 
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
of cost shifting that goes on and the
 
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
bottom line again
 
02:33:30.309 --> 02:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
is the united states has the worst
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality rate of the developed
 
02:33:32.399 --> 02:33:33.750 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality rate of the developed
countries

02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
countries
 
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
and it's primarily because we do not
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
have good coverage remember over half of
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
our births are covered by medicaid in
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
this country
 
02:33:43.270 --> 02:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
so this is not a small number of people
 
02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:44.070 align:start position:0%
so this is not a small number of people
and

02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
as we look at it
 
02:33:47.429 --> 02:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
women have
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
just think of the physiologic changes
 
02:33:50.950 --> 02:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
that occur in your body when you're
 
02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:51.910 align:start position:0%
that occur in your body when you're
pregnant

02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
this is one of the biggest events in a
 
02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
human life
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
is to run through pregnancy
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
i haven't personally experienced it but
 
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
i've had a chance to observe it and also
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
take care of people with this and so it
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
is an enormous physiologic stress and we
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
know that there are a lot of problems
 
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
that can occur
 
02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy and particularly after
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and the heart association came
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
and did talk about the risk of stroke
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
and heart disease and so if someone
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
is not getting proper care
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
those risks go up which is one of the
 
02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
reasons we have the worst maternal
 
02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:24.550 align:start position:0%
reasons we have the worst maternal
mortality

02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
mortality
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
and these costs will not go away if a
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
person has a stroke
 
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
they don't suddenly at 60 days get all
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
better and require no care they may be
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
in a facility for the rest of their life
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
as and if they have their stroke on the
 
02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
61st day
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
so the costs that we see are not going
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
to just magically disappeared because we
 
02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't cover them or the taxpayer doesn't
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
cover them
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to be paying them for them
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
still through our taxes still through
 
02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
our premiums of our insurance
 
02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
because we as a society don't throw
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
people in the dumpster just because they
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance we take care of
 
02:34:59.359 --> 02:35:02.950 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance we take care of
them

02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:09.349 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:09.359 --> 02:35:10.710 align:start position:0%
so
just

02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
following up on representative canarch's
 
02:35:14.319 --> 02:35:16.469 align:start position:0%
following up on representative canarch's
comment

02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:35:18.469 --> 02:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
if a person has a stroke and finds
 
02:35:20.070 --> 02:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
himself disabled they're no longer
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
working and then they're eligible for
 
02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:22.790 align:start position:0%
working and then they're eligible for
medicaid

02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.750 align:start position:0%
medicaid
so

02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
if something were to happen that
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
disables a person
 
02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
after the 60 days of their pregnancy and
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
postnatal medicaid coverage ends
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
they would then
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
be eligible under a new condition may i
 
02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:39.110 align:start position:0%
be eligible under a new condition may i
respond

02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
respond
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative i agree completely
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
but that's why we need the care because
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
the hope is to prevent the stroke
 
02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
so the woman getting post postpartum
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
care you then notice gosh their blood
 
02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
pressure is staying up
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's a lot cheaper to give somebody an
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
antihypertensive than to treat their
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
stroke if they're not getting care
 
02:36:01.349 --> 02:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
you don't find it and we know that
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
chronic disease management of any sort
 
02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
pays back very well because it's far
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
cheaper for example just take asthma
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's far cheaper to have somebody
 
02:36:10.950 --> 02:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
getting their preventive care then take
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
care of them in the emergency room when
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
they can't breathe
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
may i suggest to the committee that
 
02:36:17.750 --> 02:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're now starting to hear the same
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
questions and answers again and again
 
02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
questions and answers again and again
and

02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:22.950 --> 02:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's good but there's a point at which
 
02:36:25.510 --> 02:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
we need to move on to something else i'd
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
like to call on two more people and
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
strongly suggest then we move along
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
in regards to the um
 
02:36:40.469 --> 02:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
cms is this sort of an all in or all out
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
can we cap it going back onto what
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative folsom was saying
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
is instead of limiting it from 12 months
 
02:36:49.270 --> 02:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
down to six months we heard that
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
through the guidance document
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
can you basically at that point in time
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
say that you want to cap it to so many
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i actually
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
have one more question for the expert
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
here as well
 
02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
it actually sounds like a lot of the
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
women who start off on medicaid in these
 
02:37:15.670 --> 02:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancies remain on medicaid because
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
they are in some of these different
 
02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:19.349 align:start position:0%
they are in some of these different
programs

02:37:19.349 --> 02:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
like being the the paraprofessionals or
 
02:37:24.389 --> 02:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
these other ones that that still keep
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
them within those thresholds do you have
 
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
any numbers about how many women
 
02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:29.830 align:start position:0%
any numbers about how many women
are

02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:30.950 align:start position:0%
are
[Music]

02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:37:33.429 --> 02:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
or earn themselves out of medicaid in
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
that 12-month period because it seems
 
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
like we're talking about these edge
 
02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
cases and um
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
i i know the people is it possible to
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
get that answer and then say a little
 
02:37:45.270 --> 02:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
bit more drama to finish right now i'll
 
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
finish right now
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
and my biggest thing is i understand
 
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
that people are smart people especially
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
people on medicaid they are trying to
 
02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:54.630 align:start position:0%
people on medicaid they are trying to
make

02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
stretch a penny into a into a quarter a
 
02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
dime into a dollar they are maximizing
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
every benefit and every opportunity that
 
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
we do and i'm just worried that this is
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
going to push women who are starting to
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
climb up the economic ladder into
 
02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
shortening the timing between
 
02:38:14.950 --> 02:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
pregnancies because it's a big economic
 
02:38:16.950 --> 02:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
hit to let this go so if you know the
 
02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
number of people who women who end up
 
02:38:21.429 --> 02:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
not qualifying for it
 
02:38:23.830 --> 02:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
based on income that would be a helpful
 
02:38:28.230 --> 02:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
i do not have that number with me today
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
but we that is something that we can get
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i should have asked
 
02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:35.910 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i should have asked
before

02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
may i float out the possibility that
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
reading the room which is not difficult
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
because we've been
 
02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of us have been talking on this
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
for some time now
 
02:38:49.030 --> 02:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
may i float out the up the idea that
 
02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps an interim study to work on
 
02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:57.439 --> 02:38:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
so up or down
 
02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:06.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
is this happening yes uh if i may that
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
during the multi-faceted issues that we
 
02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
were addressing right here uh there was
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
there is a need that's defined then and
 
02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
this is the first time this has come up
 
02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
before this committee but to do it right
 
02:39:22.469 --> 02:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
the first time i do believe a interim
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
study would make sense because we have
 
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
to have collaboration to achieve
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
consensus otherwise it's just not
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
happening and the debating point becomes
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
who's getting something for nothing
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
in my view
 
02:39:33.359 --> 02:39:34.309 align:start position:0%
in my view
and

02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
i am a believer that in
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
providing resources
 
02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:39.349 align:start position:0%
providing resources
to

02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure health
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore have a better result than
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
waiting for something greater to happen
 
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
and then dealing with that result i
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
found that to be a true negative um that
 
02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
and that i've learned right here in this
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
committee uh dealing with uh disability
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
issues and also help and then bona fide
 
02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
health issues that are quite broad with
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
all of us i do believe as a result i
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
would ask my colleagues to consider an
 
02:40:05.190 --> 02:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
interim study here with an aggressive
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
committee to be put together and to have
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
a a plan that's called has a cooperative
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration to achieve consensus on
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
if we may uh talking about that question
 
02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
of interim study rather than the bill
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
itself which i think we've well talked
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
through representative shapiro yes just
 
02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair so if if it was
 
02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:29.910 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair so if if it was
um

02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:33.269 --> 02:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
either unanimously or in a split way
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
went to interim study
 
02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:36.630 align:start position:0%
went to interim study
when

02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
when would be the earliest that could
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
come back
 
02:40:41.429 --> 02:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
i would ask that to representative weber
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
an interim study committee makes a
 
02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:48.950 align:start position:0%
an interim study committee makes a
recommendation

02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
generally around october or november
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
to the next legislature
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
they are allowed only to say recommended
 
02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
for future legislation are not
 
02:41:04.630 --> 02:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
02:41:07.030 --> 02:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're certainly allowed to specify
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
what they think is good for future
 
02:41:11.910 --> 02:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislation but any future legislation
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
has to be filed by a member of the next
 
02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
legislature and considered under the
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:25.349 --> 02:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
when a interim study is done
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
and they gather
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
more of the facts figures numbers data
 
02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
um because several questions have come
 
02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
out about that
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
can they present that
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
then to the or
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
make that available for the person
 
02:41:47.269 --> 02:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
offering the bill the next time around
 
02:41:48.950 --> 02:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's certainly
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
the right
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
of anybody who was on the interim study
 
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
committee to offer the information to
 
02:41:57.429 --> 02:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
anybody they want to offer it to but
 
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
there is no formal mechanism that i know
 
02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:02.070 align:start position:0%
there is no formal mechanism that i know
of

02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:03.110 align:start position:0%
of
that

02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
preserves that data and a record unless
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
somebody decides to do it themselves and
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:17.429 --> 02:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
looking for thoughts
 
02:42:17.439 --> 02:42:20.469 align:start position:0%
looking for thoughts
nods

02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
you know i must admit i'm torn on this
 
02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
there's a there's i really am and i
 
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative webber do you think we
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
if if you want a caucus that is your
 
02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
i would argue
 
02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:48.710 align:start position:0%
i would argue
that

02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:51.910 --> 02:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
the need is great
 
02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:52.830 align:start position:0%
the need is great
the

02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:42:58.870 --> 02:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:02.309 --> 02:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
the saving potential savings
 
02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
greatly outweigh
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:08.479 --> 02:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
i would argue
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we ought to just go ahead and pass
 
02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
the bill as with the amendment but
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
my call to make that's the call of all
 
02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
of us and
 
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
so it's up to you how to proceed
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes and
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
recess further consideration of this
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
bill until after lunch
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
so we will meet back here at one o'clock
 
02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:46.710 align:start position:0%
so we will meet back here at one o'clock
and

02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:48.389 --> 02:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
um after the room has been cleared if
 
02:43:50.150 --> 02:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
republicans could stay here for about
 
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:03.040 --> 03:33:58.150 align:start position:0%
 
of minutes

03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
so it was probably somewhere around 150
 
03:34:02.309 --> 03:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
to 200.
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
i probably this one said the average for
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:49.590 --> 03:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.110 --> 03:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:13.120 --> 03:35:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
financials

03:35:38.790 --> 03:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:48.550 --> 03:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:48.560 --> 03:37:19.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:30.790 --> 03:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:30.800 --> 03:37:50.790 align:start position:0%
 
how

03:37:50.790 --> 03:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:11.279 --> 03:38:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:38:38.790 --> 03:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
there is but i don't think we're voting
 
03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
no we had we had an amendment i think
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
they're just going to vote to send this
 
03:39:23.910 --> 03:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
into a study
 
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
is right thank you
 
03:40:05.040 --> 03:40:06.790 align:start position:0%
is right thank you
um

03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have been discussing this uh reopens
 
03:40:12.870 --> 03:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
the hearing on house bill 1536
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
and we have been in discussion
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i think we're pretty well discussing
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
everything we needed to discuss
 
03:40:25.030 --> 03:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
so the chair recognizes representative
 
03:40:27.830 --> 03:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
leon for a motion thank you mr chairman
 
03:40:30.630 --> 03:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
i move house i move interim study on
 
03:40:32.950 --> 03:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 1536
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
i have a second on that
 
03:40:37.510 --> 03:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
03:40:39.269 --> 03:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
discuss your purpose
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman
 
03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
when we look at this there's absolutely
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
unmet needs of women who are falling out
 
03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
of the current medicaid system
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
we do need to make sure that we're
 
03:40:52.710 --> 03:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
supporting them as they're returning to
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
work but we also need to make sure that
 
03:40:57.110 --> 03:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
whatever we're doing to follow the
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
federal government is the correct choice
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire that we're meeting
 
03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
these needs correctly
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
and that we aren't going to be
 
03:41:07.510 --> 03:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
incentivizing women who have used their
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
pregnancy as a springboard back into the
 
03:41:11.910 --> 03:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
workforce and to higher paying jobs that
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
disqualify them from serial pregnancies
 
03:41:16.950 --> 03:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
conceiving again before those 12 months
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
are up because
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
people follow the incentives and it
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
would be a pretty clear path in order to
 
03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
avoid a very large expense to your
 
03:41:25.040 --> 03:41:25.990 align:start position:0%
avoid a very large expense to your
family

03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
family
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
this is something that we need to make
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
sure that there's not a big moral hazard
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
here and
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
taking this to a true interim study
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
where we meet together and work on this
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
and try to figure out how to address who
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
these edge cases are
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
both on the ones that would be included
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
that perhaps shouldn't and those that
 
03:41:44.550 --> 03:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
that are falling through the cracks
 
03:41:46.710 --> 03:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
is the best way to address this and make
 
03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
sure that we're supporting our citizens
 
03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
and future citizens so we're moving i i
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
made the motion to interim study
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
03:41:58.550 --> 03:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
it was seconded by representative
 
03:41:58.560 --> 03:42:01.830 align:start position:0%
it was seconded by representative
cushman

03:42:01.830 --> 03:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:09.910 --> 03:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um while i
 
03:42:14.469 --> 03:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.479 --> 03:42:16.469 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:42:19.110 --> 03:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
am unable to agree with the underlying
 
03:42:19.120 --> 03:42:20.710 align:start position:0%
am unable to agree with the underlying
premises

03:42:20.710 --> 03:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
premises
 
03:42:22.229 --> 03:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
stated by
 
03:42:24.710 --> 03:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
the former speaker so
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh i will be
 
03:42:29.349 --> 03:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
voting against interim study because i
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
think that this is a bill whose time has
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
long since passed that we need it now
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
and that to delay
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
is pennywise and pound foolish
 
03:42:43.590 --> 03:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
that we will
 
03:42:46.150 --> 03:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
avoid significant costs which will be
 
03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
born either by the taxpayer or by other
 
03:42:51.030 --> 03:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
insured citizens
 
03:42:54.790 --> 03:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
and that this bill would avoid
 
03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
significant costs down the road so
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
i will be opposing the interim study but
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:03.990 --> 03:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
03:43:05.990 --> 03:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and i would agree i think i
 
03:43:07.590 --> 03:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
would agree with representing leon that
 
03:43:09.990 --> 03:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
do people do follow the incentives the
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
savings that a person might achieve by
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
being able to stay on medicaid and
 
03:43:16.469 --> 03:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
therefore not perhaps having to pay
 
03:43:19.189 --> 03:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
their insurance for a short time with
 
03:43:22.469 --> 03:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
their employer their contribution which
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
might be a small amount or might be a
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
very large amount
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
will be relatively small compared to the
 
03:43:29.189 --> 03:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
average cost of raising a child in this
 
03:43:31.269 --> 03:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
country to age 18 which is currently a
 
03:43:33.429 --> 03:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million dollars so if they
 
03:43:35.590 --> 03:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
do follow the incentives they will
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
probably not get pregnant to save
 
03:43:38.160 --> 03:43:39.349 align:start position:0%
probably not get pregnant to save
perhaps

03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
03:43:41.429 --> 03:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
five to ten thousand dollars at the cost
 
03:43:44.229 --> 03:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
of a quarter million dollars
 
03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
i was really torn
 
03:43:54.389 --> 03:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
realized that if there was a forced
 
03:43:59.429 --> 03:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
choice yes or no i would reluctantly
 
03:44:01.750 --> 03:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
vote no but no i would vote
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
and my sense is that would be not
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
because it's my vote but my sense is
 
03:44:09.510 --> 03:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
there'd be more no votes than yes
 
03:44:09.520 --> 03:44:10.870 align:start position:0%
there'd be more no votes than yes
and

03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:13.110 --> 03:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
i really wish that some work could be
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
done on this so i can vote yes in the
 
03:44:18.389 --> 03:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
future which is why i am voting interim
 
03:44:18.399 --> 03:44:19.349 align:start position:0%
future which is why i am voting interim
study

03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak representative
 
03:44:21.840 --> 03:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak representative

i'm glad to participate in interim study

i'm glad to participate in interim study
group

03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:35.590 --> 03:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know my my gut feeling is that
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
we're putting it off for a year whether
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
we itl it or interim study it and
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's not that much difference it's
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's a clearly delineated program
 
03:44:47.830 --> 03:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
because it's a federal option so there's
 
03:44:49.830 --> 03:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
not that much wiggle room in terms of
 
03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
what we do here in new hampshire it's an
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
option that we can take or not take
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i also would say that i personally
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
find it offensive that
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
people would talk about people because
 
03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
they don't have money that they would be
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
incentivized to get pregnant right away
 
03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
to keep medicaid i find that really
 
03:45:07.439 --> 03:45:09.910 align:start position:0%
to keep medicaid i find that really
offensive

03:45:09.910 --> 03:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
offensive
 
03:45:12.070 --> 03:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
i find it offensive sir that i can give
 
03:45:13.590 --> 03:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
you some names of people who have done
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%

and as you look at this amendment it
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
does carry the name of representative
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
edwards representative merchant did a
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
lot of work on this the reason his name
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
does not appear
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
is when ols needed to do work on this
 
03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
you got to get the
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
sign off by the chief person who was in
 
03:49:06.630 --> 03:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
committee at the time so we will give a
 
03:49:08.790 --> 03:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
big shout out to representative merchant
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
for his work on this amendment as well
 
03:49:14.150 --> 03:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
as representative edwards who i know
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
carried the day long and hard
 
03:49:19.830 --> 03:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
when this was in the possession of
 
03:49:24.389 --> 03:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
oversight committee um
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
how would you like gentlemen to
 
03:49:28.630 --> 03:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendments if i could mr
 
03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
chair um the chair of our subcommittee
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
was representative soloway yes and i
 
03:49:34.710 --> 03:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
would like to have representative
 
03:49:36.790 --> 03:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
soloway speak to the amendment
 
03:49:37.990 --> 03:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
and if he needs the assistance from
 
03:49:40.070 --> 03:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
myself or dennis i think that would be
 
03:49:44.309 --> 03:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:45.359 --> 03:49:46.469 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:49:46.469 --> 03:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'd like to give you an overview
 
03:49:52.070 --> 03:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
and then i'd like to turn it over to
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative merchant and if the chair
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
will permit to representative edwards
 
03:50:00.150 --> 03:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
though he does not sit on this committee
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
his role
 
03:50:04.150 --> 03:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
in crafting this amendment was so
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
significant that i would like to ask
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
permission for him to speak as well
 
03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
well first of all sir i think that's a
 
03:50:13.269 --> 03:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
splendid idea and secondly i will grant
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
it for no other reason
 
03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
than to atone for my oversight and not
 
03:50:20.309 --> 03:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
recognizing you first because you did
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
indeed chair this committee so yes
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
that does not mean mr chairman that i am
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
a bad person however there are other
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of things they imply however
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
that in a
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
cork board with a number of tacks i am
 
03:50:37.750 --> 03:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
not the sharpest of those
 
03:50:40.150 --> 03:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
it is a praise offering not a sin
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
offering to use the temple terms
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:50:46.469 --> 03:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
dear colleagues
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
um the initiative for
 
03:50:50.710 --> 03:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
came out of the uh
 
03:50:55.590 --> 03:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
committee on oversight of the department
 
03:50:57.510 --> 03:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
03:50:59.910 --> 03:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's actually a very significant bill
 
03:51:02.229 --> 03:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
and it speaks to some of the issues that
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
have been brought up earlier
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
in particular by representatives leon
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
gay and cushman in discussing uh 1608
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
and that is the issue of privacy
 
03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
for our constituents
 
03:51:20.080 --> 03:51:21.030 align:start position:0%
for our constituents
the

03:51:21.030 --> 03:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for dhhs
 
03:51:28.229 --> 03:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
thought long and hard about the data
 
03:51:31.030 --> 03:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
that our constituents provide
 
03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
and how to safeguard the privacy of that
 
03:51:37.189 --> 03:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
data in particular for those
 
03:51:39.750 --> 03:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
constituents who may or may not care to
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
have their data included in a state
 
03:51:42.319 --> 03:51:44.550 align:start position:0%
have their data included in a state
database

03:51:44.550 --> 03:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
database
 
03:51:47.189 --> 03:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
as a result of that
 
03:51:50.870 --> 03:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
we wind up with this bill before us
 
03:51:53.030 --> 03:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i must thank
 
03:51:55.510 --> 03:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
not only representative edwards who did
 
03:51:57.269 --> 03:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
yeoman's service on this
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative merchant representative
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
acton and representative kufal who uh
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
all of whom contributed significantly to
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
the thought that went into this
 
03:52:07.279 --> 03:52:08.710 align:start position:0%
the thought that went into this
so

03:52:08.710 --> 03:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:12.550 --> 03:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
there was a section of the original bill
 
03:52:15.750 --> 03:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
that spoke to the issue of opt-in or
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
opt-out of data
 
03:52:19.359 --> 03:52:20.389 align:start position:0%
opt-out of data
and

03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative edwards schooled us i
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
used the word advisedly
 
03:52:27.269 --> 03:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
in the differences between line and
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
staff functions
 
03:52:31.429 --> 03:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
and it comes it stems out of his
 
03:52:34.070 --> 03:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
significant military experience and what
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
he points out is
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
that you can put structures in place
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
and you can put operations in place the
 
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
important thing for us on this bill
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
was to put into place a structure
 
03:52:52.550 --> 03:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
for guaranteeing privacy
 
03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
the details of the process of doing that
 
03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
will be coming to us
 
03:53:01.750 --> 03:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
after crossover
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh on a in a bill
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
authored by senators rosenwald and guida
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
who sit on the
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
oversight committee of of of health and
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
human services
 
03:53:18.389 --> 03:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
i have conferred
 
03:53:20.550 --> 03:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
with senator guida and asked him
 
03:53:24.150 --> 03:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
pointedly is that bill going to pass and
 
03:53:26.550 --> 03:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
are we going to see it in our committee
 
03:53:28.870 --> 03:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
after crossover and he assures me that
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
that will happen so what i want to
 
03:53:32.870 --> 03:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
convey to you
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
is that our role here today
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
is to consider if we can put a structure
 
03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
in place in dhhs to guarantee privacy
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
with the confidence that we will then
 
03:53:49.349 --> 03:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
get the opportunity to discuss the
 
03:53:49.359 --> 03:53:50.550 align:start position:0%
get the opportunity to discuss the
process

03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
of guaranteeing privacy when we address
 
03:53:54.790 --> 03:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
the senate bill
 
03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
and that should satisfy
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
i think everybody's needs
 
03:54:02.630 --> 03:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to turn this over to
 
03:54:05.590 --> 03:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative merchant who
 
03:54:08.229 --> 03:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
really provided significant input into
 
03:54:10.710 --> 03:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
the sources of data
 
03:54:11.590 --> 03:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
to representative edwards and i'd like
 
03:54:17.349 --> 03:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
to indicate to you that we had we met
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
in deep conversation with mr gagnon who
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
is the privacy officer currently and
 
03:54:27.990 --> 03:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
with mr weeders who is the data man for
 
03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
dhhs so we've really processed in detail
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
so with that i will turn with deep
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
respect to my colleague representative
 
03:54:40.150 --> 03:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
merchant for his comments to be followed
 
03:54:45.990 --> 03:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you represent i also want to
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
recognize representative acton
 
03:54:53.189 --> 03:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative culpald yourself and also
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative edwards commissioner
 
03:54:57.590 --> 03:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
goulet along with mr weeders because
 
03:55:00.070 --> 03:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
they're very instrumental we spent a
 
03:55:01.590 --> 03:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of time going
 
03:55:02.950 --> 03:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
through this and with the guidance of
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
representative edwards doing the
 
03:55:06.389 --> 03:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing we're able to accomplish
 
03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we're proposing for
 
03:55:08.560 --> 03:55:09.510 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we're proposing for
you

03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
where the changes lie we get to some of
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
the detail
 
03:55:15.269 --> 03:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
if you go back to the original bill it
 
03:55:17.030 --> 03:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
listed if you will
 
03:55:18.870 --> 03:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
each position
 
03:55:21.670 --> 03:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
there wasn't any alternative
 
03:55:24.070 --> 03:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
for that so therefore what we did was we
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
still listed them but in the quorum if
 
03:55:28.469 --> 03:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
you go back and look at the quote
 
03:55:31.590 --> 03:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
number two line 26
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
members may delegate the authority to
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
represent who they are
 
03:55:37.990 --> 03:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
to maintain a quorum so we're not
 
03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
looking to have a designee on the top
 
03:55:42.389 --> 03:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
level but build that into the quorum at
 
03:55:44.790 --> 03:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
the bottom number two we also said that
 
03:55:46.870 --> 03:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has to be the chair of
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
this group
 
03:55:50.469 --> 03:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
and that was important because as the
 
03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner they should be the one
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
chairing this
 
03:55:55.830 --> 03:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
quorum in this meeting at the same time
 
03:55:57.670 --> 03:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
we allowed for the chair in the event
 
03:55:59.110 --> 03:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
that the commission could not attend
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
they could appoint somebody else on
 
03:56:02.790 --> 03:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
their behalf to be there
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.189 --> 03:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
we took out the section about the opt-in
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
and opt-out as representative soloway
 
03:56:14.070 --> 03:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
basically said this is a structure issue
 
03:56:16.229 --> 03:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
not a policy issue and to complete the
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
two is going to be problematic we have
 
03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity and we will have the
 
03:56:22.229 --> 03:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about the policy
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
issue when it comes across on the senate
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
side and we can deal with the policy
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
side when it gets to us at that time and
 
03:56:29.830 --> 03:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
not complete that with the structure
 
03:56:31.510 --> 03:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to the other thing we talked
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
about some certification if you go back
 
03:56:35.349 --> 03:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
into line three
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
sorry page three on line five
 
03:56:41.349 --> 03:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
certification and talking to people
 
03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
it was determined sometimes it's hard to
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
find people in the i.t world that have
 
03:56:47.349 --> 03:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
the appropriate certifications so
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
therefore we allowed for them to be
 
03:56:51.670 --> 03:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
hired but require them to be certified
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
within a certain period of time after
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
they're hired
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing was on line 11
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
we talked about the issue about the pay
 
03:56:59.439 --> 03:57:00.469 align:start position:0%
we talked about the issue about the pay
grade

03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
grade
 
03:57:02.229 --> 03:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
in talking to mr weeders and people in
 
03:57:05.189 --> 03:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
the i.t world a pay grade 27 was not
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
going to be sufficient to hire the
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
talent that we want so we have
 
03:57:11.590 --> 03:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
increased the pay grade paid grade 35 we
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
also put in appropriations of 254 000 to
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of that for the
 
03:57:18.229 --> 03:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
department so those are basically the
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
changes that we made within the bill
 
03:57:23.590 --> 03:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
they were in my opinion sort of minor
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
except probably again the policy one was
 
03:57:27.030 --> 03:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest one but like i said
 
03:57:28.950 --> 03:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
before that's coming across to us we
 
03:57:28.960 --> 03:57:29.670 align:start position:0%
before that's coming across to us we
will

03:57:29.670 --> 03:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
see it again and we'll have an
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to act on it
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't know whether
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative edwards or episode of
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
acton if you want to add anything to
 
03:57:42.150 --> 03:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
03:57:45.189 --> 03:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly new to the creation of the
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
structure of a governance board so
 
03:57:52.710 --> 03:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
but i do want to say that this was
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
it was an honor to take part in this
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
because it was a master class of taking
 
03:57:58.710 --> 03:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
disparate positions
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
and melding them together finding
 
03:58:02.550 --> 03:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
compromise and coming out with
 
03:58:05.349 --> 03:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
what is really a um
 
03:58:07.030 --> 03:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
a well-produced
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill here and um so
 
03:58:12.550 --> 03:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
part of that is is is representative
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
edwards's um insistence that we keep
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
this at a high level
 
03:58:18.469 --> 03:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
but also compromising to keep it at a
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
reality so that is realistic for the
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
people that are that are being tasked
 
03:58:23.990 --> 03:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
with being part of this
 
03:58:26.710 --> 03:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
um as well the the quorum
 
03:58:29.349 --> 03:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
the discussion of quorum was something
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
that i had had never
 
03:58:31.199 --> 03:58:32.790 align:start position:0%
that i had had never
um

03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
really thought much of but that's
 
03:58:36.550 --> 03:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
there's so much to it that i i didn't
 
03:58:39.030 --> 03:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
realize and and finally the the
 
03:58:43.030 --> 03:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
um allowing the the hire as an i.t guy
 
03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
allowing two years to get the
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
certifications need to get allows you to
 
03:58:49.030 --> 03:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
go find the right person and then let
 
03:58:52.150 --> 03:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
them get these specific it
 
03:58:52.160 --> 03:58:54.630 align:start position:0%
them get these specific it
security

03:58:54.630 --> 03:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
security
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
licenses and and certifications over the
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
two years i thought was a brilliant um
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
compromise to get to find the right
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
people to do this so um very impressive
 
03:59:05.040 --> 03:59:06.389 align:start position:0%
people to do this so um very impressive
and

03:59:06.389 --> 03:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:08.309 --> 03:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
something i learned a lot from
 
03:59:10.229 --> 03:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
03:59:13.990 --> 03:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to make certain you went
 
03:59:15.670 --> 03:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
through over the various things it does
 
03:59:17.349 --> 03:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
but i want to make sure i understand
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
with clarity i i think i do as i compare
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
the two what it no longer does
 
03:59:24.790 --> 03:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
it does it appear
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh take out
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
the language uh for the opt-in opt-out
 
03:59:31.590 --> 03:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
which was initially on the bill was on
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
page two lines 19 through
 
03:59:33.680 --> 03:59:34.870 align:start position:0%
page two lines 19 through
30

03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
30
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
and it appears to also take out the
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
language on page three lines 10 and 11
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
that required that uh
 
03:59:42.239 --> 03:59:43.349 align:start position:0%
that required that uh
that

03:59:43.349 --> 03:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:46.550 --> 03:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
you'd have to have this plan before the
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
before anything could happen but it did
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
have a nice
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
issue about on the amendment on page two
 
03:59:53.429 --> 03:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
line 30
 
03:59:56.150 --> 03:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
it points out it's still a good date uh
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
for when it is that
 
04:00:00.150 --> 04:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh things need to be in place to start
 
04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
collecting data so is it correct that it
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
is removed that opt out and update now
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the senate bills but this
 
04:00:08.550 --> 04:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
amendment does remove all that language
 
04:00:10.630 --> 04:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
privilege that it's a good catch yes it
 
04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
was an oversight my
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
part in not bringing it to everyone's
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
attention on page three on the original
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill we did remove lines 10 and 11
 
04:00:19.830 --> 04:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
because at that point in time for the
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
state and federal funds
 
04:00:22.710 --> 04:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to lock the department
 
04:00:25.830 --> 04:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
into a situation where
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to respond to it
 
04:00:44.309 --> 04:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:44.319 --> 04:00:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:00:50.229 --> 04:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
i uh i think i think the folks on your
 
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee have pretty much said
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
everything uh i i would like to uh
 
04:00:59.189 --> 04:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
respond to um a concern uh that about
 
04:01:01.269 --> 04:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
one thing that we did
 
04:01:03.910 --> 04:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
that has ruffled a little bit of feather
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
and and i hopefully not so much that
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
it'll entice
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
opposition but
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
um we had a discussion uh how much it
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
should be exposed to the public how much
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
it should
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh solicit public information
 
04:01:22.070 --> 04:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
by way of having a public member
 
04:01:24.229 --> 04:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i think what the working group
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
coalesced around was that
 
04:01:33.269 --> 04:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
since the privacy right was established
 
04:01:35.670 --> 04:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
we're still very early on in the
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
maturity model
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
for privacy within the department
 
04:01:42.960 --> 04:01:43.830 align:start position:0%
for privacy within the department
and

04:01:43.830 --> 04:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:47.269 --> 04:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
um and if you read some of the uh
 
04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
requirements that we're imposing on the
 
04:01:51.750 --> 04:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
board part of it is just to get educated
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot to learn about
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
privacy principles and there's a lot of
 
04:01:56.640 --> 04:01:57.830 align:start position:0%
privacy principles and there's a lot of
discussion

04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
about security techniques and the like
 
04:02:01.279 --> 04:02:02.070 align:start position:0%
about security techniques and the like
and

04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:03.990 --> 04:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
it was it was my belief and i think it
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
was shared fairly widely that having
 
04:02:09.189 --> 04:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
this be an internal
 
04:02:09.199 --> 04:02:10.389 align:start position:0%
this be an internal
looking

04:02:10.389 --> 04:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
looking
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
committee initially
 
04:02:15.990 --> 04:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
would allow them sort of the space
 
04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
to have serious conversations to admit
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
what they don't know
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
you know and and to get smarter and be
 
04:02:26.469 --> 04:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
put themselves in a position to where in
 
04:02:29.349 --> 04:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
four or five or six years
 
04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
that's about the amount of time it's
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
going to take for this governance board
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
to hit its stride in my view
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
so so i just assume let the
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
ugly growing pains of this kind of be
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors now now it isn't
 
04:02:49.030 --> 04:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
without some oversight specifically we
 
04:02:51.269 --> 04:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
have hhs oversight that you know is
 
04:02:53.670 --> 04:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
chaired by your chair
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
that can look into pretty much anything
 
04:02:57.990 --> 04:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so i would expect that the oversight
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
committee in the coming years would
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
check in on how this governance board is
 
04:03:05.750 --> 04:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
developing and can review some of the
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessments that are new
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
documents for the most part for the
 
04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
department and
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the extent that
 
04:03:13.920 --> 04:03:14.790 align:start position:0%
to the extent that
we

04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
learn things we can there's always
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
future legislation we're never really
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
done look at the medical cannabis for
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
example how much that's changed over and
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
over and over and changed over time so
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we need to do this just
 
04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
once this is landmark uh legislation
 
04:03:34.150 --> 04:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
let's get it in place
 
04:03:34.160 --> 04:03:35.110 align:start position:0%
let's get it in place
um

04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:38.469 --> 04:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
part of what we tried to do was to do
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
this in a way
 
04:03:42.389 --> 04:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
in which the department
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh could support it and i've been told
 
04:03:46.710 --> 04:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
mr weeders can
 
04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
you know throw things at me if i'm wrong
 
04:03:51.269 --> 04:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
but i think the department mr williams
 
04:03:51.279 --> 04:03:51.990 align:start position:0%
but i think the department mr williams
uh

04:03:51.990 --> 04:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
supports this
 
04:03:53.359 --> 04:03:54.630 align:start position:0%
supports this
amendment

04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
which is good because i don't want to
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
have to worry about the governor vetoing
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
it if we can get it through the
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
legislature so so and and i think the
 
04:04:05.349 --> 04:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
doit the commissioner of the department
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
of i.t
 
04:04:09.750 --> 04:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
likes this bill so much that
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
he's going to begin implementing some of
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
this at the state level and there was a
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
discussion that we had
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should just do this at
 
04:04:20.550 --> 04:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
services level or go ahead and take a
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
big bite and go for the state right away
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
and and so kind of out of an abundance
 
04:04:31.110 --> 04:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
of caution we just wanted to take one
 
04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
step at a time and there's nothing that
 
04:04:37.349 --> 04:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
prohibits the uh commissioner of i.t
 
04:04:40.950 --> 04:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
to uh leverage this work and leverage
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
the lessons learned uh and he said that
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
he's thought of as a result of these
 
04:04:49.830 --> 04:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
conversations for the last six seven
 
04:04:51.349 --> 04:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
eight months
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
is he wants to establish at the state
 
04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
level um a chief privacy officer
 
04:05:00.550 --> 04:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
um not more than half of the states have
 
04:05:03.030 --> 04:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
chief privacy officers all of them are
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
new within the last five to ten years so
 
04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's kind of
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
an emerging trend for government to
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
worry about privacy so so i think i
 
04:05:15.269 --> 04:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
think we're at a nice point um on that
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh wave so
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
if there are questions i'm happy to
 
04:05:22.630 --> 04:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
answer them questions from mr edwards
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:05:29.429 --> 04:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question
 
04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
i marked when we first when we first
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
studied this bill
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
that lines on page
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
two lines 19 through 30 were not are we
 
04:05:40.710 --> 04:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
on the amendment just so i'm tracking
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
the original because i don't have the
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
original one okay well it's not in the
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh the new amendment
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
it that dhhs did not like lines 19
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
through 30 which are notice consent and
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
data subjects
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:00.479 --> 04:06:02.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:06:03.990 --> 04:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
the first part says all personal
 
04:06:05.910 --> 04:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
information both manually and
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
electronically collected shall be
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
collected on an opt-in basis
 
04:06:13.830 --> 04:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
i can understand i can be talked into
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
accepting that that will take a while to
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
work in
 
04:06:19.750 --> 04:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
but after having worked in a company
 
04:06:19.760 --> 04:06:20.550 align:start position:0%
but after having worked in a company
that

04:06:20.550 --> 04:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
you know their business was
 
04:06:22.479 --> 04:06:23.590 align:start position:0%
you know their business was
uh

04:06:23.590 --> 04:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
writing software
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
i can tell you they
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
they don't like surprises later oh after
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
we've already built this now you want to
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
add this in and how do we you know if
 
04:06:34.710 --> 04:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
we'd known we could have made made it so
 
04:06:37.510 --> 04:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
there was a place to insert it so is
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
there any plan ever to uh put in opt-in
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you for the question
 
04:06:46.239 --> 04:06:47.189 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you for the question
um

04:06:47.189 --> 04:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:47.199 --> 04:06:48.389 align:start position:0%
um
there

04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
there's always an opportunity to add to
 
04:06:52.870 --> 04:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation as you know but i think
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
more specifically what we heard earlier
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
is that the senate has a bill coming
 
04:07:00.790 --> 04:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
over that has opt-in
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
built into its language specifically for
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
the closed loop referral system which is
 
04:07:10.150 --> 04:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
one of a multitude of i.t systems but
 
04:07:13.349 --> 04:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
that one got to be particularly uh a big
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
group of particular interests because
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
the closed-loop referral system is meant
 
04:07:18.080 --> 04:07:18.870 align:start position:0%
the closed-loop referral system is meant
to

04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
interconnect the uh
 
04:07:24.150 --> 04:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
the whole um system of care
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
of community-based care being
 
04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
coordinated and everyone getting the
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
wrap around holistic
 
04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
services that they need and because that
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
system would share personal information
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
theoretically all over the state
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
although practically that wouldn't
 
04:07:40.560 --> 04:07:41.750 align:start position:0%
although practically that wouldn't
happen

04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
but it did raise the concern
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
so so the closed loop referral
 
04:07:50.550 --> 04:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me the closed loop system
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
closed loop referral system there we go
 
04:07:54.630 --> 04:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
the closed loop referral system has its
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
own legislation coming
 
04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and and it's going to get debated and
 
04:08:02.149 --> 04:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
and the opt-in is part of that
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
and and and i just also want to just
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
04:08:05.359 --> 04:08:06.309 align:start position:0%
point out that
um

04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
there has been in my experience for four
 
04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
or five years whenever the discussion
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
opt-in opt-out has come up
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
um the department has pushed back
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
against it the legislature has been a
 
04:08:20.800 --> 04:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
against it the legislature has been a
little

04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
ambivalent about it in terms of it's not
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
been a fully bipartisan position
 
04:08:29.670 --> 04:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
so we haven't been clear
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
but i i think increasingly
 
04:08:32.239 --> 04:08:33.110 align:start position:0%
but i i think increasingly
the

04:08:33.110 --> 04:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:33.120 --> 04:08:33.830 align:start position:0%
the
the

04:08:33.830 --> 04:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
the department is hearing us
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the value of opt-in
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
and so i it's my hope that if if if this
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
really takes off like i wanted to this
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
governance board can institute their own
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:08:53.840 --> 04:08:54.630 align:start position:0%
so that
the

04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:57.510 --> 04:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
software won't be built based on this
 
04:09:00.790 --> 04:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
this this document is structured of
 
04:09:00.800 --> 04:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
this this document is structured of
people

04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
and systems
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
but the software my concern again is if
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
the software is built and then we say oh
 
04:09:11.110 --> 04:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
we really want to opt in on at least
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
certain certain aspects yes ma'am i can
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
clarify this a little bit maybe this
 
04:09:17.110 --> 04:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
will help
 
04:09:21.189 --> 04:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh when you look at the i.t portfolio
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
all of the it systems that dhhs is
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then you add to that all of the i.t
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
systems that the department of or the
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
department of i.t the state level
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
manages on behalf of dhhs you're talking
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
scores of systems
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
and almost all of them have their own
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
privacy issues so what this bill is
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
meant to do is say let's establish a
 
04:09:50.309 --> 04:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
governance board that that cares about
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
privacy and then let's
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
implement something called a privacy
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
impact assessment which is a particular
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
form of risk management
 
04:10:05.110 --> 04:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
methodology to where each it system gets
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
looked at and evaluated based on its
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
unique privacy issues and i.t security
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
issues and so
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
um so i think if we were to come back
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
and revisit this in five years the
 
04:10:19.750 --> 04:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
department would have gone from maybe
 
04:10:19.760 --> 04:10:20.550 align:start position:0%
department would have gone from maybe
one

04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessment to having
 
04:10:26.950 --> 04:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
a library of as many as 40 of them
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
so and each of those 40 would be
 
04:10:33.110 --> 04:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
related to a particular i.t system
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
now the best way to your point about
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know retroactivity
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get them with these
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessments to do them
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
before implementation
 
04:10:47.670 --> 04:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
of a new system or a replacement of a
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
new system so so by doing it in advance
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
of implementation
 
04:10:55.510 --> 04:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
they will have the opportunity to
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
consider opt-in as one aspect of a
 
04:11:01.269 --> 04:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
defense in-depth approach to protecting
 
04:11:01.279 --> 04:11:02.710 align:start position:0%
defense in-depth approach to protecting
privacy

04:11:02.710 --> 04:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative merchant did you want to
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:12.309 --> 04:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
no i'm all set i think representative
 
04:11:14.229 --> 04:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
edwards entered it answered it very
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
eloquently thank you thank you any other
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
any of the committee representatives
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
soloway merchant or edwards
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman are we due for a motion
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
um i was just thinking this would be an
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
excellent time and i was pondering in my
 
04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
mind who might wish to make a motion on
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
this very amendment i would like to make
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
that motion sir
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
as the titular head of the committee but
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
by no means the brains behind it
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
and i would like to move ought to pass
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
i can relate to the difference between
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
titular and brains behind served very
 
04:11:54.000 --> 04:11:56.389 align:start position:0%
titular and brains behind served very
well

04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment this is the
 
04:11:57.600 --> 04:11:59.189 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment this is the
amendment

04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
this is amendment
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
seven h now moved by representative
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
soloway and seconded by representative
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
acton do we need uh yeah we do actually
 
04:12:13.830 --> 04:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
any further discussion maybe not
 
04:12:13.840 --> 04:12:14.950 align:start position:0%
any further discussion maybe not
nope

04:12:14.950 --> 04:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
nope
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes yes hi
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
04:12:19.680 --> 04:12:20.950 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
chairman

04:12:20.950 --> 04:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:12:23.830 --> 04:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
i've got a list of grievances i'm sorry
 
04:12:23.840 --> 04:12:24.710 align:start position:0%
i've got a list of grievances i'm sorry
um

04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:27.990 --> 04:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't support removing the opt-in
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
opt-out provision especially if we're
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
trying to guide the department on which
 
04:12:37.190 --> 04:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
way to go with their new systems
 
04:12:37.200 --> 04:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
way to go with their new systems
[Music]

04:12:38.790 --> 04:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
if we're serious about privacy we should
 
04:12:43.830 --> 04:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
be making sure that every system used
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
within our government that collects
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
private information about
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh citizens is
 
04:12:49.920 --> 04:12:51.030 align:start position:0%
uh citizens is
truly

04:12:51.030 --> 04:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
truly
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
private and that there is an opportunity
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
to opt out of that
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
to opt in sorry
 
04:12:58.880 --> 04:13:00.469 align:start position:0%
to opt in sorry
um

04:13:00.469 --> 04:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
we need positive consent
 
04:13:03.600 --> 04:13:04.630 align:start position:0%
we need positive consent
uh

04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:06.309 --> 04:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have growing pains
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes
 
04:13:10.950 --> 04:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
i think it also provides
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:13:16.630 --> 04:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
or it it prevents
 
04:13:16.640 --> 04:13:18.469 align:start position:0%
or it it prevents
accountability

04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
to the people and i had speak spoken and
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
i appreciate
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative edwards's
 
04:13:25.439 --> 04:13:26.870 align:start position:0%
representative edwards's
viewpoint

04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
viewpoint
 
04:13:26.880 --> 04:13:28.229 align:start position:0%
viewpoint
on

04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:13:30.070 --> 04:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
allowing the growing pains to be behind
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
the scenes but i think from the birth of
 
04:13:32.319 --> 04:13:33.189 align:start position:0%
the scenes but i think from the birth of
this

04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
it should be open to the public these
 
04:13:38.790 --> 04:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
should be meetings where the public can
 
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
give input whether that's in a you know
 
04:13:44.070 --> 04:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
10 minute public comment period at the
 
04:13:46.389 --> 04:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
end or even just submitting written
 
04:13:46.399 --> 04:13:47.349 align:start position:0%
end or even just submitting written
comment

04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
um but i think that the minutes don't
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
cut it that they need to be able to see
 
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
the interaction the discussion how it
 
04:13:58.630 --> 04:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
all goes down how the decisions are made
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
and there's plenty of opportunity to go
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
into non-public for those sensitive
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
issues of security and
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
private information on people
 
04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
um if this is landmark legislation and
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
we are just
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
we want to give them a little bit of
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
time behind the scenes to have those
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
growing pains
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
then there should be
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
something in this amendment to make it
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
open to the public within six months or
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
a year or two years
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't see any of that and so for
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
all of those reasons i will not be
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%

04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
any other medical facility or provider
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
operated by the state of new hampshire
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
or any political subdivision they're
 
04:24:47.840 --> 04:24:50.309 align:start position:0%
or any political subdivision they're
under

04:24:50.309 --> 04:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.870 --> 04:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
this bill we came up with some issues
 
04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
regarding cms there were some concerns
 
04:24:58.710 --> 04:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
um i've been in touch with
 
04:25:01.590 --> 04:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
some officials across the country
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
who deal with cms including
 
04:25:04.319 --> 04:25:05.110 align:start position:0%
who deal with cms including
the

04:25:05.110 --> 04:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:25:05.120 --> 04:25:07.750 align:start position:0%
the
um

04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:11.429 --> 04:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
the national association of
 
04:25:11.439 --> 04:25:12.389 align:start position:0%
the national association of
um

04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
medicare or cms surveyors
 
04:25:17.910 --> 04:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the way this it that
 
04:25:20.469 --> 04:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
florida has passed a law that
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
contradicts the cms mandate and it
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
allows for additional exemptions that
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
are not required i mean not permitted
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
for the cms rules and arkansas has also
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
passed a similar law and so far there is
 
04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
no issue with cms and they are hopeful
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
that in the future cms is going to
 
04:25:40.149 --> 04:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
adjust the rule to articulate better
 
04:25:43.269 --> 04:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
with the varying state laws
 
04:25:44.469 --> 04:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
so this
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
allows instead of a blanket shall be
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
free from
 
04:25:51.910 --> 04:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
for those cms certified facilities it
 
04:25:55.110 --> 04:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
instead offers a streamlined exemption
 
04:25:55.120 --> 04:25:56.630 align:start position:0%
instead offers a streamlined exemption
process

04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:03.189 --> 04:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
in i'll just read it from the beginning
 
04:26:04.149 --> 04:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
so this
 
04:26:04.159 --> 04:26:05.349 align:start position:0%
so this
the

04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:08.950 --> 04:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh medical freedom from immunization act
 
04:26:08.960 --> 04:26:10.309 align:start position:0%
uh medical freedom from immunization act
shall

04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
shall
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
shall not and then it begins on
 
04:26:15.269 --> 04:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
line five apply to a county nursing home
 
04:26:16.870 --> 04:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state hospital or any
 
04:26:18.469 --> 04:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
other medical facility or provider
 
04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
operated by the state of new hampshire
 
04:26:22.149 --> 04:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
or any political subdivision
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
identified in paragraph one of that
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
statute which is subject to a valid
 
04:26:28.950 --> 04:26:28.960 align:start position:0%

04:26:31.110 --> 04:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
condition of participation that imposes
 
04:26:32.950 --> 04:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
a vaccination requirement
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
so that means there it still doesn't
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
apply to them however such facilities or
 
04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
providers shall upon an employees
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
contractors patients visitors or
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
students requests for a medical
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
religious or conscientious exemption
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
grant such exemption the written request
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
for exemption shall simply state i
 
04:26:55.110 --> 04:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
requester's name hereby submit a request
 
04:26:58.149 --> 04:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
for a medical religious or conscientious
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
exemption from the required vaccinations
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
and it shall be granted
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
there are 60 days for it to take effect
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
so they'll be able to figure out how
 
04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%

04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.469 --> 04:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
i'll raise the same question i raised
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
during the hearing to represent cushman
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
in the event
 
04:27:24.790 --> 04:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
that uncle sam decides not to send
 
04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
monies to the state of new hampshire
 
04:27:28.950 --> 04:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
because we violated
 
04:27:31.269 --> 04:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
i don't see a fiscal note here that
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
would say the state of new hampshire is
 
04:27:35.590 --> 04:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
going to cop up the money
 
04:27:37.510 --> 04:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
to back fill all the providers because
 
04:27:39.429 --> 04:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
if i'm a provider and i'm looking at
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
this i'm caught between a hard place a
 
04:27:43.349 --> 04:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
rock and i don't know which way to go
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
if i'm relying on the federal government
 
04:27:47.910 --> 04:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
to provide me with reimbursement for
 
04:27:47.920 --> 04:27:49.030 align:start position:0%
to provide me with reimbursement for
services

04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i don't have those dollars coming in
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
i then can't maintain my services to my
 
04:27:56.070 --> 04:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
constituents and to our residents here
 
04:27:58.229 --> 04:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire so would
 
04:27:58.239 --> 04:27:59.910 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire so would
the

04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:02.389 --> 04:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
folks be willing to write a
 
04:28:04.389 --> 04:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
bill that would basically say the state
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire will in fact
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
keep you whole
 
04:28:10.710 --> 04:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um it's not
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
necessary because right now cms is is
 
04:28:16.710 --> 04:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
going forward and reimbursing
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
facilities that are not surveying on
 
04:28:22.870 --> 04:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
this requirement of the cns cms mandate
 
04:28:24.469 --> 04:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
in the states that have laws that
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
contradict it they're still reimbursing
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
for services there they've been told by
 
04:28:31.510 --> 04:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
those states that the state will
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
continue to conduct their surveys as
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
they have and just not including that
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
piece of it as a part of the survey
 
04:28:42.149 --> 04:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
and and it's been going forward fine and
 
04:28:44.229 --> 04:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
they anticipate that
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
how do i say it not
 
04:28:50.720 --> 04:28:51.870 align:start position:0%
how do i say it not
in

04:28:51.870 --> 04:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:28:54.790 --> 04:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
instead of withholding funds they're
 
04:28:57.110 --> 04:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
more likely in the future to be
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
adjusting their their requirement to
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
allow for this different state
 
04:29:05.189 --> 04:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
laws so that they don't contradict
 
04:29:07.349 --> 04:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is thank you mr chairman and thank
 
04:29:11.110 --> 04:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
you for
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is the smallest
 
04:29:15.110 --> 04:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
of questions i'm just wondering why it
 
04:29:18.149 --> 04:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
includes students
 
04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes students are clinical
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
yep they do so medical provider students
 
04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:28.229 --> 04:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative connerk
 
04:29:28.239 --> 04:29:29.269 align:start position:0%
representative connerk
um

04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
the the problem i have with this is that
 
04:29:31.760 --> 04:29:32.790 align:start position:0%
the the problem i have with this is that
the

04:29:32.790 --> 04:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
rules from cms
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't say that they're going to
 
04:29:38.469 --> 04:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
immediately stop the funds they will
 
04:29:39.670 --> 04:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
first notify that you're not in
 
04:29:39.680 --> 04:29:40.950 align:start position:0%
first notify that you're not in
compliance

04:29:40.950 --> 04:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
they will try to work with them
 
04:29:45.110 --> 04:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
i think it might be a bit of a pipe
 
04:29:47.110 --> 04:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
dream to assume that their response will
 
04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
be to modify the requirements
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
rather than enforcing what they have
 
04:29:51.120 --> 04:29:51.990 align:start position:0%
rather than enforcing what they have
actually

04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
written as a mandate and the last step
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the mandate is to stop paying
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that is a very distinct
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
problem and i really don't think it
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
should be our
 
04:30:02.239 --> 04:30:03.269 align:start position:0%
should be our
choice

04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
to become the test case
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
for a uh
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
for this issue of whether or not they're
 
04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
going to withhold the funds unless we
 
04:30:13.030 --> 04:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
are prepared
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
to go ahead
 
04:30:17.110 --> 04:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
and backfill those funds we'd have to be
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
prepared to do that
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
secondly the other reason i markedly
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
disagree with this is because it does
 
04:30:25.110 --> 04:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
gut out everything else
 
04:30:29.110 --> 04:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
that is in 141 c1a ii
 
04:30:29.120 --> 04:30:30.229 align:start position:0%
that is in 141 c1a ii
um

04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
i think that is correct because it
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%

it

04:30:42.149 --> 04:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thank you
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
thanks for that clarification that makes
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
me feel far better okay but i still
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
would stand with my initial comment that
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think we would have to be prepared to
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
backfill because that is what they
 
04:30:54.800 --> 04:30:55.750 align:start position:0%
backfill because that is what they
cms

04:30:55.750 --> 04:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
cms
 
04:30:57.910 --> 04:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
plans to do there's no reason for us to
 
04:30:59.830 --> 04:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
think that they would not
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
well i have ample reason to think that
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
they would not because i've been
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
speaking with officials who work with
 
04:31:06.870 --> 04:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
cms across the country
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
and who have been dealing with this in
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
their state and cms has not made any
 
04:31:13.189 --> 04:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
indeed they've instead made more of an
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
indication that they're going to
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
adjust the rule in the future
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
to articulate well
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
with the varying state laws because they
 
04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there will be more
 
04:31:26.309 --> 04:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
states following florida and arkansas
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
you know it would not be look very good
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
on the federal government if they go
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
ahead and close hospitals for
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
control over exemptions
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative and line 12 of the
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
amendment when it says
 
04:31:44.159 --> 04:31:45.510 align:start position:0%
amendment when it says
required

04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:31:47.349 --> 04:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinations do you know what
 
04:31:47.359 --> 04:31:48.870 align:start position:0%
vaccinations do you know what
vaccinations

04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
are currently required
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
in for cms
 
04:31:57.189 --> 04:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
well in new hampshire nursing homes or
 
04:31:59.590 --> 04:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
yes the cova 19 vaccination is required
 
04:32:02.630 --> 04:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
for the cms that is the only vaccination
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
there is also influenza but the
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
what's that some how about polio or some
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
of the ones you need for school no no
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
none of those are required interesting
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to cut to the chase
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
whatever we think cms is or is not going
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
to do about the funding
 
04:32:32.309 --> 04:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
this applies to the
 
04:32:35.189 --> 04:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
places where we treat
 
04:32:35.199 --> 04:32:36.469 align:start position:0%
places where we treat
medically

04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
medically
 
04:32:36.479 --> 04:32:37.349 align:start position:0%
medically
or

04:32:37.349 --> 04:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:32:38.950 --> 04:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
in a mental health
 
04:32:38.960 --> 04:32:40.229 align:start position:0%
in a mental health
environment

04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
environment
 
04:32:43.110 --> 04:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable populations of our
 
04:32:43.120 --> 04:32:44.469 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable populations of our
state

04:32:44.469 --> 04:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:32:44.479 --> 04:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
state
and

04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
while there are many other places where
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate to allow
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
opting out of
 
04:32:54.960 --> 04:32:56.389 align:start position:0%
opting out of
vaccination

04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
this isn't one of them i think it's
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
perfectly dreadful health policy i think
 
04:33:03.030 --> 04:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly dreadful for our senior
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
citizens who are in nursing homes and
 
04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to it so i'm going to be
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
voting no on the amendment i'm going to
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
be voting no on the bill thank you
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
just to clarify the earlier point about
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
whether this applies to just covered 19
 
04:33:23.189 --> 04:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
vaccinations i i do believe that the
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
medical freedom from immunization bill
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
only applies to covert 19. so i think we
 
04:33:37.510 --> 04:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
are only talking about covert 19.
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's only covered 19. i think that's a
 
04:33:41.590 --> 04:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
good point yes
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.109 --> 04:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
i would also like to just
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
echo what representative weber is saying
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
which is that um
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of um
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
having funds held i just think that this
 
04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
is a policy that should be available to
 
04:34:01.279 --> 04:34:02.070 align:start position:0%
is a policy that should be available to
um

04:34:02.070 --> 04:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
medical institutions that are dealing
 
04:34:04.000 --> 04:34:04.869 align:start position:0%
medical institutions that are dealing
with

04:34:04.869 --> 04:34:04.879 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly vulnerable people and um
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
so i'll vote no on both the
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
amendment and the bill itself also
 
04:34:17.109 --> 04:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh just a couple
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%

04:34:33.279 --> 04:34:34.070 align:start position:0%
who i am they rely on me fairly heavily
for

04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
issues of epidemiology and infection
 
04:34:35.920 --> 04:34:37.510 align:start position:0%
issues of epidemiology and infection
control

04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
our county nursing homes in our
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state hospital have worked
 
04:34:46.949 --> 04:34:46.959 align:start position:0%
incredibly hard to keep covid under
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
control the most effective tool that
 
04:34:53.830 --> 04:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
they have had is immunization we don't
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
want to compromise that tool it's item
 
04:34:57.439 --> 04:34:58.629 align:start position:0%
want to compromise that tool it's item
one

04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.949 --> 04:35:04.959 align:start position:0%
i'm in touch with
 
04:35:08.070 --> 04:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
people nationally who are tracking the
 
04:35:10.789 --> 04:35:10.799 align:start position:0%
epidemic of covid
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
in particular i heard yesterday from
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
mike osterholm who is at the center for
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
infectious disease at university of
 
04:35:21.990 --> 04:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
minnesota i have some training at
 
04:35:23.910 --> 04:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
minnesota i know these people
 
04:35:23.920 --> 04:35:25.189 align:start position:0%
minnesota i know these people
and

04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
he says uh and and i absolutely trust
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
him that we have passed the peak of
 
04:35:31.600 --> 04:35:32.709 align:start position:0%
him that we have passed the peak of
covid

04:35:32.709 --> 04:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
covid
 
04:35:34.789 --> 04:35:34.799 align:start position:0%
we are watching the numbers drop they
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
are dropping precipitously
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the next threat is
 
04:35:41.910 --> 04:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
however this is probably an inopportune
 
04:35:45.520 --> 04:35:46.629 align:start position:0%
however this is probably an inopportune
time

04:35:46.629 --> 04:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
to be fiddling with
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
what has been
 
04:35:53.109 --> 04:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable success at dealing with the
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
outbreak this is just an inopportune
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
moment to fiddle with this again our
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
county homes don't want this new
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital doesn't want this
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
let's just leave it alone
 
04:36:06.310 --> 04:36:06.320 align:start position:0%

there's kind of two sets of deadlines at
 
04:36:54.310 --> 04:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
the moment there is the initial original
 
04:36:54.320 --> 04:36:55.590 align:start position:0%
the moment there is the initial original
deadlines

04:36:55.590 --> 04:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
04:36:57.029 --> 04:36:57.039 align:start position:0%
for any of the states that did not
 
04:36:59.189 --> 04:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
participate in any of the lawsuits at
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
the federal level against the mandate
 
04:37:04.230 --> 04:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
for the states that did participate
 
04:37:04.240 --> 04:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
for the states that did participate
our

04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
our final dead deadline is march 15th of
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
this year
 
04:37:10.400 --> 04:37:12.070 align:start position:0%
this year
so

04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
at the moment uh facilities in our
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
predicament are in the process of uh
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
becoming compliant with the mandates
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason they're actually
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
i would say certainly in new hampshire
 
04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
there's not been any enforcement of the
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate up to this point because
 
04:37:32.070 --> 04:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:32.080 --> 04:37:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:36.150 --> 04:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
guidance that we have received to date
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
does indicate that cms wishes to work
 
04:37:40.869 --> 04:37:40.879 align:start position:0%
with facilities as much as possible
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
to come into compliance and that's
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
that's pretty well articulated through
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
their guidance
 
04:37:48.070 --> 04:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
but they're
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
it does kind of end at a certain point
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
where they do start to talk about
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
termination of participation in cms
 
04:37:57.990 --> 04:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
programs accreditation things to that
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
effect and
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
essentially at that point you also start
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
to lose your funding as well so
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
they can withhold funding before you
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
lose accreditation if they so choose
 
04:38:08.709 --> 04:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
that is part of the accreditation
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
process for a lot of facilities um or
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
can be part of the accreditation process
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's very rare in occurrence but
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
um it sounds to me like there's mercy
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
but don't presume on it correct
 
04:38:21.279 --> 04:38:22.310 align:start position:0%
but don't presume on it correct
okay

04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:25.750 --> 04:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
i would also like to point out that i've
 
04:38:28.949 --> 04:38:28.959 align:start position:0%
pulled up the cms guidance and it has
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
guidance regarding requirements for
 
04:38:31.039 --> 04:38:32.629 align:start position:0%
guidance regarding requirements for
exemptions

04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
and their basis for medical exemptions
 
04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
and they list them they have to have a
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
process for medical exemptions
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
including documentation
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
which is signed by a licensed
 
04:38:42.320 --> 04:38:43.670 align:start position:0%
which is signed by a licensed
practitioner

04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
04:38:45.670 --> 04:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
for they have to have the basics of
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions that they must have
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
a process to request it and they have to
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
be documented
 
04:38:53.670 --> 04:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
and they do not have any exemption for
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
conscience objection
 
04:38:57.429 --> 04:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
so the difficulty is if we
 
04:39:00.390 --> 04:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
have if we do what's in this amendment
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
we will again be violating the guidance
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
from cms regarding conscience objection
 
04:39:07.830 --> 04:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
and also since this just simply says it
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
shall be granted it doesn't require any
 
04:39:12.629 --> 04:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
of the documentation that cms
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
requires therefore i would assume that
 
04:39:16.869 --> 04:39:16.879 align:start position:0%
we would if we chose to do what's in
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment we would be out of
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with this guidance
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that would put us at risk as they as
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
has been pointed out under enforcement
 
04:39:26.709 --> 04:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
they talk about what they will do they
 
04:39:28.551 --> 04:39:28.561 align:start position:0%
will cite the
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
facility they'll provide an opportunity
 
04:39:32.230 --> 04:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
to return to compliance then they use
 
04:39:33.750 --> 04:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement remedies such as civil
 
04:39:36.070 --> 04:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
monetary penalties denial of payment or
 
04:39:38.390 --> 04:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
termination this is from the cms
 
04:39:38.400 --> 04:39:39.830 align:start position:0%
termination this is from the cms
guidance

04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
i think again we're playing with fire to
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
pretend that just because florida hasn't
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
gotten in trouble yet and i think the
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
reaction which is not even being fully
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
enforced that that means we're clean we
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
are not
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that they would not have set
 
04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
this mandate if they didn't mean it and
 
04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
the supreme court again has
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
ruled that and they their wording was
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
quite clear that they support the
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
concept that since cms is paying the
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
bills they have the right to set the
 
04:40:06.070 --> 04:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
policies which they do for infection
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
control in any number of other settings
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
for their facilities
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not their facilities i'm sorry
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
places they pay
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i've taken the role of chair um i i
 
04:40:20.628 --> 04:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
will actually recognize myself here just
 
04:40:22.628 --> 04:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
to point out that the supreme court
 
04:40:24.628 --> 04:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
just stayed the injunction this is not a
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
final ruling so this is something that
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
is still in process so there's not yet a
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
final ruling may i respond to that
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
because it is that is true but if you
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
read the whole ruling they very strongly
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
supported the concept that cms cms has
 
04:40:39.670 --> 04:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
the authority to do it so if it works
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
its way back up to them i i there it
 
04:40:43.590 --> 04:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
would be unusual if they would not
 
04:40:45.030 --> 04:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
support it because their wedding was
 
04:40:46.708 --> 04:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
quite clear in their decision i read the
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
as far as that goes the questions may be
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
around exemptions so that's why we're
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
still discussing this i still have the
 
04:40:53.680 --> 04:40:54.470 align:start position:0%
still discussing this i still have the
chair

04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:40:56.310 --> 04:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative folsom please
 
04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative knurk i was
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
trying to listen really carefully as you
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
were reading that um
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
so i just want to clarify for myself
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
when with the exemptions they're asking
 
04:41:14.230 --> 04:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
for documentation
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
is that documentation from the person
 
04:41:19.110 --> 04:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
getting the accept exemption
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
or does the facility just have to have
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
documentation saying this is how many
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
religious this is how many
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
i answer that
 
04:41:28.320 --> 04:41:29.030 align:start position:0%
i answer that
yes

04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:41:30.788 --> 04:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
the guidance says
 
04:41:32.628 --> 04:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's basis for medical exemptions
 
04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
facilities must develop a process to
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
permit staff to request facilities must
 
04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
ensure all documentation is signed
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
and dated by a licensed provider so that
 
04:41:42.550 --> 04:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
means the documentation has to be signed
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
by a provider the documentation must
 
04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
contain all information saying why the
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
19 vaccine is clinically contraindicated
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
so for the medical it's not just they
 
04:41:53.190 --> 04:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
have to document how many medical they
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
have to the the documentation of why a
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
medical exemption is being granted must
 
04:42:00.390 --> 04:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
be clarified signed by a practitioner
 
04:42:02.708 --> 04:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
explain why it's a problem for example
 
04:42:04.708 --> 04:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
that they have an allergy to a component
 
04:42:07.190 --> 04:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
or something like that for religious it
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
also says they have to have a process to
 
04:42:11.110 --> 04:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
permit them and it says that they must
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
ensure that all requests for religious
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions are documented and evaluated
 
04:42:18.310 --> 04:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
evaluated in accordance with applicable
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
federal law and as part of the
 
04:42:22.628 --> 04:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
facilities policies and procedures
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that does not just mean that they're
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
giving the numbers it means that they
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
have actually when somebody applies they
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
have to document yeah i just wanted to
 
04:42:31.270 --> 04:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
clarify that because you read through it
 
04:42:33.510 --> 04:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
so fast i wasn't quite sure i was trying
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
to keep us moving
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:40.230 --> 04:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to raise another
 
04:42:43.670 --> 04:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
problem which again is let us back out
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
of the weeds of cms and look at the
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
if we adopt this which applies to our
 
04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
county medical facil our county nursing
 
04:43:00.628 --> 04:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
homes and the state hospitals
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
and i think the glen cliff home is
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.030 --> 04:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
what we are doing and and remembering
 
04:43:10.948 --> 04:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
number of people and it's a number
 
04:43:13.270 --> 04:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
greater than half in the united in the
 
04:43:13.280 --> 04:43:14.150 align:start position:0%
greater than half in the united in the
state

04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
who actually support
 
04:43:19.750 --> 04:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
mandates and support
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
the mandatory the the vaccination not
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
mandatory for the person but mandatory
 
04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
for people who choose to do the work in
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in the state hospital
 
04:43:32.788 --> 04:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here
 
04:43:32.798 --> 04:43:33.830 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here
is

04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:43:35.670 --> 04:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
we are creating
 
04:43:39.510 --> 04:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
a two-tier system of care so that if you
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
can afford private pay
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
for a nursing home or private pay
 
04:43:48.390 --> 04:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
for a mental institution that has a
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
policy that you agree with
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
you get to be cared for in a way that
 
04:43:57.670 --> 04:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:00.788 --> 04:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
and unexposed or less exposed because we
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
all understand that no
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
guarantees are made a hundred percent
 
04:44:06.080 --> 04:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
guarantees are made a hundred percent
but

04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
those among us who are the most
 
04:44:09.840 --> 04:44:11.350 align:start position:0%
those among us who are the most
vulnerable

04:44:11.350 --> 04:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the most sick
 
04:44:19.030 --> 04:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the most ill
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
are subject
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
to a regime in which
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
the minority is opposing their will upon
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
and the majority has absolutely no say
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
in it
 
04:44:34.470 --> 04:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's reprehensible i
 
04:44:36.788 --> 04:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
think we are sacrificing
 
04:44:39.430 --> 04:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
in preserving rights to some people we
 
04:44:42.150 --> 04:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
are sacrificing the rights of our most
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens to safety
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that's also a paramount right and i
 
04:44:50.070 --> 04:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
think that to adopt this would do them a
 
04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
great disservice and we'd be creating a
 
04:44:54.150 --> 04:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
two-tiered system of care which i also
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
think is reprehensible thank you
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
04:45:01.430 --> 04:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
as far as being able to mitigate
 
04:45:06.070 --> 04:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
infection we have ppe nothing in this
 
04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill prevents ppe from being used
 
04:45:09.990 --> 04:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
nothing prevents screening nothing
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
prevents testing
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
it's just that people have a
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
streamlined process of exemption we know
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
that under the civil rights act of 1964
 
04:45:22.470 --> 04:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
religious accommodations and
 
04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
accommodations for medical conditions
 
04:45:27.910 --> 04:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
are available to those who
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh request it
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
and that facilities can then require you
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
know increased screening or additional
 
04:45:39.190 --> 04:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
ppe or even assignment uh reassignment
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
of position if they
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
feel that it's necessary
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
and they can prove that um
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
that it uh that it is necessary so
 
04:45:55.510 --> 04:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee in any
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
because we have the civil rights act
 
04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have we acknowledge the rights
 
04:46:01.750 --> 04:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
of people to exercise their religious
 
04:46:03.750 --> 04:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs we acknowledge the rights of
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
people to be accommodated for medical
 
04:46:08.948 --> 04:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
issues that prevent them from receiving
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
a vaccination the problem is that it's
 
04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
becoming a religious inquisition and as
 
04:46:16.150 --> 04:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
the state we're setting the standard and
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
we need to say that this is not okay
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
and we also need to allow our
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional right of conscience which
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
the our state constitution says is
 
04:46:28.230 --> 04:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
unalienable it can't be given or taken
 
04:46:30.788 --> 04:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
away we need to provide for that and we
 
04:46:33.030 --> 04:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
need to set the example in the
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
state-owned medical facilities
 
04:46:39.670 --> 04:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
and as far as
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:45.270 --> 04:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're basically saying if we
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
if we
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass this
 
04:46:50.310 --> 04:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know that the state
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that if you don't buy a
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical product and you don't
 
04:46:57.190 --> 04:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
consume that and even though it's
 
04:46:57.200 --> 04:46:58.708 align:start position:0%
consume that and even though it's
irreversible

04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
irreversible
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
that you can't be a nurse and you can't
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
be an lna and you can't be a doctor
 
04:47:06.550 --> 04:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
and that you you know you're not worthy
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
of those positions and it's just not
 
04:47:08.798 --> 04:47:09.750 align:start position:0%
of those positions and it's just not
right

04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
and we need to come out as a state
 
04:47:14.788 --> 04:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
and set the example for the medical
 
04:47:19.270 --> 04:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take one and mr kuroso
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
right now are there a certain percentage
 
04:47:25.830 --> 04:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
of workers in our county nursing homes
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital and the clint
 
04:47:29.830 --> 04:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
glencliff home who are working even
 
04:47:32.550 --> 04:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
though they're unvaccinated
 
04:47:33.990 --> 04:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
um so i can speak to new hampshire
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
hospital on glencliff home i don't want
 
04:47:36.310 --> 04:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
to speak to the county nursing homes
 
04:47:37.910 --> 04:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
just because i i don't represent them
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't have insight into their
 
04:47:42.150 --> 04:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine statistics i'm at new hampshire
 
04:47:45.510 --> 04:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
hospital in glencliff home our staff are
 
04:47:45.520 --> 04:47:47.670 align:start position:0%
hospital in glencliff home our staff are
around

04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's easier to say who we know is
 
04:47:50.708 --> 04:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
vaccinated than not
 
04:47:52.550 --> 04:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
because those who we do not know are
 
04:47:52.560 --> 04:47:53.830 align:start position:0%
because those who we do not know are
vaccinated

04:47:53.830 --> 04:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
may have been and we just don't know yet
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
so both facilities are around 84
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated and fully vaccinated is
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
either two doses of one of the two dose
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
vaccinations or one dose of the the jnj
 
04:48:08.878 --> 04:48:09.830 align:start position:0%
vaccinations or one dose of the the jnj
um

04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:11.910 --> 04:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
and around 87 percent have received at
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
least one dose um so there is a portion
 
04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
of staff who are we are actively
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
engaging with to understand have they
 
04:48:21.190 --> 04:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
received a vaccination
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
before and uh we're just not aware of it
 
04:48:26.310 --> 04:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
or um are they pursuing an exemption or
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
something to that effect
 
04:48:30.868 --> 04:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
oh thank you and are we seeing any
 
04:48:32.708 --> 04:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
higher rate of transmission within the
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital and glencliff
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
home than we see in other areas
 
04:48:37.280 --> 04:48:38.948 align:start position:0%
home than we see in other areas
um

04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
i would say no um
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's a
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
easy comparison because there are so
 
04:48:46.708 --> 04:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
many factors that go into infection
 
04:48:48.868 --> 04:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
mitigation within a healthcare facility
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
um we've i would say
 
04:48:54.070 --> 04:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm proud to say we've actually i think
 
04:48:56.470 --> 04:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
done a pretty good job at managing covid
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
in both facilities we haven't had any
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
major adverse outcomes um and our um
 
04:49:04.550 --> 04:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're very proud of gwen cliff they went
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh i think over a year before they had
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
their first infection so
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
they did a phenomenal job in that regard
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:20.628 --> 04:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
as a hospital when i worked in the
 
04:49:23.680 --> 04:49:25.270 align:start position:0%
as a hospital when i worked in the
hospital

04:49:25.270 --> 04:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:49:27.030 --> 04:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
before i retired
 
04:49:31.110 --> 04:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
receive in order to continue employment
 
04:49:36.150 --> 04:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
can you explain or talk to us about
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
other vaccines that hospitals
 
04:49:40.470 --> 04:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
require their employees to actually have
 
04:49:42.150 --> 04:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things we had back at that
 
04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
point in time was
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine and you had a choice of
 
04:49:46.470 --> 04:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
getting the flu vaccine and wearing a
 
04:49:47.910 --> 04:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
mask and so forth you had to have an
 
04:49:49.990 --> 04:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
exemption for it can you speak to some
 
04:49:51.510 --> 04:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
of the other vaccines that are required
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
today by some of the hospital personnel
 
04:49:54.718 --> 04:49:56.230 align:start position:0%
today by some of the hospital personnel
sure

04:49:56.230 --> 04:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
in my a little over a decade of
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare experience at
 
04:50:02.070 --> 04:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
multiple employers some within new
 
04:50:03.750 --> 04:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire some outside of new hampshire
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
all of them have required some form of
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination there's kind of a standard
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
series of measles mumps etc
 
04:50:11.040 --> 04:50:12.948 align:start position:0%
series of measles mumps etc
and

04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:12.958 --> 04:50:13.990 align:start position:0%
and
those

04:50:13.990 --> 04:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
those are kind of a standard part of the
 
04:50:18.150 --> 04:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
orientation process i would say at
 
04:50:20.550 --> 04:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
virtually any healthcare facility such
 
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair um
 
04:50:36.868 --> 04:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
four things hit my mind one is
 
04:50:39.350 --> 04:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are the only
 
04:50:42.070 --> 04:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
method that we are told that in order to
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
work in a medical facility
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
that we're told that's the way to
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
protect them
 
04:50:49.990 --> 04:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
but we all know now that vaccinations do
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
not guarantee protection they are good
 
04:50:54.550 --> 04:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
for four to six months after you take
 
04:50:54.560 --> 04:50:55.830 align:start position:0%
for four to six months after you take
them

04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:50:58.830 --> 04:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
natural immunity is not recognized by
 
04:51:01.990 --> 04:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
cms and we know that that is long
 
04:51:02.000 --> 04:51:03.270 align:start position:0%
cms and we know that that is long
lasting

04:51:03.270 --> 04:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
lasting
 
04:51:06.150 --> 04:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
they've tested people from the 1918s
 
04:51:08.470 --> 04:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
while they were still alive in their 90s
 
04:51:12.070 --> 04:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
and found that they still had protection
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
effective medications are prohibited
 
04:51:17.590 --> 04:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
they are still prohibited
 
04:51:19.390 --> 04:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
even though they've been through like
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
160 clinical trials you still see
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
reports that say
 
04:51:26.830 --> 04:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
they need to be tested
 
04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
statistically they can be analyzed if
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
you will look at dr mobine syed's
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
website where he interviewed dr
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
the doctor who was here from virginia
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
dr merrick
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
they analyzed they went through
 
04:51:45.510 --> 04:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
study after study it was all very sound
 
04:51:45.520 --> 04:51:47.030 align:start position:0%
study after study it was all very sound
statistical

04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
statistical
 
04:51:47.040 --> 04:51:48.550 align:start position:0%
statistical
evaluations

04:51:48.550 --> 04:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
evaluations
 
04:51:50.948 --> 04:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
theirs has been in existence
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
for at least decades
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
and this
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine is different from all the
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
predecess predecessors
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
very different
 
04:52:01.920 --> 04:52:03.510 align:start position:0%
very different
more

04:52:03.510 --> 04:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine-injured people have been
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
reported to bears for this one than the
 
04:52:09.590 --> 04:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
sum of all the others ever
 
04:52:12.550 --> 04:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
so i think it's very short-sighted just
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
to follow cms rules because
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
they're not following the current
 
04:52:17.680 --> 04:52:19.830 align:start position:0%
they're not following the current
science

04:52:19.830 --> 04:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
science
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
and i do think safety is worthy
 
04:52:25.350 --> 04:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's not just what my freedom is is my
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
freedom going to impinge on somebody
 
04:52:28.948 --> 04:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
else's health
 
04:52:31.030 --> 04:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
but the point is we have a whole lot
 
04:52:31.040 --> 04:52:32.310 align:start position:0%
but the point is we have a whole lot
more

04:52:32.310 --> 04:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh tools to protect people that are not
 
04:52:38.230 --> 04:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
being used that are being ridiculed and
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's why it turned into a political
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
thing which it never should be medicine
 
04:52:44.070 --> 04:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
should never be political but it got
 
04:52:44.080 --> 04:52:45.510 align:start position:0%
should never be political but it got
politicized

04:52:45.510 --> 04:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
politicized
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
and uh people suffered as a result
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
because they were denied medication and
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
they still are
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why i
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
think that
 
04:52:56.550 --> 04:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
simply loosening
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
or not loosening but making getting uh
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
applying for exemption is a fair thing
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
we can still protect people vaccinations
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
are not the end-all and certainly not
 
04:53:09.120 --> 04:53:13.670 align:start position:0%
are not the end-all and certainly not
adequate

04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:16.868 --> 04:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
i have some pertinent uh
 
04:53:22.708 --> 04:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
i hate to take it back to cms but uh i
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
have some pertinent experience with this
 
04:53:24.400 --> 04:53:25.190 align:start position:0%
have some pertinent experience with this
uh

04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
i worked i was
 
04:53:30.628 --> 04:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
i.t director for a company that
 
04:53:32.830 --> 04:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
ran afoul of
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
cms based on
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
incorrect paperwork that was
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
submitted for reimbursements
 
04:53:40.080 --> 04:53:40.868 align:start position:0%
submitted for reimbursements
and

04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
what they do is they they don't tell you
 
04:53:44.310 --> 04:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's a problem all of a sudden out of
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
the blue
 
04:53:47.430 --> 04:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
they claw back the money
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that destroyed
 
04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
a 70 year old company in new hampshire
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
it caused 40 layoffs
 
04:53:57.990 --> 04:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
in in a matter of weeks we were taken
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
down and
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't even know it we didn't and we
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't appeal it you couldn't get
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
anyone answer the phone
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
so it is likely given the
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
given the
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
04:54:14.390 --> 04:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
ruling and the way they're heading into
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
this and some political
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
politicization that they will
 
04:54:20.150 --> 04:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
come after us
 
04:54:22.230 --> 04:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
um having said that
 
04:54:24.470 --> 04:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative gay makes some excellent
 
04:54:24.480 --> 04:54:26.150 align:start position:0%
representative gay makes some excellent
points

04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
points
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
and uh i got to tell you i'm leaning to
 
04:54:29.280 --> 04:54:30.628 align:start position:0%
and uh i got to tell you i'm leaning to
um

04:54:30.628 --> 04:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:31.750 --> 04:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know how i'm going to vote on
 
04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
this yet but i'm worried about seat i'm
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
worried about cms they are
 
04:54:39.030 --> 04:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh not um
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'll withhold my my opinion
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
but they it's likely they will act
 
04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you madam
 
04:54:52.560 --> 04:54:56.390 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you madam
chair

04:54:56.390 --> 04:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:58.390 --> 04:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
we're in uncharted waters and we've only
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
been in it for two years
 
04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
and a study says this and a study says
 
04:55:03.360 --> 04:55:04.628 align:start position:0%
and a study says this and a study says
that

04:55:04.628 --> 04:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's because people
 
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
are being bad i think because we are in
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
uncharted waters and not only that
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
things are changing too
 
04:55:14.590 --> 04:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
i have on a
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
microcosmic level
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
2 000 patients at our medical center
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
which is not huge but it's not nothing
 
04:55:27.270 --> 04:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
and so we get to watch unfolding before
 
04:55:27.280 --> 04:55:28.470 align:start position:0%
and so we get to watch unfolding before
us

04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
us

and maybe he knows something
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.350 --> 04:55:45.360 align:start position:0%

to take the risk
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
that going with natural immunity or

sufficient i'm not willing to gamble
 
04:56:25.590 --> 04:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are hiring out there
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to keep restrictions
 
04:56:30.150 --> 04:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
on you and the nursing home does not put
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
somebody out into the street jobless

introduced had both restrictions on
 
05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
government and restrictions on private
 
05:17:03.830 --> 05:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
and private industry
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment limits it just to
 
05:17:08.070 --> 05:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions on government so section
 
05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
one which is only prohibiting mass
 
05:17:10.638 --> 05:17:11.910 align:start position:0%
one which is only prohibiting mass
mandates

05:17:11.910 --> 05:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
05:17:11.920 --> 05:17:14.390 align:start position:0%
mandates
remains

05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
remains
 
05:17:17.190 --> 05:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll mention speak to that later
 
05:17:19.670 --> 05:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
once we move to the section two the new
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
subdivision if you look at these
 
05:17:25.590 --> 05:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
on the original one lines 16 through 20
 
05:17:27.190 --> 05:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
are struck those are the ones that are
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
about no person in this business doing
 
05:17:30.948 --> 05:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
business in the state shall require
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
patrons or customers
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
then when you move to line 23 of the
 
05:17:37.110 --> 05:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
it strikes person or so that this limits
 
05:17:42.868 --> 05:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
it to a governmental entity
 
05:17:44.550 --> 05:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
this is in regards to the unlawful
 
05:17:46.470 --> 05:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practice based on
 
05:17:48.628 --> 05:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
vaccination status
 
05:17:51.350 --> 05:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
line 27 of the original bill
 
05:17:53.830 --> 05:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
moves from an employer to a government
 
05:17:55.750 --> 05:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
employer so limiting this just to the
 
05:17:55.760 --> 05:17:57.990 align:start position:0%
employer so limiting this just to the
government

05:17:57.990 --> 05:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
then on page two lines one through three
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
are deleted because those are referring
 
05:18:08.948 --> 05:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
so when we look to this
 
05:18:13.350 --> 05:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
it is limiting it just to government
 
05:18:15.270 --> 05:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discuss about safety
 
05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
versus efficacy
 
05:18:16.878 --> 05:18:18.390 align:start position:0%
versus efficacy
and

05:18:18.390 --> 05:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
while we agreed to disagree on the
 
05:18:24.070 --> 05:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
efficacy over ivermektin and kovid
 
05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
the truth stands to bear that there are
 
05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
more data to support that than there are
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
to support the fact that a mass protects
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
anyone other than aware outside of a
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
health care facility in a health care
 
05:18:37.830 --> 05:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
facility they make they make a
 
05:18:37.840 --> 05:18:38.788 align:start position:0%
facility they make they make a
difference

05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:18:41.430 --> 05:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
and that is not something that comes
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
into play because
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
those are not the state or local
 
05:18:46.230 --> 05:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
government agencies those remain health
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
care facility decisions regarding mass
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
use ppe always should be in the hands of
 
05:18:52.868 --> 05:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
those facilities because that is how
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:55.920 --> 05:18:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:18:57.190 --> 05:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
this is narrowing it to the fact that we
 
05:19:02.550 --> 05:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
are government and we place restrictions
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
our job as legislators is to determine
 
05:19:07.350 --> 05:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
where the rights of government end and
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is placing limits we already have
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
state preemption on on other aspects of
 
05:19:16.390 --> 05:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
life and we tell that we tell our local
 
05:19:18.550 --> 05:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
government that there are certain things
 
05:19:20.070 --> 05:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they can't touch
 
05:19:28.948 --> 05:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:28.958 --> 05:19:30.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:30.718 --> 05:19:33.590 align:start position:0%
representative
weber

05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and while i appreciate the
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
limiting this to state government i
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
think there are still significant issues
 
05:19:43.830 --> 05:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
based on
 
05:19:47.430 --> 05:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
concerns of local areas what works for
 
05:19:49.910 --> 05:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
manchester does not work for cheshire or
 
05:19:51.750 --> 05:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
coast counties
 
05:19:54.470 --> 05:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
05:19:56.550 --> 05:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what the next thing is
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike
 
05:20:01.590 --> 05:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
i think basically that this is
 
05:20:04.550 --> 05:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
really bad health policy and
 
05:20:06.868 --> 05:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
i am going to vote no on the amendment
 
05:20:08.550 --> 05:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
although i do believe it makes the bill
 
05:20:10.230 --> 05:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
better i'm still going to vote no on the
 
05:20:11.750 --> 05:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and i'm going to vote no on
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill representative
 
05:20:13.920 --> 05:20:15.270 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill representative
soloway

05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
soloway
 
05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman ladies and
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
gentlemen i am pleased to inform you
 
05:20:21.990 --> 05:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill written specifically for
 
05:20:24.628 --> 05:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
kovit 19 has missed the departure of the
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
sailboat that vote has sailed and if you
 
05:20:32.548 --> 05:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
choose to rewrite legislation on general
 
05:20:34.470 --> 05:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
infectious disease
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
that might be useful but writing a bill
 
05:20:40.230 --> 05:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
specifically on coven 19
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
you missed it sorry
 
05:20:44.788 --> 05:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
is it your assertion that by the time
 
05:20:46.948 --> 05:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
this wins its way through the
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
legislative three weeks mr chairman
 
05:20:51.430 --> 05:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
three weeks the government
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that's yes to the question i'm trying
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
05:20:55.990 --> 05:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's over
 
05:20:57.910 --> 05:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
by the time we get to the floor the
 
05:20:59.750 --> 05:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
numbers are going to be so low and we're
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
going to say oh why did we bother
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
your red gown from bu doctoral program
 
05:21:05.520 --> 05:21:06.628 align:start position:0%
your red gown from bu doctoral program
sir

05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:21:08.548 --> 05:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
as you are sir
 
05:21:10.470 --> 05:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative kenner
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
fair enough i still have some concerns
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
for example the language in the mask
 
05:21:17.110 --> 05:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
mandate says to minimize the spread of
 
05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
covenant 19 or any other infectious
 
05:21:20.240 --> 05:21:21.350 align:start position:0%
covenant 19 or any other infectious
disease

05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
disease
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
we should not tie the hands of our
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
public health experts in terms of
 
05:21:25.440 --> 05:21:26.628 align:start position:0%
public health experts in terms of
responding

05:21:26.628 --> 05:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
responding
 
05:21:29.670 --> 05:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
to this or to the next upcoming
 
05:21:29.680 --> 05:21:30.788 align:start position:0%
to this or to the next upcoming
problem

05:21:30.788 --> 05:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:21:32.948 --> 05:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
if we have another
 
05:21:37.990 --> 05:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
infectious disease that is highly
 
05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
contagious and there is good efficacy of
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
mask wearing
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we lose one of the
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
options that the public health
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
experts have to use to mitigate
 
05:21:48.240 --> 05:21:49.110 align:start position:0%
experts have to use to mitigate
that

05:21:49.110 --> 05:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:51.270 --> 05:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
secondly strictly reading that
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
would say that we also our nursing homes
 
05:21:56.948 --> 05:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
which are run by the local government
 
05:21:58.708 --> 05:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
would not be able to put in a policy of
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
requiring their workers to wear a mask
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
or the visitors to wear a mask because
 
05:22:04.868 --> 05:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
this says
 
05:22:07.430 --> 05:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
any rule or regulation regarding it
 
05:22:10.390 --> 05:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
regarding coping 19 or any infectious
 
05:22:10.400 --> 05:22:11.750 align:start position:0%
regarding coping 19 or any infectious
disease

05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
disease
 
05:22:13.830 --> 05:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
another point that is troubling the
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
thing although you've made the language
 
05:22:17.430 --> 05:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
certainly far better in the lines in the
 
05:22:19.990 --> 05:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
amendment of i could say 15-22
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
when we say a governmental city cannot
 
05:22:23.040 --> 05:22:24.470 align:start position:0%
when we say a governmental city cannot
deny

05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
deny
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
employment we're back to the same
 
05:22:27.830 --> 05:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
problem we just talked about with the
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
cms mandate
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
our governmental entity of the county
 
05:22:31.760 --> 05:22:33.030 align:start position:0%
our governmental entity of the county
delegation

05:22:33.030 --> 05:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
and county
 
05:22:36.788 --> 05:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
commissioners run our county nursing
 
05:22:36.798 --> 05:22:38.070 align:start position:0%
commissioners run our county nursing
homes

05:22:38.070 --> 05:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
homes
 
05:22:40.470 --> 05:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
the government runs our new hampshire
 
05:22:40.480 --> 05:22:41.510 align:start position:0%
the government runs our new hampshire
hospital

05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
they would then not be able to do
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
anything regarding vaccination status
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
they would now again be out of
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
compliance just as we discussed on 1604
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a problem
 
05:22:55.830 --> 05:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
and uh let's see so this is
 
05:22:57.190 --> 05:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
that would have to do with all of the
 
05:23:01.110 --> 05:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
lines of 15 through 22
 
05:23:02.788 --> 05:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
i would think
 
05:23:02.798 --> 05:23:04.230 align:start position:0%
i would think
um

05:23:04.230 --> 05:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so i this this amendment still
 
05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
has problems it is better than the
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
05:23:11.830 --> 05:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
but it
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
has it's far too broad ties the hands of
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
public health
 
05:23:15.200 --> 05:23:16.548 align:start position:0%
public health
and

05:23:16.548 --> 05:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:16.558 --> 05:23:17.430 align:start position:0%
and
will

05:23:17.430 --> 05:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:23:20.708 --> 05:23:20.718 align:start position:0%
put us out of compliance again with cms
 
05:23:22.390 --> 05:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
05:23:22.400 --> 05:23:23.350 align:start position:0%
and i think
this

05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
again this one because it doesn't say
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
covet 19 specifically in the
 
05:23:30.070 --> 05:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
lines 15 through
 
05:23:32.548 --> 05:23:32.558 align:start position:0%
20 it talks about vaccination status
 
05:23:35.190 --> 05:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
that would also again also preclude
 
05:23:36.948 --> 05:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
vaccination for some for the next
 
05:23:39.030 --> 05:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
upcoming disease that we do not know
 
05:23:41.110 --> 05:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
what it is if covet has taught us
 
05:23:43.510 --> 05:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
anything it's to teach us that our
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
public health has to be nimble the
 
05:23:46.868 --> 05:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
countries that have been nimble in their
 
05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
response to dealing with it have done
 
05:23:51.030 --> 05:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
well those who have been sclerotic like
 
05:23:53.430 --> 05:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
we have been in terms of instituting
 
05:23:56.788 --> 05:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done have not done well
 
05:23:59.270 --> 05:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
is mr charisti still here
 
05:24:01.590 --> 05:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like you sir to address the uh it
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
was mentioned that this amendment would
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
put us out of compliance with cms and
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
since this is your a field of expertise
 
05:24:13.590 --> 05:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
with you could you address that please
 
05:24:15.270 --> 05:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
sure again for the record my name is joe
 
05:24:17.110 --> 05:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
christie cfo for new hampshire hospital
 
05:24:19.590 --> 05:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
glencliff home
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
so relative to the mask mandate portion
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill that is of concern for new
 
05:24:27.190 --> 05:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and glencliff home we
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
do require our staff to wear
 
05:24:30.868 --> 05:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
masks when in the building we also
 
05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
require visitors and so forth
 
05:24:35.430 --> 05:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
and we are considered state agencies so
 
05:24:37.750 --> 05:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
i do believe that it would apply to us
 
05:24:37.760 --> 05:24:39.590 align:start position:0%
i do believe that it would apply to us
um

05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:40.948 --> 05:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
05:24:43.830 --> 05:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh vaccine portion of this bill i was
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
just reading it i apologize i'm not as
 
05:24:48.830 --> 05:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
up to speed on this bill as i was on
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
1604 this amendment just came out today
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:58.150 --> 05:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
but if it were to apply to government
 
05:25:00.470 --> 05:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
entities then yes it would
 
05:25:02.390 --> 05:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
either government or healthcare or
 
05:25:04.390 --> 05:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
employers i guess whatever the the
 
05:25:06.070 --> 05:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
wording is in that bill
 
05:25:07.830 --> 05:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
that would pose the same problems that
 
05:25:07.840 --> 05:25:08.628 align:start position:0%
that would pose the same problems that
we

05:25:08.628 --> 05:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:25:10.150 --> 05:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
previously discussed
 
05:25:12.150 --> 05:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you sir you're welcome
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
05:25:17.190 --> 05:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
i live in keene and in keene we
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
currently have a mass mandate and we had
 
05:25:25.190 --> 05:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
one and then it expired
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
and then about a month ago
 
05:25:31.750 --> 05:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe a little bit longer um it was
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
put in place again
 
05:25:35.590 --> 05:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
and that involved
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
being brought up at the city council it
 
05:25:40.868 --> 05:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
involved many many people coming to
 
05:25:43.830 --> 05:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
testify people who were adamantly
 
05:25:46.868 --> 05:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
against mass mandates adamantly against
 
05:25:49.350 --> 05:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
masks and vaccines people who were for
 
05:25:49.360 --> 05:25:50.948 align:start position:0%
masks and vaccines people who were for
them

05:25:50.948 --> 05:25:50.958 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:57.350 --> 05:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
some of the counselors
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
who introduced this were very much for
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
it some were against it some were
 
05:26:03.990 --> 05:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
ambivalent and it was a long democratic
 
05:26:04.000 --> 05:26:05.030 align:start position:0%
ambivalent and it was a long democratic
process

05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:26:07.270 --> 05:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
and they did extremely democratic
 
05:26:09.910 --> 05:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
extremely rigorous process that led to
 
05:26:12.548 --> 05:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
our town having a mass mandate
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
and um i think that we should be able to
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
decide for our city
 
05:26:23.670 --> 05:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
and that i think um
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
the process not only left us with a mass
 
05:26:28.708 --> 05:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
mandate which i thought was useful but
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
it also promoted local democracy which
 
05:26:34.470 --> 05:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:26:36.788 --> 05:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of
 
05:26:39.990 --> 05:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
for the record before i forget
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:43.510 --> 05:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
what is the vote telly well i thank you
 
05:26:46.628 --> 05:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
for asking sir i was hoping you would
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
05:26:51.750 --> 05:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
not the amendment but the original bill
 
05:26:56.708 --> 05:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
579 in favor and 156 against
 
05:26:58.390 --> 05:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
one more thing i failed to point out if
 
05:27:03.110 --> 05:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
you look at line 23 that was the
 
05:27:05.430 --> 05:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
amendment on the amendment i'm sorry on
 
05:27:07.750 --> 05:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment line 23
 
05:27:09.990 --> 05:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
that will also remove our school
 
05:27:12.548 --> 05:27:12.558 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
because right now we have immunization
 
05:27:16.868 --> 05:27:16.878 align:start position:0%
requirements for children to
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
attend school for communicable diseases
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
this would remove that because we would
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
say that there can be no
 
05:27:25.350 --> 05:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination regarding the vaccination
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:32.788 --> 05:27:32.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know sir if this is anything in
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
your wheelhouse or not but you know if
 
05:27:36.868 --> 05:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
you feel like you wish to as an expert
 
05:27:39.030 --> 05:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
witness chime in i'd like to hear from
 
05:27:39.040 --> 05:27:41.190 align:start position:0%
witness chime in i'd like to hear from
you

05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:27:43.510 --> 05:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
05:27:46.230 --> 05:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry oh what we just said or
 
05:27:51.510 --> 05:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:55.830 --> 05:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
as i've stated before i think that the
 
05:28:01.190 --> 05:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
prohibit prohibiting masks
 
05:28:03.670 --> 05:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
relative to state agencies can impact
 
05:28:05.910 --> 05:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
infection control practices in our
 
05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities within the state
 
05:28:08.000 --> 05:28:09.030 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities within the state
so

05:28:09.030 --> 05:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:10.548 --> 05:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
and and i would also i guess add to my
 
05:28:11.990 --> 05:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that's not just new
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and glencliff home
 
05:28:15.350 --> 05:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
that could also apply to sununu youth
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
center the department of corrections
 
05:28:19.510 --> 05:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
virtually anywhere within our state
 
05:28:21.190 --> 05:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
government in which health care is
 
05:28:21.200 --> 05:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
government in which health care is
rendered

05:28:25.750 --> 05:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:30.310 --> 05:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:30.320 --> 05:28:31.270 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i have more testimony
 
05:28:35.430 --> 05:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
than what i've offered previously
 
05:28:38.070 --> 05:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's a real risk
 
05:28:39.510 --> 05:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's one that i'm personally concerned
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:45.030 --> 05:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
not just the financials but our
 
05:28:46.948 --> 05:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
accreditation and
 
05:28:49.350 --> 05:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
really our infection control practices
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%

05:29:36.558 --> 05:29:37.910 align:start position:0%
line 23 where
um

05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%

05:29:42.708 --> 05:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
anyway where we would talk about um
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
denying someone educational services
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
based on vaccine status that would be a
 
05:29:49.510 --> 05:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
very large concern to the apartment the
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
department related to keeping the very
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
important school requirements for
 
05:29:56.390 --> 05:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination in place for school
 
05:29:58.230 --> 05:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
attendance and we just wanted to point
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
that out that that would be a big
 
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
concern to us we were here testifying
 
05:30:03.670 --> 05:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday on hb 1035 a bill that you
 
05:30:05.670 --> 05:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday on that subject so the
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
chair wishes to state that
 
05:30:10.470 --> 05:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
in his intention because you see my name
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
at the top of the page
 
05:30:16.230 --> 05:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
lines 23 4 and 5 should not be there
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
and i may well have to vote against my
 
05:30:20.070 --> 05:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
own amendment
 
05:30:22.948 --> 05:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
because a public accommodation is now a
 
05:30:22.958 --> 05:30:25.030 align:start position:0%
because a public accommodation is now a
restriction

05:30:25.030 --> 05:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
05:30:25.040 --> 05:30:26.948 align:start position:0%
restriction
on

05:30:26.948 --> 05:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
some guy's pub
 
05:30:31.750 --> 05:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
and it says not just
 
05:30:34.390 --> 05:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccines in school but polio
 
05:30:36.150 --> 05:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines in school
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
so i do apologize these things do happen
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
but i was taught to clean up my own mess
 
05:30:42.948 --> 05:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
do not stand with this amendment as you
 
05:30:46.868 --> 05:30:46.878 align:start position:0%
have it before me because of those three
 
05:30:51.590 --> 05:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm thinking
 
05:30:58.230 --> 05:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
in light of the concerns
 
05:31:00.548 --> 05:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
with this amendment including the
 
05:31:00.558 --> 05:31:01.910 align:start position:0%
with this amendment including the
concern

05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
that it might prohibit health care
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
providers run by the state
 
05:31:10.390 --> 05:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
from taking exactly the same kinds of
 
05:31:13.510 --> 05:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
mitigation measures that we were told
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
would help
 
05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
if we allowed them to not require
 
05:31:21.190 --> 05:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines in the earlier bill
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
so we have the earlier bill which says
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be vaccinated
 
05:31:29.830 --> 05:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
and then you go into the county nursing
 
05:31:31.750 --> 05:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
home and say and i'm not wearing a
 
05:31:34.230 --> 05:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
stinking mask either
 
05:31:37.190 --> 05:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
because you have that right under this
 
05:31:38.390 --> 05:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
would that
 
05:31:40.628 --> 05:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
would that be of concern to you
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
that's a very large concern to us um
 
05:31:44.070 --> 05:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
certainly in the new hampshire hospital
 
05:31:45.510 --> 05:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the glen cliff home for those that
 
05:31:47.190 --> 05:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
cannot be vaccinated certainly for
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
medical reasons they would have to have
 
05:31:50.470 --> 05:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
that extra mitigation measure of being
 
05:31:52.230 --> 05:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
able to wear a mask
 
05:31:52.240 --> 05:31:52.948 align:start position:0%
able to wear a mask
and

05:31:52.948 --> 05:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes you may continue
 
05:31:58.390 --> 05:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
my follow-up comment is just a comment
 
05:32:00.230 --> 05:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
given the concerns about
 
05:32:05.910 --> 05:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
real functional internal issues here i
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
can't even begin to think what would
 
05:32:08.868 --> 05:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
happen with the department of
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
corrections for example
 
05:32:14.310 --> 05:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
would this perhaps be a bill that ought
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
to be referred for interim study and
 
05:32:19.030 --> 05:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
another of those committees that worked
 
05:32:21.670 --> 05:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
on it very carefully to balance the
 
05:32:23.750 --> 05:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
equities in a way that we are not going
 
05:32:25.830 --> 05:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to do in
 
05:32:33.430 --> 05:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:35.270 --> 05:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know who that was for but i'll
 
05:32:38.070 --> 05:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
say sure why not
 
05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%

issue there with not being able to
 
05:32:53.190 --> 05:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
mitigate infection in any way you can't
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%

05:35:17.110 --> 05:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
i've thought about that for a little
 
05:35:17.120 --> 05:35:17.990 align:start position:0%
i've thought about that for a little
while

05:35:17.990 --> 05:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
while
 
05:35:20.150 --> 05:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i think representative leon would be
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:34.958 --> 05:35:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
yep

05:35:40.470 --> 05:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
this concludes the um exec session on
 
05:35:45.430 --> 05:35:45.440 align:start position:0%

05:36:32.788 --> 05:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
537 i see one that's also 587
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
587 is the correct amendment this is the
 
05:36:37.430 --> 05:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
one that was shaped after our discussion
 
05:36:37.440 --> 05:36:39.110 align:start position:0%
one that was shaped after our discussion
earlier

05:36:39.110 --> 05:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
it changes
 
05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
the word
 
05:36:47.190 --> 05:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
campaign to outreach on page one line 29
 
05:36:47.200 --> 05:36:48.230 align:start position:0%
campaign to outreach on page one line 29
um

05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
wait a second let's get to get
 
05:36:50.638 --> 05:36:51.830 align:start position:0%
wait a second let's get to get
everything

05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:36:53.990 --> 05:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
going out here and find the original
 
05:36:54.000 --> 05:37:09.270 align:start position:0%
going out here and find the original
bill

05:37:09.270 --> 05:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so this um on page 1 line
 
05:37:15.910 --> 05:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
29 we changed campaign to outreach while
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
we sent in the language with line 1 on
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
page 2 saying outreach it still says
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
campaign but i think they can probably
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
follow the dots there
 
05:37:27.270 --> 05:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
then the language that the public will
 
05:37:27.280 --> 05:37:28.548 align:start position:0%
then the language that the public will
read

05:37:28.548 --> 05:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
read
 
05:37:31.110 --> 05:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
now reads as the state of new hampshire
 
05:37:33.670 --> 05:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
obtained information about your covid19
 
05:37:36.310 --> 05:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination status without offering you
 
05:37:38.310 --> 05:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
a chance to opt out of the state
 
05:37:40.868 --> 05:37:40.878 align:start position:0%
immunization registry our new hampshire
 
05:37:42.548 --> 05:37:42.558 align:start position:0%
constitution honors your right to
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
privacy including your medical
 
05:37:46.150 --> 05:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
information and you have the right to
 
05:37:47.830 --> 05:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
withdraw your information from the
 
05:37:49.750 --> 05:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
immunization registry
 
05:37:51.590 --> 05:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
if you withdraw from the registry the
 
05:37:54.230 --> 05:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
state will not retain a record of your
 
05:37:54.240 --> 05:37:55.750 align:start position:0%
state will not retain a record of your
vaccination

05:37:55.750 --> 05:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
05:37:57.910 --> 05:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
the department's still free to add if
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
they believe that that language is clear
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
and nobody else might have it but we're
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
trying to keep the language as limited
 
05:38:05.830 --> 05:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
as they might need just in case they
 
05:38:08.230 --> 05:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
roll off of a banner and it becomes
 
05:38:10.150 --> 05:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
another set of pixels thick and it
 
05:38:12.470 --> 05:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
starts obscuring the other information
 
05:38:14.788 --> 05:38:14.798 align:start position:0%
so they have the opportunity to say and
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
nobody else has it if necessary so this
 
05:38:19.670 --> 05:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
i believe comes from a conclusion of
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
what we did before and hopefully this is
 
05:38:26.070 --> 05:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
any questions representative weber
 
05:38:31.350 --> 05:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
i thank the representative for the
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and i think it clarifies
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
things significantly and i think that
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps whoever writes the blurb
 
05:38:38.400 --> 05:38:39.350 align:start position:0%
perhaps whoever writes the blurb
can

05:38:39.350 --> 05:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
it is our intent that if
 
05:38:46.390 --> 05:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
dhhs needs to add
 
05:38:48.708 --> 05:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
clarifiers they may but they are not
 
05:38:52.070 --> 05:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:55.110 --> 05:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
i would like the clerk to read
 
05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
the sign-in information
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay those that uh signed in in favor
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
was zero
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
those that signed in opposed is zero
 
05:39:14.868 --> 05:39:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that for a minute
 
05:39:18.390 --> 05:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
but that's what i got he really trusted
 
05:39:27.670 --> 05:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:29.670 --> 05:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and members of the committee
 
05:39:33.030 --> 05:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm about to lose friends on all sides
 
05:39:34.948 --> 05:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
um but when you've done that in the past
 
05:39:36.788 --> 05:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
we met up with you very quickly because
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
we like you
 
05:39:39.830 --> 05:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:39:39.840 --> 05:39:41.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

05:39:41.510 --> 05:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:44.470 --> 05:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
data is extremely important and
 
05:39:46.628 --> 05:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
extremely useful
 
05:39:49.670 --> 05:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
when it is accurate
 
05:39:53.830 --> 05:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
and then it can be used to make policy
 
05:39:58.788 --> 05:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
making policy on inaccurate data
 
05:40:03.510 --> 05:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
is not only foolish it's dangerous
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
in a recent unpublished study to which
 
05:40:09.910 --> 05:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
only i and three other people have
 
05:40:11.910 --> 05:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
access i'll explain it afterwards if
 
05:40:13.910 --> 05:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
anybody needs to know
 
05:40:16.708 --> 05:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
it was a study of data gathered in
 
05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
florida on vaccination status the data
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
was completely totally and utterly
 
05:40:27.110 --> 05:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
unreliable therefore worse than useless
 
05:40:27.120 --> 05:40:29.990 align:start position:0%
unreliable therefore worse than useless
dangerous

05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:31.430 --> 05:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
given that
 
05:40:31.440 --> 05:40:32.310 align:start position:0%
given that
i'm

05:40:32.310 --> 05:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
all in favor of the amendment i'm all in
 
05:40:37.350 --> 05:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill
 
05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%

the

05:40:41.190 --> 05:40:41.200 align:start position:0%

specifically
 
05:40:49.750 --> 05:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
our data is really inadequate
 
05:40:52.230 --> 05:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
if you have inadequate data you might as
 
05:40:54.390 --> 05:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
well not have any data and you might as
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
well give people the freedom to withdraw
 
05:40:59.190 --> 05:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
what data they have given thank you for
 
05:40:59.200 --> 05:41:09.670 align:start position:0%
what data they have given thank you for
listening

from house committee services
 
05:41:16.948 --> 05:41:16.958 align:start position:0%

yes representative acton thank you mr
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
chair um i just want to relay a
 
05:42:45.750 --> 05:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
finding i had with data collection
 
05:42:47.670 --> 05:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
earlier in my life
 
05:42:49.590 --> 05:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
after the earthquake in haiti i had the
 
05:42:51.510 --> 05:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
idea of going down i was working for a
 
05:42:53.830 --> 05:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
prosthetics company as an it manager
 
05:42:55.670 --> 05:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
um i had the idea after the earthquake
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
to go down try to get a head count of
 
05:42:59.350 --> 05:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
how many people had been
 
05:43:02.310 --> 05:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
received amputations we had seen in the
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
media of
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
ten thousand twenty thousand up to
 
05:43:07.270 --> 05:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
eighty thousand they may well have been
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
so but how many had actually survived so
 
05:43:11.190 --> 05:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
we went down and we thought it'd take us
 
05:43:13.350 --> 05:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
about a month to collect this data so we
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
started going field hospital field
 
05:43:17.110 --> 05:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
hospital throughout the disaster zones
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
about two weeks after the earthquake
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
by the second day
 
05:43:23.830 --> 05:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
where we had only collected maybe 10
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
percent of the data we were already
 
05:43:27.910 --> 05:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
making accurate predictions
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
on how many people had actually made uh
 
05:43:33.430 --> 05:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
received amputations so we we estimated
 
05:43:33.440 --> 05:43:34.868 align:start position:0%
received amputations so we we estimated
2100

05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
2100
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
after only collecting a small amount of
 
05:43:36.718 --> 05:43:38.548 align:start position:0%
after only collecting a small amount of
data

05:43:38.548 --> 05:43:38.558 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
after we finally got it all collected
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
the total number was about 2300 so we
 
05:43:45.350 --> 05:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
were actually very
 
05:43:47.430 --> 05:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
accurate and we only collected a small
 
05:43:49.670 --> 05:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
amount of data so i don't think you need
 
05:43:49.680 --> 05:43:50.708 align:start position:0%
amount of data so i don't think you need
100

05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
100
 
05:43:52.948 --> 05:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand this push to have
 
05:43:52.958 --> 05:43:54.230 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand this push to have
100

05:43:54.230 --> 05:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
100
 
05:43:57.670 --> 05:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
of all this data you can make
 
05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
you can make remarkably accurate
 
05:44:02.788 --> 05:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
predictions with smaller data sets
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to put that out there
 
05:44:07.430 --> 05:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
just mention for what it's worth we

with a 19 to zip

i really am i mean we do a lot of good
 
05:47:29.510 --> 05:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
work sometimes it doesn't happen

but we always hang in there together
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative kenner yeah just a quick
 
05:47:35.830 --> 05:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
question or favor i would say
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
because time will be of the essence of
 
05:47:39.670 --> 05:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
getting these committee reports to you
 
05:47:42.310 --> 05:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that there's no
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
missed committee reports
 
05:47:46.150 --> 05:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
if the clerk has kept a list could could
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
you just very quickly read off or if
 
05:47:49.590 --> 05:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's kept a list
 
05:47:51.350 --> 05:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
the bills we did today and who is
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
responsible so there would be no
 
05:47:54.868 --> 05:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
confusion where somebody
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't get it to you and then you have
 
05:47:57.830 --> 05:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
to chase him
 
05:48:00.150 --> 05:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
um i do appreciate that because i'd like
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
to get this on the calendar for our
 
05:48:03.750 --> 05:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
