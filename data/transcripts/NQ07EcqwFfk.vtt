00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the municipal and
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
County committee for hearing my
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460 align:start position:0%
um hb95 would enable municipalities to
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
enact regulations regarding rental
 
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.409 align:start position:0%
enact regulations regarding rental
practices

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:50.419 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
I will because we all know that we are
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
in a major major housing crisis though
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
some of us particularly say in my region
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast may be more intimately
 
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
familiar with the problem I'll speak a
 
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.620 align:start position:0%
little bit to that but I'll try not to
 
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:08.660 align:start position:0%
belabor the point
 
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:13.220 align:start position:0%
we are increasingly in a housing crisis
 
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
it's been going on for a long time but
 
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
has gotten much worse in recent years
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
and very frequent when we talk about
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
housing crises in general we think about
 
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
them I think at this level as Workforce
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
housing crises in in terms of well how
 
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
can people work in these towns if they
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to live in or even near
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
these downs
 
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
and that is certainly true and important
 
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
and it's also just housing like it's
 
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
literally about people having shelter
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
over their head so I want to kind of
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
hold both as we continue forward
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
um connected is the crisis that I've
 
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
heard so many times in my six years here
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
which is the graying of New Hampshire
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
the idea that we can neither keep nor
 
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:00.140 align:start position:0%
attract younger people to the state
 
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:03.260 align:start position:0%
in my six years I've heard a number of
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
propositions to try to ameliorate that
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
including things like building water
 
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
parks I want to quote an old political
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
quote when people said it's the it's the
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
economy stupid I want to say it's the
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
housing stupid it's the housing people
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
cannot come here not so representative
 
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.500 align:start position:0%

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%

00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
apologize representative Reed continue
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just as I was getting
 
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
on a roll no I'm just kidding
 
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
um the to restate what I just said the
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
point is is that we cannot attract or
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
keep young people here not because New
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire isn't desirable it most
 
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
certainly is attractive in almost every
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
conceivable way it is because they have
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
nowhere to live here they cannot buy a
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
home they can't even rent a place in a
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
lot of the places that they would be
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
able to work in so we are really talking
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
about two crises at the same time
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and there's a reason it's called a
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
crisis it's an emergency and certainly
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
in my area the Seacoast it is truly an
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
emergency people are getting pushed out
 
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
of their homes but not just their homes
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're getting pushed out of entire
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
towns entire regions and once you're
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
pushed out of a region you're pushed out
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
of your job for most people that I'm
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
talking about and in fact many people in
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
my area are being pushed out of this
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
State entirely
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
and a lot of what we've been seeing we
 
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:46.220 align:start position:0%
attribute to the market
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'll just give the example of what has
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
happened in my town over the last couple
 
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
years but coming to a head this past
 
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.220 align:start position:0%
summer one particular
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
person that comes from a developer
 
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:00.980 align:start position:0%
Financial family started buying up
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
multiple in fact I think the majority of
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
our multi-family housing properties
 
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.030 align:start position:0%
our multi-family housing properties
downtown

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
downtown
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
in many cases paying in our current
 
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
market as of this summer paying 50
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
percent more than the market rate which
 
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
apparently is the actual Trend and I'll
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
get to that in a second with the
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
explicit purpose of raising rents and
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
this particular person was Raising rents
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
two and a half times in some cases what
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
people were paying these people were our
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
local post office workers the people who
 
00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:35.339 align:start position:0%
worked in our local restaurants that
 
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:37.820 align:start position:0%
were very proud of in New Market
 
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:41.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of young professionals but also
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
veterans retired veterans one of whom
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
had lost his wife another battling stage
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
three cancer so all in all by my count
 
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
this particular landlord in his
 
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
practices pushed out over a hundred
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
residents of my town of Newmarket within
 
00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
most of were forced to leave the town
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
many were forced to leave the state
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
all for and I have no problem with
 
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
people owning properties and renting it
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
out it's the predatory aspect of going
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
into it knowing that you're going to
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
displace people I mean you have a choice
 
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
of how you make money if you have
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
investment funds you can you know build
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
a sweater Factory I don't know you can
 
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
do anything but to specifically go into
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
the business of displacing people out of
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
their homes for profit I I find to be
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
predatory and that's kind of where I
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
want to go with this
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
um so that was the story in New Market
 
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
but it's been happening everywhere in
 
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:42.500 align:start position:0%
fact there is one very public
 
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
proprietor I guess you'd call them I
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
kind of don't want to call them a
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
landlord because sometimes landlords
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
just own a couple of units but uh in in
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
Manchester who very publicly has posted
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
and coached and gloated on this exact
 
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
model then and saying very specifically
 
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
pay whatever you have to pay if it's a
 
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
hundred percent over market value pay
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
that there's essentially he said there's
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
no limit to what you can pay for a
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
property that would make it not
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
profitable you can raise the rent as
 
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
that person was out of Manchester by the
 
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.790 align:start position:0%
that person was out of Manchester by the
way

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
now my town my town of Newmarket was
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
trying their best to deal with this
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
crisis that we were having because of
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
several landlords but primarily the one
 
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
I've spoken about but as you know towns
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
have very very little that they can do I
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
don't have to tell you about Dylan's
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
Rule and and the fact that we have to
 
00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
enable towns to have any tools at their
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
disposal whatsoever
 
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.949 align:start position:0%
disposal whatsoever
um

00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
I just think that we do go out of our
 
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
way to protect property and protect
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
people with property we should also do
 
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
maybe as much to enable towns to protect
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
we need to remind ourselves that the
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
people that we're talking about are part
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
of our communities they are restaurant
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
workers bus drivers such as myself
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
and it frustrates me that when we
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
finally do get around to talking about
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
this problem it's often in the uh the
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
vein of their value as a worker and not
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
the basic right to have a roof over your
 
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
head because for them it's not a
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
cerebral issue about Jews does the
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
economy have enough workers it's about
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
am I going to be living in my car next
 
00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:27.110 align:start position:0%
am I going to be living in my car next
month

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
it's about what do I do with my cat if
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm living in my car do I have to move
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
my kids into a different School
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
these are real issues that affect people
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
on a very intimate and real way and I
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
kind of like I said want to keep that as
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
we go on so to get to the bones of the
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is enabling only as I
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
said I don't have to explain why that is
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
to you or the mechanism of that
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
and allows municipalities to set
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
different kinds of regulations on the
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
rental market I suspect there will be
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
detractors that will cry rent control
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
and all you know all that comes along
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
with that and it could a town could
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
potentially decide to have an actual
 
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
rent control but this is also rent
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
stabilization I think primarily rent
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
stabilization it provides a number of
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
tools at the town's disposal it's also
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
just notification of rent hikes can a
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
town say you know maybe for now while
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
the market is so very hot and while
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
people are suffering maybe we have a
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
six-month notice period
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
so there's a number of different kind of
 
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
scalpel level tools that this would give
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
the town to address the issue and I need
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
to Mark here that it doesn't apply to
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
like those small landlords I was talking
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
about earlier maybe somebody with an Adu
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
on their property this replies only to
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
restricted properties so I believe the
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
definition of that and we have experts
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
better than myself is anything over four
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
units but
 
00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:55.790 align:start position:0%
units but
um

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
just to make that clear
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
now towns unlike states are very agile
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
if we were to try to propose something
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
like this it would be probably two years
 
00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:07.459 align:start position:0%
before we could undo it
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
but towns can enact something and very
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
very quickly once they get that
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
Balancing Act of the market Forces
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
versus people being able to live they
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
can quickly
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
repeal it so giving them the tools to do
 
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.689 align:start position:0%
repeal it so giving them the tools to do
that

00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:22.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
allows them to have that agile emergency
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
response but most importantly for the
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
most part this is going to be funny that
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
I say this it's not going to happen
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
towns are not going to do this and when
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
they do they'll only do it long enough
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
to address an actual emergency in crisis
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
and the reason I know that is because
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
the incentive for towns is to have
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
higher property values that's how they
 
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
get their revenue
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
so since towns want higher property
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
values it is against the town's interest
 
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
to actually regulate rents and keep them
 
00:17:54.299 --> 00:17:55.130 align:start position:0%
to actually regulate rents and keep them
low

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.169 align:start position:0%
low
however

00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
Town governance and town people know
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
best what's in the best interest for
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
their towns and if this Balancing Act
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
has gone too far in One Direction where
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
people literally can't live and there
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
are no workers in that Community anymore
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
that can that can even live close to
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
that Community to work then that's an
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
emergency and that's a time where
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
the town should have the tools at their
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
disposal to try to reshift that
 
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
Balancing Act
 
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:28.210 align:start position:0%
Balancing Act
foreign

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:28.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
and like I said
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
um they are they are intimately familiar
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
with their towns they know best both the
 
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
housing market and the whether or not
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
people are able to afford homes and
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not people are working so if
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
for example people in my town and I
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
think that if this was enabled I still
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
would have a very uphill climb
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
convincing My Town counselors to adopt
 
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
something like this but let's say that
 
00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
our Our Town Council decided to adopt
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
something like this because they see the
 
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
emergency in that town who then are we
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
here in Concord to say Newmarket doesn't
 
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
know what's in new Market's best
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
interest even though Newmarket would
 
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
have the ability to quickly repeal that
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
who are we to tell them we from
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
disparate parts of the state that may
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
and you know there's the whole concept
 
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
of local governance being Laboratories
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
of democracy we talk about believing in
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
local control Laboratories of democracy
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
so because they're so agile they can
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
quickly undo anything that once it you
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
know balances the wrong direction so
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be educational for the
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
rest of us would that not then be aha
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is that is a regulation that goes
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
too far that will have this consequence
 
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
that information is extremely useful to
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
us for our own towns but also for
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
potential future State ideas of how to
 
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:57.740 align:start position:0%
deal with these crises
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
but in general
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
um I just want you to think of this as
 
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
like going to the ER with some severe
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
medical condition
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
when you have a severe medical condition
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
the doctor May give you things that are
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise you know risky or have side
 
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
effects like medicine or surgery or some
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
procedure that if you're healthy you
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
don't want and don't need
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
but you need it in an emergency and that
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
is what we are experiencing especially
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast
 
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.890 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast
um

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:30.539 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to wrap things up as quickly
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
as possible to give other people time to
 
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.230 align:start position:0%
as possible to give other people time to
speak

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
so I'll just I'll just close by saying
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
that I know that for a lot of us here up
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
in Concord this issue may be pretty
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
cerebral a lot of us have stable housing
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of us may have bought houses when
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
houses were five figures a lot of us may
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
own our homes outright so it may be more
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
of a intellectual exercise
 
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
but I do want to ask that you continue
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
to hold in your minds that this is a
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
very real issue that has very tangible
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
impacts on many many people especially
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
as not just knowing the national numbers
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
60 of our country is living paycheck to
 
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.430 align:start position:0%
60 of our country is living paycheck to
paycheck

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
paycheck
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
so this bill is enabling only
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh towns are in the best place to know
 
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interests of their
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
towns and have every reason not to enact
 
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
these things but need to have these
 
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
emergency tools at their disposal in
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
case they do and they're in the best
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
place to undo them when the time comes
 
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:33.059 align:start position:0%
to undo them
 
00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:33.710 align:start position:0%
to undo them
um

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
and with that I will take questions
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reed do we have
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:45.350 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.250 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
I see that you
 
00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
um chose to allow municipalities to do
 
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.950 align:start position:0%
um chose to allow municipalities to do
these

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.750 align:start position:0%
these
um

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
via bylaws and bylaws only require a
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing and and even if the
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
entire public came and said we don't
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
like this this is not for our town the
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
governing body would be able to pass
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
that by law anyways and
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
um there would be no way for those
 
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
voters to say this is not other than you
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
know going through the process of
 
00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:27.559 align:start position:0%
voting those people out there's no way
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
is there a question
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
so yes thank you would you believe um no
 
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.350 align:start position:0%
so yes thank you would you believe um no
um

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's a statement that that that is the
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
case so why did you choose
 
00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:41.330 align:start position:0%
case so why did you choose
um

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
um by law versus
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
um a vote of the actual uh legislative
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
body at the Town municipality level
 
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I do as a
 
00:22:54.649 --> 00:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
general principle I teach American
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
government at Community College so I'm a
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
very big I'm a very big small D
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
democracy kind of person that believes
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
in self-governance at the uh the lowest
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
level possible
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so in general and I have another bill
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
in that is enabling that I just spoke to
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday unrelated to you all that um
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
that I did do as a vote of the
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
townspeople but as I repeatedly said in
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
my testimony this is an emergency
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
situation and the town governance has
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
every reason to not want to pass these
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
things anyway because it will in
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
eventually inversely impact the market
 
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
and therefore their revenue so because
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
they already have the incentive to not
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
want to do any of these and because is
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
they are held accountable within the
 
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
following year for Municipal elections
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
in their own position and because this
 
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:43.340 align:start position:0%
is an emergency
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
I feel that having the town governance
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
be able to do it without necessarily
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
waiting until the next Municipal are
 
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for
 
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
representative Reed representative Brown
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
I actually have just two short questions
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand the emergency
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
nature of this so maybe you could
 
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
explain that to me and then I'll have a
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not I guess I'm at a loss for
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
anything in addition to what I've
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
already explained there are people I
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
mean I counted I literally counted the
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
people being displaced out of my town
 
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
and when I say displaced it's not as if
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
they just oh they go next door and rent
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
another one and isn't that fine because
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
of the nature of what's happening and
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
specifically predatory practices they're
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
being priced out of entire regions and
 
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
in some cases the state I'm on the
 
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
Seacoast so people are going to Maine
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
they're going as far as I know like back
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
home to other states like Florida so we
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
are losing good people good workers if
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
you want to think of them that way but
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
it's it's not just this nebulous like
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
economic thing yes it is an economic
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
thing and yes it is about losing I mean
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
we've heard so much about not having
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
enough Workforce anyway so you can think
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
of it in those terms but I'm literally
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
thinking about it in the terms of the
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
over 100 people who were pushed out of
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
my town some of which had to leave the
 
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
entire region and their jobs some of
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
which had to stay in a car for a Time
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
some of which had to move back home with
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
their parents that's an emergency
 
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.190 align:start position:0%
their parents that's an emergency
so

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up representative
 
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.110 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up representative
Brown

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
Brown
 
00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:27.059 align:start position:0%
go ahead in in regard to uh the answer
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
you gave regarding the bylaws versus the
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
legislative body can you just clarify
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more for me why that
 
00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:39.419 align:start position:0%
process is important to just have a the
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
bylaws versus allowing the legislative
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
body to vote on I know you mentioned
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
that about elections coming up but can
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
you clarify it again why why you think
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's important so I don't know if you
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
mean when you say legislative body if
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
you mean the electorate so the question
 
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.570 align:start position:0%
you mean the electorate so the question
is

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
um who do you want making these
 
00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:00.299 align:start position:0%
decisions and like we do with all levels
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
of government government you know some
 
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
things for example we allow
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
Administration to do because it's to
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
find detail and they need the agility to
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
act and enact different rules and
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
regulations things that don't need to be
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
put legislatively into statute but they
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
need to be able to do that it's a kind
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
of a similar thing in fact all
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
government is representational so when
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
we elect a town select board for example
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
example or in my case the Town Council
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
we are electing people to make those
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
kind of short quick decisions for us and
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
then we have the yearly not only
 
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
elections for those officers but also
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
elections for anything else we want to
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
put on the warrant so the reason I said
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
I opted to allow the governing body of
 
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
the town to make these decisions is
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
because they are more agile rather than
 
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
waiting in an emergency rather than
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
waiting a full year up to a full year to
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
put something on the warrant which I
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
don't know that we would even be able to
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
do that right now at this point you
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
still need to enable you still need to
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
enable the towns but they have the more
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
ability to both enact and repeal than
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
waiting for a yearly election and as
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
always our representatives are held
 
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
accountable and it's kind of fortunate
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
we have yearly elections for municipal
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.230 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question do
 
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.970 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question do
you

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
um do you anticipate with the language
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
here that the governing body is free to
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
choose any source to
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh establish what the increase can be or
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
do you assume that there will be a
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
single source that the legislative body
 
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
would have to go to to say based on
 
00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
X based on U.S Census Bureau based on
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
the BLS etc etc or do you do you
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
anticipate that they had the freedom uh
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
in my bill they have the freedom we do
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
not micromanage them and that is because
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
these Market forces are fast acting and
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
how could we possibly predict you know
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
for example the the housing market in
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
two months in Portsmouth for example but
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth City councilors have that
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
information and are better able to
 
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
respond so in terms of what would they
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
draw on we're not limiting any
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
information however in statute we do
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
have a Workforce housing formula that
 
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
they could easily go to and plug in
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
numbers and use that I'm not mandating
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
that but um but yeah that's that's
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
hi representative Reed um so just for
 
00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
disclosure purposes I'm a co-sponsor on
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation and uh due to the new
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
rural um about either testifying or
 
00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:06.539 align:start position:0%
asking questions uh I am taking the
 
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:07.940 align:start position:0%
asking questions
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
uh choice of that prong uh today
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I was wondering um
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with the
 
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:21.970 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with the
um

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:21.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
academic usage of the phrase rent
 
00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
seeking Behavior and the field of
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
economics and
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
um if so if you could talk about uh how
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
that relates to the um
 
00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:41.210 align:start position:0%
that relates to the um
more

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
General colloquial case
 
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:46.460 align:start position:0%
of rent that we're talking about here
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
I've definitely heard the the term and
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm aware I believe that it is
 
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.169 align:start position:0%
I'm aware I believe that it is
um

00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
it's not a good one right it's it's uh
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's I I might be stepping too far but
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
implies something that I might call
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
predatory but I admittedly can't you
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
know give you a wonderful academic
 
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.190 align:start position:0%

okay

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
okay

okay
um

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up question on that
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
or a second question
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
or well not on that specifically I'll
 
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
pass thank you any other questions
 
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
my my question is is that I understand
 
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:37.820 align:start position:0%
uh based on the language of this bill
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
that there will be a maximum amount and
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
owner of a restricted property can can
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
charge for rent my question is is what
 
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
then happens if the property is sold and
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
a new owner takes possession of the
 
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
property what how does the this bill
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
address that does the new owner inherit
 
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.049 align:start position:0%
address that does the new owner inherit
that

00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:03.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:03.649 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
rent limit fee limitation
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so my
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation certainly the intent but
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
I believe the the bill is written well
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh and my interpretation of how it is
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
written is consistent with my intent
 
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:21.059 align:start position:0%
that towns would be able to enable
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
regulations on rental practices in
 
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
general and so that applies to whoever
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
the owner is so if a property is sold
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
then you know it's within a town then
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's not like you know it it goes with
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
that owner it's not that you're you know
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
specifically regulating John Doe who
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
owns things and when John Doe doesn't
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
own things you're not regulating
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
anything because John Doe doesn't own
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
things you're regulating the owner of
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
the unit that is renting it out
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
whoever the owner happens to be you're
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
regulating the rental practice which
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
inherently means a restriction on what
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the owner is charging
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for taking my
 
00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:07.850 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for taking my
question

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
um the bill doesn't State any amounts
 
00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:14.539 align:start position:0%
which I assume to be intentional
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering
 
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what happens should this
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
bill pass and be signed into law
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
and a town or a city enacts bylaws
 
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this law
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
what are the guidelines
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
who knows who's who according to whom is
 
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
too much too much
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
so as I thank you for the question
 
00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:41.210 align:start position:0%
so as I thank you for the question
um

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
as I said and I don't think it can be
 
00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:45.769 align:start position:0%
as I said and I don't think it can be
overstated

00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
overstated
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
the incentive on town government any
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
official of the town government is to
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
get Revenue
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
restricting rental amounts especially if
 
00:32:57.769 --> 00:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
it's severe so just to be clear there's
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of different things that a town
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
can do that are not severe rent control
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
as we would call rent control there's
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
limiting rental increases to 15 percent
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
per year which is a kind of a mild rent
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
stabilization tactic there's changing
 
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
the notification period of rent
 
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
increases which doesn't affect the
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
amount at all but just says you know
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
maybe you need to give six months before
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
so there's all these different tools
 
00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:25.310 align:start position:0%
so there's all these different tools
available

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.409 align:start position:0%
available
um

00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:26.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
but at the thrust of my argument has
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
consistently been we from being from
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
disparate parts of the state cannot know
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
what's in the best interest of any one
 
00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
particular town the way that a town
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
government knows their own town the way
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
the town's people know their own town
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
and just to be very clear even though
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
this isn't the bylaws yes people would
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
show up and have their opinions heard
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
and certainly Town counselors Town
 
00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
select board City councilors would uh
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
would understand that their townspeople
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
would happily vote them out if they
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't go along with what they want so I
 
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
still expect a fair amount a good
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
healthy robust amount in fact of um
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
townspeople participation in whatever
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
comes but the incentive not only the
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what is in the best
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
interest of the town but the incentive
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
for the town government is revenue and
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
if you do severe caps that's going to
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
affect the market which is going to
 
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
devalue prices which will decrease
 
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.190 align:start position:0%
devalue prices which will decrease
Revenue

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
so that they're not at all predisposed
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
to doing this in fact I imagine it's
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
going to take quite the crisis in any
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
given town before a Town Council or a
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
select board is willing to do something
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative benchputi
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr tip thank you
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for taking my
 
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.869 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for taking my
question

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:53.879 --> 00:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.829 align:start position:0%
um
this

00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislation the way you're saying it is
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
if already something like this a similar
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
practice exists in a community
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
which is doing the best for their
 
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:12.849 align:start position:0%
which is doing the best for their
Community

00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:12.859 align:start position:0%
Community
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
would this change their approach or
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
would would it enable
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
that Community to adopt this without
 
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:25.700 align:start position:0%
majorly changing their bylaw or
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
whilst I certainly have not researched
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
all 320 municipalities in the state I
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
feel confident in the idea that there is
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
no municipality currently doing this
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
because municipalities are not currently
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
able to do this and should they pass
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
such a bylaw they would almost certainly
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
be challenged by the property owners of
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
their town and taken to to a to the
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to determine the
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
constitutionality and it's very clear
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
that they have to be enabled and it's
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
very clear that they have not been able
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
to do this so I am going to go out on a
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
limb a very very short easy strong Limb
 
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
and say no one is already doing this but
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
this does give those towns tools to to
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
okay any more questions we have a lot of
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
testimony to go if there are any more
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Reed
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have one representative
 
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
Reed I just want to
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
um follow up on representative Powers
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
question just a simple yes or no
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
um the intent of the legislation that if
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
the property is sold
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
the Restriction goes with the property
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about restrictions on
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
properties not the owner yes correct yes
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%

Ward 5 in Manchester
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
we in Manchester are facing an enormous
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
housing crisis
 
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.390 align:start position:0%
housing crisis
um

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
about 50 of the people who live in the
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester are renters a
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
significant number of them live in my
 
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.349 align:start position:0%
significant number of them live in my
district

00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
um currently in Hill in the state of New
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a two-bedroom apartment rents
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
for fifteen hundred dollars a month and
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
in Hillsborough County that number is
 
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
over eighteen hundred dollars a month
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and this is
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
um this this has had a a tremendous
 
00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:08.099 align:start position:0%
impact on our community our community
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
has a range of people at different
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
income levels for example South Willow
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
Street we did our our planning documents
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
earlier this year and an economist came
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
in and said that the city of Manchester
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
South Willow Street Corridor generates
 
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
about 15 billion dollars of Commerce the
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
people who make that happen are retail
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
workers who are making anywhere between
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
twelve and fifteen dollars an hour which
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
is not enough to afford rent in the city
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
of Manchester
 
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.349 align:start position:0%
of Manchester
um

00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
older people are also impacted since I
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
have been looking into this issue for
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
the last several years a number of
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
people have come to my attention retired
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
disabled people disabled veterans 75
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
year old woman who was being displaced
 
00:38:58.500 --> 00:38:59.569 align:start position:0%
year old woman who was being displaced
for

00:38:59.569 --> 00:38:59.579 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
um because someone new bought her
 
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
apartment ended up couch surfing for
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
several years before we could find
 
00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
housing for her so this is not limited
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
to young people it it is across the
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
board currently we have about 250 people
 
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
living on the street in Manchester and
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
you probably have seen the news about
 
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
the encampment in front of the families
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
in transition facility
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
um but there are hundreds more that are
 
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:29.420 align:start position:0%
living in cars or living in hotels
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
we just have a family in my neighborhood
 
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
that just moved in after spending
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
several years living in a hotel
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
um and other people are doubling up so
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
this is a huge crisis and
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
um it has had a devastating impact on
 
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
our on our city it doesn't just impact
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
the people who can't find housing it
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
impacts all of us because most of us
 
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.890 align:start position:0%
impacts all of us because most of us
um

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
are are um are struck by the level of
 
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
human suffering of the people who are
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
living on the streets or living in
 
00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.370 align:start position:0%
living on the streets or living in
hotels

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
hotels
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we say well the people that
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
living on the streets are are mentally
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
ill or addicted to drugs well
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
um you have to think about cause and
 
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.910 align:start position:0%
um you have to think about cause and
effect

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.690 align:start position:0%
effect
um

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
they may not have started out that way
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
but the stress of living on the streets
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
has caused them to turn to alcohol or
 
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
drugs in order to in order to survive
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
day to day
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
so you know you may hear a lot of uh
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
talk today about how the market will
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
solve the problem but that takes time
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
you know in Manchester currently our
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
city has
 
00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
um on plans to develop hundreds and
 
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
hundreds of units of of affordable
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
housing but it'll be years before that
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
happens in the meantime people are dying
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
on the street they're dying in cars
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
and this would be a tremendous tool for
 
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
us that would enable the city of
 
00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.150 align:start position:0%
us that would enable the city of
Manchester

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
um you know to Stave off some of this
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
human suffering that we are seeing in
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
our community
 
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.050 align:start position:0%
our community
and

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
um I would appreciate you know and I I
 
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
understand that there's a lot to it
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
unless having listened to um the sponsor
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
um but I please you know take this
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
seriously and the the situation in the
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the Mount Washington Valley is
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
different than the situation in Keene or
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
Nashville or
 
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
um so please give our our elected
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
officials in our communities the ability
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
to um to do something because they at
 
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
this point they're just saying there's
 
00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:35.099 align:start position:0%
nothing we can do thank you thank you
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative any questions

representative Stout
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%

sure okay next uh I have Joanne McIntyre
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Association
 
00:41:59.930 --> 00:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors again uh please
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh three minutes uh
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
Vice chair power will give you a
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
30-second warning we're going to have to
 
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
stick with this unfortunately we have a
 
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:11.339 align:start position:0%
lot of individuals
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
um so miss miss McIntyre go ahead good
 
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Joni McIntyre I'm a
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
realtor with Coldwell Banker J Hampe
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
Associates here in Concord I'm also the
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
president-elect of the New Hampshire
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors and I'm here
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire Realtors and
 
00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
first Realtors certainly recognize the
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
impetus behind this legislation vacancy
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
rates across the state are less than one
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
percent and like housing costs rents
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
have been rising rapidly
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire lower income
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
families are effectively priced out of
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
the housing market in most communities
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
even middle-income families find their
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
budgets stretched to provide adequate
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
housing for their families
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
however we think this bill could make
 
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
matters worse by constraining the
 
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
housing Supply even further and
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
therefore Realtors are opposed to it
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
the patchwork of ever-changing local
 
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
ordinances will not create fairer
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
housing market a fair housing market
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
instead it will reduce the quantity and
 
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
quality of available housing will
 
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
discourage new construction
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
increases increased rents for
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
unprotected tenants and create other
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
challenges for both landlords and
 
00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:33.650 align:start position:0%
challenges for both landlords and
tenants

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
the trend nationally over the past
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
decade has been to move away from this
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
sort of rent stabilization measure
 
00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:44.540 align:start position:0%
envisioned in HB 95.
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities currently have the
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
authority under State Statute to work
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
with developers in planning in the
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
planning stages to ensure a certain
 
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
number of units in an apartment complex
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
are retained as affordable
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
a developer might receive density bonus
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
or some other benefit
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
if they create such units
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
it is not it's not a perfect process
 
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
but for for-profit developers must
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
ensure a certain rate of return in order
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
to move forward with their development
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
other states with such rent
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
stabilization requirements have been
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
deferred have seen deferred maintenance
 
00:44:26.579 --> 00:44:28.370 align:start position:0%
deferred have seen deferred maintenance
abandonment

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
abandonment
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
lost tax revenues and widely varying
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
rents for similar Apartments
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
let's be honest in some communities
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
apartment developments are not even
 
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.770 align:start position:0%
apartment developments are not even
welcome

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's frustrating to hear such concerns
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
about apartments since they are such a
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
vital and integral part of ensuring New
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has adequate Workforce
 
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:53.540 align:start position:0%
it is not a largely to suggest that if
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
hb95 becomes law some towns will use
 
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
this new statute to create ordinances
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
designed to dissuade developers from
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
coming into their community
 
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
fewer opportunities for apartments in
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
will have devastating consequences
 
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
the answer to expanding housing Supply
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
is not more government regulations but
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
less we have to allow development to be
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
built more densely with faster approvals
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
I will also point out that Senate Bill
 
00:45:28.329 --> 00:45:28.339 align:start position:0%
47 was heard in the other body yesterday
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
that bill sets up a commission to review
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
the lack of affordable housing options
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
and barriers to more density in
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
construction we think the solution this
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to address is is better
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
Suited to to the studies Commission
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
the problem is lack of inventory and we
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
fear this bill will make matters worse
 
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
people your testimony are there any
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gallagher
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned other Solutions you
 
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.170 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned other Solutions you
prefer

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
um such as allowing more denser building
 
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.089 align:start position:0%
um such as allowing more denser building
so

00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:08.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
yeah if we've got Bill if we pass bills
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
to do those as well
 
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't that cancel out any of the
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
negative effects you see from
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh you see from this bill having like
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
studied and I think it's more important
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman go ahead
 
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I had the only
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
question I have uh you reference the
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
developers can take advantage of uh
 
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
density bonuses and and those kind of
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
things in their development of
 
00:46:59.329 --> 00:46:59.339 align:start position:0%
properties so they have to provide
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
affordable units
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
is there anything that ties them to
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
keeping those units affordable or do
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
they are they allowed to just flip them
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
to whatever they want later
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
I I really don't know the answer to that
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
question I imagine the municipality
 
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
could could state that in their
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
you know in offering that to a developer
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
represents Davis
 
00:47:29.569 --> 00:47:29.579 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
um I represent the city of Lebanon and
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
we have no shortage of developers coming
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
to our planning board wanting to build
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
none of them intend to include
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
affordable units in those buildings
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
in their parlance it doesn't pencil
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
you can't make a living if you have
 
00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:57.980 align:start position:0%
affordable units in your building
 
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
I recognize and understand that this is
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
a gordian knot type of problem with lots
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
of different aspects but my question to
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
you is
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
when you're talking to developers and I
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
assume that you do as a real estate
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
agent or or somebody in this field
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
what do you say to them when they say
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
well I'd love to include affordable
 
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:23.180 align:start position:0%
units in my
 
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:26.579 align:start position:0%
450 unit building that I'm going for the
 
00:48:29.089 --> 00:48:29.099 align:start position:0%
planning board to discuss but it doesn't
 
00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:30.770 align:start position:0%
planning board to discuss but it doesn't
pencil

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
pencil
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
what's your response to that
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
if you mean it doesn't pencil at the end
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
of the day we can't we can't make our
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
money back
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
I think that's a a big part of the
 
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
problem right now I don't have an answer
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
for that because if a developer can't
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
rent those units for an amount that they
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
can make their money they're not going
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
to build and I think you're seeing that
 
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.109 align:start position:0%
to build and I think you're seeing that
happening

00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:55.849 align:start position:0%
happening
um

00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:55.859 --> 00:48:58.010 align:start position:0%
um
I

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know what the
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
answer to that is their margins are very
 
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.569 align:start position:0%
answer to that is their margins are very
close

00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
close
 
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
um costs are so high but I do believe
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
that if we have more more inventory
 
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:11.990 align:start position:0%
that if we have more more inventory
um

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
lower lower cost units will come
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
available if and that will may allow for
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
more people to have you know sort of a
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
supply and demand situation you can't
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
you can't keep that inventory
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
so tight
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
that there's there's no room for more
 
00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:38.450 align:start position:0%
that there's there's no room for more
people

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony and taking my question as
 
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
a professional in in the field what
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
would you what do you determine what
 
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
affordable housing is
 
00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
you hear affordable housing affordable
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
housing what is it is it relation to the
 
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
size of the unit uh what what determines
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
what the unit is to go up the rental
 
00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
well I I I do know there's a number for
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing that that should be
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
and I can't tell you that that formula
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
right now but but when I talk about
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing I talk about what
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
what people can get into from an amount
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
that they can afford um
 
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339 align:start position:0%
in different places it will it will mean
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
different things
 
00:50:31.619 --> 00:50:32.690 align:start position:0%
different things
um

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
I do know that thirty two hundred
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
dollars a month in I have a tenant who
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
are not a tenant but a somebody looking
 
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
to buy thirty two hundred dollars a
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
month is not affordable
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and I heard somebody else say that
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
they had some you know 1800 in
 
00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.030 align:start position:0%
they had some you know 1800 in
Manchester

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:50.990 align:start position:0%
Manchester
um

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
or some people that would be affordable
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
or some people that would not be
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
affordable so I mean I I think the the
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
bottom line is more inventory is what's
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
most important
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.730 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
my question my question is uh increasing
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
density is one tool one prong of the
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
tool to address the issue
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
but currently
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
is there an enabling legislation if a
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
developer chooses to keep under for
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
example if there is uh inclusionary
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
zoning law in a particular Community if
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
they build over 50 units so they can
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
build under 50 units and not actually do
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
that so are there legislations that
 
00:51:51.849 --> 00:51:51.859 align:start position:0%
currently exist
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
not give incentive for the developer
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
to add more density
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
in that so inventory is reduced so would
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
I would this combat that kind of a
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
I don't really know if there's that type
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
of legislation I I really can't answer
 
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:17.210 align:start position:0%
of legislation I I really can't answer
that

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:23.900 align:start position:0%
yes over here
 
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to supply and demand the
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
certainly a cut in the supply of
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
apartment uh Apartments uh if the demand
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
is uh is stable then that's going to
 
00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.099 align:start position:0%
cause the Market Force will cause uh
 
00:52:51.049 --> 00:52:51.059 align:start position:0%
there to be an increase in rent what is
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
the impact as a real estate agent what
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
is the impact of people
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
turning their rental units into
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing do you see that here
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
in Concord and what's your experience as
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
a real estate agent uh across the state
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
so I generally work in this area in
 
00:53:18.839 --> 00:53:19.910 align:start position:0%
so I generally work in this area in
Concord

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I can honestly say I have not seen
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
an impact of that on the Concord rental
 
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.490 align:start position:0%
an impact of that on the Concord rental
market

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.329 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
so

00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:38.339 --> 00:53:39.530 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
back back to the
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
negative effects uh uh
 
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.770 align:start position:0%
negative effects uh uh
you

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
were talking about so if those negative
 
00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
effects do occur the municipalities
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
could just then
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
repeal these bylaws again then couldn't
 
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.990 align:start position:0%
repeal these bylaws again then couldn't
they

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
I guess they could I guess if that's
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:17.930 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
okay

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
um we are enforcing the three minutes
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
just so everybody here is aware
 
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.349 align:start position:0%
just so everybody here is aware
um one

00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
um one
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
one uh comment that I forgot to mention
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning uh those of you
 
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.410 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning uh those of you
who

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
are submitting testimony by sending it
 
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
to the email all committee members just
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
so you know that is not submitted
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that goes into the file you
 
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:42.660 align:start position:0%

testimony for it to become part of the
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
official record okay
 
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.130 align:start position:0%
official record okay
but

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative 11. good morning Mr

and find the portal on the general court
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
website easy to find very good there's
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
your answer
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
um next we have uh
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh not sure the first name but uh last
 
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for hearing my
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
testimony today my name is Kirsten
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
Cornell and I'm an attorney at New
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance and I'm here
 
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill today
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
and as part of my job I work with
 
00:55:34.569 --> 00:55:34.579 align:start position:0%
low-income tenants as a housing attorney
 
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
who oftentimes are facing evictions
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
we have up to 20 cases per week right
 
00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
now many times half of which are based
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
on an increase in rent that is at times
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
fifth an increase of 50 percent I've
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
seen a doubling of the amount of rent
 
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's being charged
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
this is resulting in not only
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
homelessness and not only people having
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go
 
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's also resulting in deaths and this
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
is not uncommon
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is about local control
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
it's about municipalities being able
 
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
to look at what is happening in their
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
communities and balance that with the
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
requirements that they have under
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
another statute which is RSA 165 the
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
local welfare statute which requires
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
cities to relieve and maintain the
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
residents in their municipalities if
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
they are to become homeless if they are
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
to need assistance with utilities and
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.370 align:start position:0%
things like that
as

00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:39.380 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
residents of municipalities increasingly
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
face homelessness or increasingly face
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
rents that are far exceeding their
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
income that places an economic burden on
 
00:56:53.329 --> 00:56:53.339 align:start position:0%
the municipality in order to relieve and
 
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
maintain those residents
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow municipalities to
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
balance the costs that they're facing
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
against the
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
regulations that they are putting into
 
00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099 align:start position:0%
place locally that again as has been
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out by a number of folks can be
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
repealed if an emergency situation does
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
no longer exist
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
there was a question about whether or
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
not this is an emergency situation or
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
what is an emergency situation there
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
have been at least two deaths due to
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
exposure to cold in the state of New
 
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just in the last few weeks
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
I have spoken personally with at least
 
00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
two tenants in the last two weeks who
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
have told me that they have not been
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
able to find an affordable place to go
 
00:57:41.569 --> 00:57:41.579 align:start position:0%
and because of that they're leaving the
 
00:57:41.579 --> 00:57:43.010 align:start position:0%
and because of that they're leaving the
state

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
if we want to have a state that grows
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
and develops
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
diversely and including you know
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
including diversity across age
 
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
we need to ensure that there are places
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I thank you for hearing my testimony
 
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.970 align:start position:0%
um I thank you for hearing my testimony
today

00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
um in terms of affordable housing I
 
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
think that we need to look at the
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
average minimum of what people are being
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
paid what they're able to afford and how
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
we want people to live
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.130 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
uh

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%

00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:58:34.609 --> 00:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
um are you a few years ago
 
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
um municipalities were given a number
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
for somebody houseless I won't call them
 
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
homeless but no roof over what they had
 
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:46.940 align:start position:0%
what it costs the
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities to take care of somebody
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have a it was a hundred
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year with all the
 
00:58:56.569 --> 00:58:56.579 align:start position:0%
support services that has to be plugged
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
in do you have any number at this point
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
I do not have a number at this point
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I imagine that I can get that
 
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
information if the committee would
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:10.500 align:start position:0%

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
this committee specifically to
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
the subject at hand and also I'm going
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people testifying if the point
 
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
has already been made if you can skip
 
00:59:32.809 --> 00:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
over that so we can get through these
 
00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
bills we've got at least another eight
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
or ten people to go representative L
 
00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:37.970 align:start position:0%
or ten people to go representative L
Word

00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
Word
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
um what type of expertise do you foresee
 
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
members of the governing body having to
 
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
have to develop these kind of bylaws
 
00:59:55.849 --> 00:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
legal economic what
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
you mean in terms of the those who would
 
00:59:59.930 --> 00:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
developed the bylaws is that what kind
 
01:00:02.329 --> 01:00:02.339 align:start position:0%
of expertise uh I imagine that they
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
would need to know their Community they
 
01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:06.059 align:start position:0%
would need to know
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
um what the vacancy rate is what the
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
cost of living is what a family needs in
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
order to be able to live safely and with
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
I have a partner
 
01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:26.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
would this be done by a community survey
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
would they have to hire an expert to
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
come in to evaluate I mean this is
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
rather subjective
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
I can't answer a question as to what
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities will do certainly I
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
imagine they could draw information from
 
01:00:42.299 --> 01:00:43.549 align:start position:0%
imagine they could draw information from
experts

01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
experts
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not in a position to State
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
what a Municipality Water would not do
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony next we
 
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.890 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony next we
have

01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
hey my name is Brandon Lemay I am from
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
representing rights and democracy uh we
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
are a member-led organization looking to
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
make Grassroots change at the local
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
state and federal level
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I want to be really quick today
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
because I feel like we've already gone
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
through a lot of the details of this
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation I'm speaking in uh
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
support of this uh and I want to kind of
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
reframe this conversation here because I
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
want to talk about another aspect that
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
this bill could actually help out with
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
and that is with making sure that we are
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
keeping up with housing standards in
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
terms of like quality of the housing so
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
for instance uh in Manchester where
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
currently they are packing up the
 
01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
biggest homeless encampment in the state
 
01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:45.980 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
could you stop your testimony again
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
could you please keep it to the subject
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
matter of the bill homelessness and yeah
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
please keep it to the bill yes yes thank
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
you representative uh yeah so I just
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
want to say that um this bill could be
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
used to make sure that uh that cities
 
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
and towns can enforce proper housing
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
standards so for instance a lot of the
 
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
tenants that I work with are facing
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
things like improper electrical wiring
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
uh unsafe Plumbing that's leaking
 
01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
causing mold and unfortunately there's
 
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
very little that the city of Manchester
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
can do to actually make sure that
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
landlords are keeping up with the
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
quality of their housing so I would like
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
to state that uh basically making sure
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
that people stay inside their Apartments
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
is one of the best ways to make sure
 
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
that they do not become homeless and in
 
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
order to keep housing stock available uh
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
it could be really beneficial to the
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester Chester to make sure
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
that we're enforcing housing quality
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
standards and I just want to emphasize
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is all about local control and
 
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that a rental practice
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
could make sense for North Conway and
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
Manchester we need to make sure that our
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
local leaders are setting standards that
 
01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:57.740 align:start position:0%
make sense for their communities
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes I think that there are
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
standards that wouldn't make sense all
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
across the state and this would just let
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
us us work with our aldermen to be able
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
to work on solutions that work for our
 
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
community and for us
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.809 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
yukela

01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
yukela
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.049 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
um there was some talk before about
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the evidence that someone might need
 
01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
to be able to put in a good
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
um bylaw
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in this law or that
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
would require such following of evidence
 
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.950 align:start position:0%
would require such following of evidence
or

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.789 align:start position:0%
or
um

01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:41.329 --> 01:03:41.339 align:start position:0%
or would someone be able to make a bad
 
01:03:41.339 --> 01:03:42.710 align:start position:0%
or would someone be able to make a bad
law

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
um by law using this language even
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
though they were advise that it would be
 
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
bad for their Community thank you for
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
I mean I believe that anybody can make a
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
bad law
 
01:03:59.329 --> 01:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
um but I think that I trust people to be
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
able to work with their local officials
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
and if their local officials make bad
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
laws then we can show them that on
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
so you know more questions thank you for
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you next we have
 
01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
Jane Huff or have like
 
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay good morning my name is Jane Hague
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
and I live in a 1573 Union Street in
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I'm a member of the
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
Manchester housing Alliance we're an
 
01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
activist group
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
and we have been attempting to
 
01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:39.380 align:start position:0%
understand the problem with housing
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
specifically in Manchester
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that I'm going to try to be
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
really brief because I think
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative Reed did a wonderful job
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
of introducing this bill and everything
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
that it's about and I just want to
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
emphasize that really we do have a
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
housing crisis in the state I've been
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
going to things like the business and
 
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
industry Council luncheons
 
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
and informational sessions and they
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's no affordable
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
housing for workers to live in that the
 
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
rental vacancy rate
 
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
in the state is less than one percent
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
and um so I think that this first of all
 
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
really is a housing crisis
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I do agree with the spokespersons for
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
the Realtors more apartments are needed
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think we need more cities and towns to
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
step up to the plate and allow for
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
construction and in Manchester we have
 
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.250 align:start position:0%
construction and in Manchester we have
seen

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:36.260 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
approvals by the Planning and Zoning
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
commissions to build more housing but
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a year or two really be
 
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
realistically before it's actually
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
complete and ready for occupancy
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime people are being
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
pushed out of their apartments and are
 
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
living in cars if they have a car or on
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
couches if they have a friend
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
so as a business and industry Council
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
says businesses need workers workers
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
need someplace to live that they can
 
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.650 align:start position:0%
need someplace to live that they can
afford

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
afford
 
01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.910 align:start position:0%
afford
um

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
the idea that if all these units come
 
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
online rents will suddenly become more
 
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
affordable it's really magical thinking
 
01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
I mean really I think it's up to the
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislature here to do something to
 
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
frankly the affordable units don't
 
01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:21.299 align:start position:0%
pencil out and I think that we're going
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
to have to come up with systems to
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
really subsidize developers to build
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
more but meanwhile I think this bill
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
does a lot to enable local control as
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative Reid said the local level
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
is where
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
some of these rules
 
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
um about rents need to take place that
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
can can serve during an emergency that
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're having for the next two or three
 
01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
or four years and then if it's not
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
needed anymore that they can be repealed
 
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:51.059 align:start position:0%
um I think it's especially egregious
 
01:06:51.059 --> 01:06:52.069 align:start position:0%
um I think it's especially egregious
when

01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
um buildings that have been long time
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
rentals on sometimes by older Manchester
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
or Statewide landlords people from
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
outside the state come in and buy them
 
01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.109 align:start position:0%
outside the state come in and buy them
up

01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
and raise the rents to as much as they
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
think that they can get and push out
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
longtime tenants even elderly and
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
disabled tenants
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I think we should really all be
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
appalled and try to think about what we
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
could do about that so thank you very
 
01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.970 align:start position:0%
could do about that so thank you very
much

01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you uh next we
 
01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.870 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you uh next we
have

01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%

I've been a landlord for 35 years I have
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
48 units I have a good amount of
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
expertise in this I also work with the
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
national Apartment Association at the
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
federal level this is a gigantic issue
 
01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:24.299 align:start position:0%
that landlords and landlord associations
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
are wrestling with in an across the
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
entire country
 
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
so first I want to tell you that
 
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
we have an essential problem of supply
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
and demand not enough Supply
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
and too much demand
 
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
so what I want you to
 
01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.169 align:start position:0%
so what I want you to
know

01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at helping to solve
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
what is being called the housing crisis
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
and you're not looking at increasing
 
01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.570 align:start position:0%
and you're not looking at increasing
Supply

01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
we need to create increase supply of
 
01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.669 align:start position:0%
we need to create increase supply of
housing

01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
that's the essential problem if you do
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
anything else then you have not
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
increased the supply of housing you will
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the problem
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
the market is is a force
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
it has its own life and dynamic you
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
can't squeeze a part of the force over
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
here and expect everything else to just
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
stay in place something's going to
 
01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:32.570 align:start position:0%
stay in place something's going to
happen

01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to just highlight a couple
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
things and I hope that you'll ask me a
 
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
lot of questions
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
we need to have the state working on
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
they rent control absolutely a failed
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
concept city after city after City
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
places that have had rent control
 
01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
ban it because it didn't work
 
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
St Paul Minnesota in 2022 instituted
 
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
their own rent control
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
new construction was down by 80 percent
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
right after that
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
we don't need to disincentify new
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
construction we need to incentify new
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you put in rent control then there's
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
no ability to adjust for increased costs
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
and as a property owner you can't know
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:37.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:41.510 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
a situation like what's proposing this
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill in different towns with different
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
regulations and then you have tenants
 
01:10:49.739 --> 01:10:50.930 align:start position:0%
regulations and then you have tenants
challenging

01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
the rent increases and you've got this
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
gigantic problem of knowing what every
 
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
Town's regulation is courts are already
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed I don't think you want to
 
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
have courts to have to
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
know every regulation in every town
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
across the board of economists
 
01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly agree that price controls
 
01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:12.620 align:start position:0%
on rent are ineffective
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
counterproductive lead to Serious
 
01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
negative impacts on the housing market
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
housing stock deteriorates there are 37
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
states in the United States that have
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
preemptions on rent control
 
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
it discourages new rental housing
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
imagine uh you know what happens is
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of times you'll see Property
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
Owners selling out and they'll sell it
 
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
like a mobile home park could could sell
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
their mobile home if you've got rent
 
01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
control what will happen to all those
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
mobile home renters
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
there's some studies in here that are
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at
 
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.530 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at
um

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
17 of them
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a summary from the
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
national Department Association showing
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
17 different studies in the past have
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
always shown rent control to fail
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
um I could talk for a long time but I
 
01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of people I have a
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
lot of expertise on this my contact info
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
is at the Top If you don't ask me a
 
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
question today I highly encourage you to
 
01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
contact me email me so we can talk about
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
this issue and I'd be very happy to take
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
questions and I have some answers for
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were asked
 
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were asked
already

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
actually uh we're gonna unless there's
 
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
any questions uh I will encourage
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
everybody to read that and contact you
 
01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:33.980 align:start position:0%
you're certainly open to uh
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative 11.
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I just want
 
01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
to know if you are aware that the New
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Authority partners
 
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Authority partners
with

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
tenants in mobile home parks that have
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
gone on the market and rather than
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
selling to a private owner
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
oftentimes and I don't have a number in
 
01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
front of me
 
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
the tenant group will be able to buy
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
that mobile home park and turn it into a
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
co-op where the tenants stay and have
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
control yeah I'm aware that there are
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.699 --> 01:13:11.090 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a couple of quick
 
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
questions how many units do you
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
currently uh myself personally have 48
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
units okay and how do you determine what
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
the appropriate rent is and make a
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable profit uh so what we so what
 
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
we do in my company and I think it's
 
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
true for almost any landlord is when I
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
have a good tenant
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
then we give them a very small increase
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
when I have a problem tenant they have a
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
higher increase
 
01:13:43.330 --> 01:13:43.340 align:start position:0%
and what happens is over the years
 
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
I've got tenants that have been in my
 
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
apartment for longer than I've owned
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
them I've had many candidates that have
 
01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:52.820 align:start position:0%
been there 20 years 10 years
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
many that are 10 to 15 years all those
 
01:13:59.209 --> 01:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
tenants of ours end up with rents that
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
are probably in the range of anywhere
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
from one to four hundred dollars less
 
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
than the market rate
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
when a tenant leaves then we put the
 
01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.219 --> 01:14:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you for
 
01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
oh yes please do uh I'm reminded that
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
when you speak say whether you're
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
opposed or for
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
committee for the first time my name is
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
Elliot Berry and for the first time in
 
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
47 years I come before you as a private
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
citizen for 47 years I pray I was a
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
housing specialist at New Hampshire
 
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:48.980 align:start position:0%
legal assistance where I represented
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
thousands thousands of tenants
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
I want to just make one thing that I
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
hope is clear whatever decision you make
 
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
on this bill please don't make it on the
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
basis of whether rent control is a good
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
or a bad idea
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
the question is is it such a horrible
 
01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
idea that the town shouldn't even be
 
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
allowed to consider it that's really
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
what's before you today there are people
 
01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
uh rent control has been attacked so
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
many times I'll just add a few things
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
that just in the last few years our
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
neighbors in Portland Maine have adopted
 
01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
it notwithstanding all of the anti-rent
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
control propaganda based so often on
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
studies that were contracted for by real
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
estate owners and developers in uh with
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
the state of Oregon has adopted
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
Statewide rent control
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're in the state or in the states of
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
New York and California literally
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
millions of tenants have been protected
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
so often senior citizens persons and to
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
say yeah persons of with disabilities
 
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
have been protected by these laws where
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
otherwise they clearly would have been
 
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
priced out of homes in which they've
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
lived in for ages
 
01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
but I think the debate needs to happen
 
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
on a market-by-market municipality by
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
municipality Portsmouth might consider
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
it Berlin's never going to consider it
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
um I also should take a moment to
 
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
apologize because if I had been a better
 
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
young lawyer maybe would we wouldn't be
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
here I actually was lead counsel in
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
defending the town of Allenstown who
 
01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
actually passed a mobile home park rent
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
Control Ordinance I couldn't make
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
convince the Supreme Court that the town
 
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
of Allentown had the ability to do that
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry we wouldn't be wasting your
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
time if I had been able to beat that let
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
me tell you though what I have actually
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
seen to give you an idea of why this is
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
even coming here today
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
these are actual clients that I've had
 
01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
uh KB in Nashua got a sudden notice of a
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
500 rent increase Daniel B his rent was
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
increased from fifteen hundred fifty
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
dollars to three thousand dollars so
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
there were two other uh Manchester
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
residents who had the same thing in that
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
complex a JT in hanaker a twelve hundred
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
Ten Dollar rent increase Liz Marie I
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
forgot to note where she lived 950 rent
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
increase a Lake State in Nashua 550
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
increase think about if you all I think
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
probably most of you are homeowners if
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
you got 60 days 45 days 30 days notice
 
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
that your mortgage payment was going to
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
go up 500 or fifteen hundred dollars
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
what would that do to you and you are
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
literally talking about people who are
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
being dispersed God knows where in a
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
state with a with a vacancy rate of one
 
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
half of one percent being dispersed all
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
over the state or out of the state these
 
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
are very very terrible times let me just
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
add one more thing when you talk about
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
rent control it's not one thing it can
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
be whatever is designed subject to
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional limits of due process New
 
01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:23.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's right to property uh and
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
so it could be you could exempt new
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
construction you could exempt small you
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
know landlords with small Holdings you
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
could do there are so many different
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
ways that this can be done and there are
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
little literally about a hundred local
 
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
current ordinances across the country
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
that decision makers can use uh to pick
 
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
as models with such local modifications
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
as um you deem appropriate so again I
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
just urge you
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and again they can Sunset them too
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
which is probably the most important
 
01:18:59.219 --> 01:19:00.590 align:start position:0%
which is probably the most important
thing

01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:03.659 align:start position:0%
um so the bottom line is whether you
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
think about yeah a little excess of what
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to a lot so we're going to
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
hold your testimony there is there any
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
questions representative majority thank
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
question I said on my local planning
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
board did I hear did I hear correctly
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
and understand that either the select
 
01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
board which I also sit on or the
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
planning board could allow for a
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
variance for a landlord or a waiver
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
against the increase based on certain
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
conditions well I know that's not what I
 
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
was suggesting but the ordinance itself
 
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
could be structured to guarantee and
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
should be a fair net operating income
 
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
for the if it doesn't do that then it's
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
probably going to be unconscious it will
 
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
be unconstitutional so but any waivers
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
would be in the ordinance or any
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
adjustments would be within the Contours
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Keller
 
01:19:59.330 --> 01:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
question you uh criticized some studies
 
01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659 align:start position:0%
that might have been
 
01:20:03.659 --> 01:20:05.030 align:start position:0%
that might have been
um

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
um contracted by real estate firms do
 
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
you know of any or do you have any uh
 
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
studies to provide the committee that
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
were contracted by renters
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
I should uh probably more by academics
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
but I could certainly I don't know off
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but I'd be very happy
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
to get that information to you thank you
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
and but again I'm just not saying it's
 
01:20:27.649 --> 01:20:27.659 align:start position:0%
whether it's good or bad the question is
 
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
whether it's so bad that it ought to be
 
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.130 align:start position:0%
whether it's so bad that it ought to be
verbose

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
verbose
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for your testimony okay
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
next we have uh Jessica marjason
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.209 --> 01:20:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
my name is Jessica marjason I am here
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
um representing myself I am from
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and I am for
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
the reasons I am for this bill
 
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
um could you could you pull that
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
microphone a little closer too so we can
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
hear you better I apologize
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
I am a tenant organizer with Granite
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
State organizing project where I run a
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
tenant Clinic every Wednesday so I see
 
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:20.219 align:start position:0%
firsthand constantly how this would help
 
01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
many communities I also am helping
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
organize Westgate Salem tenants in Salem
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
and I see how Salem operates different
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
from Manchester I've helped those in
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
Ossipee with my clinic and I see how
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
their resources are different from our
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
town in Manchester every town across our
 
01:21:38.209 --> 01:21:38.219 align:start position:0%
state is widely different with resources
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
available for the City Welfare Offices
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
in what I am seeing across the state is
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the homeless shelters filled
 
01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
so this is why it would help I'm also on
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
the Manchester housing commission why
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
this would help me in the commission
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
with my role is I am I've been asking
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
what units do we have in our town what
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
do we need because I feel that a
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
majority of our naturally occurring
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
affordable housing was decimated by
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
predatory landlords with the renovation
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
addictions we experienced over the last
 
01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
two years we sit on numbers that we had
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
in our head two years ago but failed to
 
01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
realize half of those were wiped out
 
01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
with this we need new numbers and I
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
can't get new numbers from the
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
assessor's office either because the
 
01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
assessor sends out a survey only a few
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
of those respond I have nothing to go to
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
to see the numbers of what our city has
 
01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
and what we desperately need
 
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
um I also created and helped organize
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
and run the
 
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
Granite State tenants Association we
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
have come together we are 60 plus strong
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
currently new are getting added every
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
week we meet the second Saturday of
 
01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
every month but I get to see residents
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
from across our state and they tell me
 
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
what's happening in their City another
 
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
thing that has not been mentioned is
 
01:22:59.810 --> 01:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
fraud this bill could help with fraud I
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
have one client that I just met with
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
recently and she's coming to my clinic
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
today when I go back to the office her
 
01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
rent was raised from 2200 to 3 800
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
because she had the nherap the New
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire emergency rental assistance
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
program that offered rental assistance
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
to many of our residents that could not
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
afford the ever increasing rent
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
how this could help is this landlord
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
took this person's rent from 2200 a
 
01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
month to 3 800 a month to be able to get
 
01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:32.219 align:start position:0%
the extra money while they could and
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
luckily through text messages let her
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
know that after the program was done he
 
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
would lower her back down to 2200 a
 
01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:39.830 align:start position:0%
would lower her back down to 2200 a
month

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
set things give them more time they
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't quickly just change it our
 
01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
rents are so high my tenants don't have
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
enough time to find something
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester's 0.3 for vacancy everyone
 
01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
keeps mentioning below one it's point
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
three our county is 0.4 and it's not
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
that much different when you go around
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
so each City or municipality being able
 
01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
to step forth what they need is highly
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
beneficial for many different reasons
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%

thank you Kathy Holmes I am
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%

name down on this Norman's paper because
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%

um I can make my two minutes probably
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
one minute because of his writing and I
 
01:24:58.490 --> 01:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
want you to watch out for the buzzwords
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
used by the other side crisis and
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
emergency and we need to speedily do
 
01:25:03.719 --> 01:25:04.790 align:start position:0%
emergency and we need to speedily do
something

01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.350 align:start position:0%
something
these

01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
these don't
 
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
um they're only meant to motivate people
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
emotionally and we know whenever
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
government gets involved things get
 
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
ruined and the more power you give to
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
government whether it's local or big and
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of these um extra costs are from
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
DC the big government and the energy
 
01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
costs what's the landlord supposed to do
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
if they're paying the energy bills in
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
the rent then things have to happen
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
because landlords can't Subs can't be
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
the socialism that you want
 
01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:42.890 align:start position:0%
the socialism that you want
so

01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:43.669 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%

with two or three hundred apartments in
it

01:26:59.570 --> 01:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
and they sell it to an outside person
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
and that outside person kicks everybody
 
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
out because they're going to renovate
 
01:27:09.169 --> 01:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
them all and you have an option when it
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
comes back on board to come back but
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
your rent goes up 300 percent what
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
happens to that renter
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
give another example
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
I pay rent
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
I had three heart attacks this year and
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
pneumonia I lost a lot of income because
 
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
I couldn't go to work
 
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
graciously I'm back at work but I have a
 
01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:32.689 align:start position:0%
graciously I'm back at work but I have a
a

01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
seasonal jobs from January to April I do
 
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
very little work there's no work
 
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
you still have to pay the rent the rent
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
went up three hundred dollars in
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
September this January they tried to
 
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
re-raise the rent another 200 yet we
 
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
have a lease
 
01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm on Section Eight Section 8 isn't
 
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
going to pay no more because their their
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
contract says once a year
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
so there is predatory not by everyone
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
this has got to stop this may not solve
 
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
the entire solution but it's going to
 
01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:14.219 align:start position:0%
stop a lot of it and when it comes to
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
raising rent or not
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
if you have too much unaffordable rent
 
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
that people can't afford to pay
 
01:28:24.169 --> 01:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
you have to have in Manchester so much
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
so that other towns and cities in New
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and across the country send
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
their people to Manchester
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
so it becomes the city has the burden
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
and what does that do it raises your
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
taxes so for those of you who can't
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
can't afford to pay your taxes here it
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
goes that's not the solution
 
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
our state constitution States precisely
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
that every Community must take care of
 
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
its own people
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
we now have kids being born in tense and
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
left there
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
the state has failed a lot of our
 
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.310 align:start position:0%
the state has failed a lot of our
children

01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
because of poverty it's time for change
 
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
this is a beginning so yes I am in favor
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
of this it doesn't solve all there used
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
to be a time in Manchester that if you
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
build an apartment building you could
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
negotiate how many affordable housing
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
you would have that doesn't exist
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
anymore so there is no affordable
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
housing what is Affordable if your rent
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
goes up above 50 percent and your income
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
does not change my incomes come down two
 
01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:33.980 align:start position:0%
years in a row yet my rent is going up
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
tremendously that means eventually I
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
will become homeless thank you any
 
01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh representative true 11
 
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
roulette for taking my question I'm
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could just tell me
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
what's included in your rent currently
 
01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.930 align:start position:0%
what's included in your rent currently
uh

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh the only utility that's included is
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
the Heat and it's neighbor works it's a
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
federal housing
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
it's I live in the federal housing
 
01:30:02.219 --> 01:30:04.430 align:start position:0%
it's I live in the federal housing
project

01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
rental only the heat I have to pay
 
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
electricity if it's gone up over a
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
hundred and something percent
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
seeing uh no other questions uh I
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
believe this will be our last testimony
 
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee I'll
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
do a significant surgery on my comments
 
01:30:36.169 --> 01:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
and submit them in writing later my wife
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I own 10 units in the Upper Valley
 
01:30:40.450 --> 01:30:40.460 align:start position:0%
which we have bought one at a time since
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
1989. we don't get a choice at this
 
01:30:46.129 --> 01:30:46.139 align:start position:0%
point as to which municipality we're
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
going to invest in we're in it our costs
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
keep going up and regulating our income
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
without regulating our cost makes no
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
more sense than regulating the price of
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
eggs or why not regulate the price that
 
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
you make on a profit selling a single
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
I'll speak against this motion for the
 
01:31:12.169 --> 01:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
main reason that rent control just does
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
not work and I'll get into the details
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
in my written uh statements many many of
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
them have been to me this morning but I
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
would note that our friends South of the
 
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
Border in Massachusetts repealed their
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
rent control laws in 1994. unfortunately
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
bad ideas tend to pop back up in every
 
01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
generation and here we go again
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
the solution is more units more
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
construction and only more units as was
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
stated previously if we don't work on
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
the supply the rest of this just
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
restricts Supply it doesn't increase
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
I also said as the chair of the of the
 
01:31:48.490 --> 01:31:48.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire building code review board
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
we have passed amendments this year
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
they're in the ratification process now
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
to reduce the cost of some alterations
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
permitting lower cost changes to
 
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
residential uses uh everybody seems to
 
01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
agree that much of the problem sits on
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
the zoning side so I would suggest that
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
that's where the solution may be
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll call it a day for for now
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative 11.
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm not trying to be
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
a pain thank you so much for taking my
 
01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.930 align:start position:0%
a pain thank you so much for taking my
question

01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
um do you think there's more than one
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
I can only look at this from the view of
 
01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
a small business person me and my wife
 
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
who bought these units based on our
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
expectation that we would be free to
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
charge what we need to charge
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
I would mention that our rents
 
01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
didn't even keep up with inflation for
 
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
several years and they spiked in the
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
last couple of years
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
but if you draw that curve from when we
 
01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
bought them until now and they're
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
probably closer to inflation
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the problem much like
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
the prices of single-family homes
 
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
I see no further questions thank you
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony
 
01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
are there any other pink cards that have
 
01:33:20.810 --> 01:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
not been turned in or anybody who wishes
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
why don't you come up and uh if you if
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
just come and testify and then fill out
 
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
um hi my name is Kate West and I am in
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
01:33:48.649 --> 01:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
uh to me it does often seem as though uh
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
will say you know we don't want
 
01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
regulations because it will impact our
 
01:33:58.209 --> 01:33:58.219 align:start position:0%
profit but when you can afford to own
 
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
multiple properties I think that you do
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to run them in a
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
way that is helpful to your community
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
not exploitive folks that often are like
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
you can't regulate this
 
01:34:16.729 --> 01:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
usually are trying to exploit the people
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
around them that's why the regulations
 
01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
are necessary
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
it also again if you cannot own more
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
than one property without
 
01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:29.420 align:start position:0%
exploiting the people in your community
 
01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
maybe you shouldn't own those properties
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
landlords feel very comfortable saying
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
if you can't afford to pay rent maybe
 
01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't have a place to live but
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't often apply that logic to whether
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
or not they should own more than one
 
01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.570 align:start position:0%
or not they should own more than one
place

01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
to live
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
a strong
 
01:34:58.490 --> 01:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
urge to ask our community members with
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
wealth and property to really think
 
01:35:00.719 --> 01:35:01.970 align:start position:0%
wealth and property to really think
about

01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
what they're doing when they are raising
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
the cost to be housed to a point where
 
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
folks that
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
maybe make the minimum wage in our
 
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
community to the point where they can't
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
afford to be housed
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no more I have no more
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
pink cards make sure you fill out a pink
 
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
card for us please I'll close the
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on HV 95 uh let's take five
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
minutes and then we'll come back and get
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.460 --> 01:41:02.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay folks we're gonna get going on the
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%

forgot to formally introduce myself last
 
01:41:45.050 --> 01:41:45.060 align:start position:0%

01:41:57.530 --> 01:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
um registry of deeds that we currently
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%

have on the county level a registry of
rents

01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
the reason this is necessary and I I
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
won't repeat my testimony in terms of
 
01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
the problem from from the last bill and
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
I went to Mr chair
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
um but we do have a predatory situation
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
right now where very frequently
 
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
um people who buy these properties are
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
raising the rents I think I told you in
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
my town a thousand dollar raises were
 
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
happening but you've heard other
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
testimony to that so I'll leave it to
 
01:42:33.649 --> 01:42:33.659 align:start position:0%
you to understand that that's happening
 
01:42:36.729 --> 01:42:36.739 align:start position:0%
but that it's predatory in the nature
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
that there those increases are being
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
blamed on this nebulous thing called the
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
market which I understand there are
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
obviously real Market forces at work as
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
with everything in our economy but when
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's a very convenient cover and it
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
turns out you are in fact paying well
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
over Market
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
um rates for the property you're buying
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
and yet still
 
01:43:03.729 --> 01:43:03.739 align:start position:0%
increasing the rents on people
 
01:43:06.669 --> 01:43:06.679 align:start position:0%
then effectively what we call renovation
 
01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
evicting them for renovations and then
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
doing renovations and increasing it
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
again and you're still making a healthy
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
healthy profit then the question becomes
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
so if you're already paying over Market
 
01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
rates how is this the market
 
01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
how is this the market and what part is
 
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
predatory what part is opportunistic
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
what parts being blamed on the market
 
01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
when it's not actually simply an
 
01:43:31.209 --> 01:43:31.219 align:start position:0%
increase of cost could you speak
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
specifically yes to this place I was
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
speaking to the need for it thank you
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so while we do have already a very
 
01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.570 align:start position:0%
um so while we do have already a very
close

01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
um following of the information every
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
single property in existence
 
01:43:46.159 --> 01:43:47.709 align:start position:0%
single property in existence
is

01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
logged we know every single property is
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
capable of being sold or may be sold in
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
the future capable of being bought and
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
so we have all of that information
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
whenever it's changed hands we don't
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
have any of that information for the
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
rental amounts and if you think about it
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
in general Mark it's kind of weird it's
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
like the only thing that's kind of
 
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
secretive in a lot of ways and generally
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
when we think about the economy we know
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
what for example the average price of
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
eggs is or the average gallon of gas or
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
milk or what have you but we don't have
 
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
nice data to to go to in order to follow
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
what rental amounts actually are and be
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
able to discern the difference between
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
what is market and what is simply
 
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
opportunistically blamed on the market
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
and I do want to raise a point that was
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
raised earlier but because it's it's
 
01:44:43.129 --> 01:44:43.139 align:start position:0%
relative to this
 
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
um some of that predatory behavior that
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would seek to be able to
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
identify by seeing what the rents are is
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
some of that uh Behavior I think one of
 
01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
the representatives call it rents
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
thinking Behavior but essentially what
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
was called fraud which is we have a
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.090 align:start position:0%
number of
um

01:45:01.090 --> 01:45:01.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
non-profits that help people if they are
 
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
in rental crisis and the landlords know
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
this and so they increase the rent
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
knowing that those tenants can then go
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
get that assistance and in fact the
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
landlord specifically in my town that
 
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
was causing so much problems was
 
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
specifically referring people to that
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
new every bit everything that those uh
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
those programs provided how long they
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
would provide it for how much it could
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
be renewed so this would also this this
 
01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
is in in essence is transparency at its
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
core it's simple transparency and
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
anytime you bring something out into the
 
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
sunlight you can help to uncover and
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
therefore combat fraud like that
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
so as I said we already do this with
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
property ownership it wouldn't be that
 
01:45:48.169 --> 01:45:48.179 align:start position:0%
much more data being dealt with and all
 
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
of it would be self-reported by the
 
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
landlords themselves so it's not
 
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
um like somebody going and finding out
 
01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
this information it's filed by the
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
landlords so uh it wouldn't be an an
 
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
onerous increase in duties and whatever
 
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
was increased that needed to be handled
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh labor can easily be
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
overcome by a very modest fee for filing
 
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine something like five
 
01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
dollars would be enough for all the
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
rental units if they're all filed would
 
01:46:20.689 --> 01:46:20.699 align:start position:0%
be enough to cover the extra paperwork
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
necessary so like I said every single
 
01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
property is already registered not all
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
properties are rented right so you're
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
talking about fewer than the total
 
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
number that they already do
 
01:46:36.729 --> 01:46:36.739 align:start position:0%
so I do I have become aware that someone
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
a detractor uh said that they actually I
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
think it's kind of funny that they
 
01:46:42.239 --> 01:46:43.550 align:start position:0%
think it's kind of funny that they
actually

01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
um said they thought this would add to
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
price fixing when that's in fact the
 
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
behavior that this seeks to uncover with
 
01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:52.490 align:start position:0%
behavior that this seeks to uncover with
transparency

01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
um so the effect that we're experiencing
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
right now is in effect price fixing but
 
01:46:58.450 --> 01:46:58.460 align:start position:0%
true price fixing is when two
 
01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
competitors go behind closed doors and
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
agree to keep their prices High because
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
there's no incentive for them to have
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
lower prices and as long as they agree
 
01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
to not compete and try to out price each
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
other they can keep it high specifically
 
01:47:14.109 --> 01:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
with housing this is particularly
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
effective because you have people over a
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
barrel there's no uh housing is an
 
01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
inelastic cost people have to have it so
 
01:47:26.689 --> 01:47:26.699 align:start position:0%
there's no like well I don't need your
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
product so I'm just gonna go away you
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
know you have to have it and you have to
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
pay it so because of that that this
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
transparency is actually required that's
 
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
the actual reason it's required in terms
 
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
of actually people getting together and
 
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
making those price fixing deals that's
 
01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
not you know nothing is happening now to
 
01:47:46.490 --> 01:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening and nothing
 
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
in this bill would increase that
 
01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.149 align:start position:0%
in this bill would increase that
happening

01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:47:50.159 --> 01:47:51.229 align:start position:0%
happening
um

01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
so I think I've gone through almost all
 
01:47:59.450 --> 01:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
my points here I'm happy to open up to
 
01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:02.109 align:start position:0%
my points here I'm happy to open up to
questions

01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative L Word
 
01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
01:48:12.530 --> 01:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
the bill only lists
 
01:48:15.169 --> 01:48:15.179 align:start position:0%
maybe two data points that would be
 
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
collected to formulate this registry and
 
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
that being the monthly amount of rent
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I I assume the address right what
 
01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
other data points do you foresee being
 
01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
collected so a county could choose to
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
collect square footage of the unit
 
01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
um potentially could choose to select a
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
key number of amenities if they so chose
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the discretion of
 
01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
the county but at a bare minimum because
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
we do already have square footage for a
 
01:48:49.609 --> 01:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
lot of addresses anyway
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
um address and Rental amount would be
 
01:48:55.129 --> 01:48:55.139 align:start position:0%
the most important pieces
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
may I follow up Mr chairman
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead follow up
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
so essentially If I'm renting a unit
 
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
someone can go log on to registry of
 
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
deeds or go to the office look up the
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
address and find out how much I'm paying
 
01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
in rent correct and that correct and
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
that would be very in theory unless your
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
landlord was doing something
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
off thank you but that is the very
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
similar to how you can currently look up
 
01:49:26.209 --> 01:49:26.219 align:start position:0%
and see when a property was last sold to
 
01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
the current owner and how much they paid
 
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
represent uh representative majority
 
01:49:34.729 --> 01:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative for taking a question uh
 
01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
I don't see any enforceability in in
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
this or punitive actions should somebody
 
01:49:43.729 --> 01:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
not register do you have any
 
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
anticipation for that or any have you
 
01:49:47.209 --> 01:49:47.219 align:start position:0%
thought about that
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
so as you know when you're submitting
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
bills if you add punitive things it
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
makes it less likely to pass and then
 
01:49:55.609 --> 01:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of arguments about that
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
those punishments being onerous in order
 
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
to keep this as simple as possible I
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
didn't add it it is something I thought
 
01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:02.930 align:start position:0%
didn't add it it is something I thought
about

01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
um of course at all times we have civil
 
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
action available to us
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:50:18.649 --> 01:50:18.659 align:start position:0%
um my question is this act shall take
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
effect in 60 days have you reviewed this
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
with the counties about how they would
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
enact this and
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
and put this into their system already
 
01:50:29.209 --> 01:50:29.219 align:start position:0%
because a lot of our systems are have
 
01:50:31.129 --> 01:50:31.139 align:start position:0%
difficulties already
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
I have not specific and I that's right I
 
01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
feel so rude uh talking to the side of
 
01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
the speaker but
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I have not conferred with any
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
particular County on the limitations of
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
their systems having said that they
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
already have to deal with every single
 
01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:51.179 align:start position:0%
property in their County so I don't
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
think that this would be much more data
 
01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
that they have to add thank you
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Tetro do you have a
 
01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:01.490 align:start position:0%
representative Tetro do you have a
question

01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for being
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
here to answer our questions
 
01:51:06.239 --> 01:51:08.450 align:start position:0%
here to answer our questions
um

01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
just for
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
how many rental units does Manchester
 
01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:16.189 align:start position:0%
how many rental units does Manchester
have

01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
how many rental units in Manchester I
 
01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:21.179 align:start position:0%
don't represent Manchester I represent
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
New Market in new fields and admittedly
 
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you exactly how many rental
 
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
units are in New Market either but um
 
01:51:30.649 --> 01:51:30.659 align:start position:0%
it's in the order of hundreds
 
01:51:30.659 --> 01:51:32.290 align:start position:0%
it's in the order of hundreds
okay

01:51:32.290 --> 01:51:32.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:35.450 --> 01:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you
 
01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:38.330 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you
um

01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:39.890 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
I don't see where this would accomplish
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
what your looking for it looks like a
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm expressing an opinion here
 
01:51:49.850 --> 01:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
and I shouldn't be
 
01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:50.570 align:start position:0%
and I shouldn't be
um

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:53.649 --> 01:51:53.659 align:start position:0%
how do you see
 
01:51:53.659 --> 01:51:55.609 align:start position:0%
how do you see
municipalities

01:51:55.609 --> 01:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
oh I'm assuming you're going to have
 
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities collect this information
 
01:52:05.450 --> 01:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
in the registry of deeds or counties
 
01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:06.649 align:start position:0%
in the registry of deeds or counties
um

01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
who's paying for this
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
so thank you for allowing me to clarify
 
01:52:14.209 --> 01:52:14.219 align:start position:0%
um so no I don't foresee municipalities
 
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
or really anyone in the active sense
 
01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
collecting the information I foresee
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
landlords being that it's a requirement
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
and statute without a punitive uh stick
 
01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
so to speak but landlords uh obeying the
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
law and self-reporting to the county so
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
not the towns but the county the county
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
already collects information on all
 
01:52:37.609 --> 01:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
properties in terms of ownership and
 
01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
whenever they're sold not every property
 
01:52:43.010 --> 01:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's owned gets rented so you're
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
talking about a smaller number of
 
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
properties that are actually rented out
 
01:52:48.850 --> 01:52:48.860 align:start position:0%
so it's less than what the current
 
01:52:52.609 --> 01:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
registry contains thank you
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
oh and the fee to answer the last part
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
of your question if the county so it
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
shows although it's not a lot of extra
 
01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
work they could Institute a small filing
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.090 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair before I have a
 
01:53:12.189 --> 01:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
question I have a question for the chair
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh the blue sheet do you uh let us know
 
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
after each bill how many opposed and how
 
01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:20.810 align:start position:0%
after each bill how many opposed and how
many

01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful thank you
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's a good reminder thank you thank
 
01:53:24.719 --> 01:53:25.790 align:start position:0%
that's a good reminder thank you thank
you

01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
um my question thank you for taking my
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
question representative Reed
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
currently many of the assessing uh
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
assessor's office do have online where
 
01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
we can check the property
 
01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
so would that would this require
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
opt-in if we as an owner can
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
you know say the intention changes from
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
owner occupied to rental oh yes I I
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
completely foresee that and of course as
 
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
with all bills there's certain things
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
that you put in statute and certain
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
things you leave to the administrative
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
level I would obviously presume that
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
that is included in you know they
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
already have owner occupied data so if
 
01:54:18.169 --> 01:54:18.179 align:start position:0%
it's being rented out that's what I want
 
01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
to add but if it reverts back to owner
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
occupied then there would be a method
 
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:27.530 align:start position:0%
for that
foreign

01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
I am not in any way restricting the data
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
that that the counties are collecting I
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
am saying that they need to at least set
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
a bare minimum collect rental amounts
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:54:42.350 --> 01:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
question it's kind of two parts
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:50.219 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds is like keeping
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
track of like legal documents
 
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
um and so I wonder what type of legal
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
document you think that
 
01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.270 align:start position:0%
document you think that
um

01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
would be required or are you thinking
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
that this is just like a form that they
 
01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
have to fill out and have notarized or
 
01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
something like that and then given to
 
01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:11.209 align:start position:0%
something like that and then given to
the

01:55:11.209 --> 01:55:11.219 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't even foresee it needing to be
 
01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
notarized it would be the creation of a
 
01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
legal document if you'd like to look at
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
it that way and and to representative
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
Magnum Booty's uh point I think she said
 
01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
something about online to the extent
 
01:55:25.609 --> 01:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
that counties already have the ability
 
01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
to collect the current data online that
 
01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
would be an easy thing for them to
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
increase on their website just say if
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
you are a rent if you rent out a
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
property in this County you have to
 
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
yearly put in the amount that you're
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
renting in the address you're renting it
 
01:55:42.890 --> 01:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
at so it would just be input of data
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's you know if you want to look at it
 
01:55:48.169 --> 01:55:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:50.219 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up go ahead and follow up
 
01:55:52.129 --> 01:55:52.139 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
if it's not notarized or anything like
 
01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:55.669 align:start position:0%
if it's not notarized or anything like
that

01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:59.450 --> 01:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
um could uh what would be the control I
 
01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
guess for me putting in a form that says
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
you put in uh you know you're you're now
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
renting your house for five million
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
dollars a month how is that enforced
 
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean back to the enforcement
 
01:56:15.649 --> 01:56:15.659 align:start position:0%
principle there's a reason I didn't want
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
to come down like too specific because
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
it tends to hurt bills to do that but
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
having said that just like every form
 
01:56:24.890 --> 01:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
that you sign ever it's usually
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
something above that goes I state that
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
all the above information is true to the
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge and then you sign
 
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
it so that's uh or an electronic
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
signature when you do things online but
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's um I mean I'm filing for
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
unemployment right now and then I have
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
to do an electronic signature this is
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
kind of a new I would like to ask a
 
01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
question on a new different topic not a
 
01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:50.689 align:start position:0%
question on a new different topic not a
follow-up

01:56:50.689 --> 01:56:50.699 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
we'll go to a different come back come
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
back representative Guthrie yes thank
 
01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:55.729 align:start position:0%
back representative Guthrie yes thank
you

01:56:55.729 --> 01:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for taking my question
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman is this uh bill
 
01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh a a an attempt to correct bad conduct
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's an attempt to get the data
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
necessary to identify the Bad actors and
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bad conduct so I not correct but
 
01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:19.430 align:start position:0%
the bad conduct so I not correct but
identify

01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative 11. thank you Mr chair
 
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Reed for
 
01:57:28.189 --> 01:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
um you just answered part of it the rest
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
of it is can you can you give me an idea
 
01:57:37.129 --> 01:57:37.139 align:start position:0%
of besides collecting the data
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
what else this is
 
01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
um what your intent is to file this bill
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
and the benefit to the public
 
01:57:48.290 --> 01:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
so I I think I was clear that the the
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
collection of data for transparency's
 
01:57:53.689 --> 01:57:53.699 align:start position:0%
sake I mean somebody had said something
 
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
about like well why is why is housing so
 
01:57:58.609 --> 01:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
special we have all these other products
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
but housing is almost everybody's
 
01:58:03.169 --> 01:58:03.179 align:start position:0%
certainly low to moderate but most
 
01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
people's number one expense and it's
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely required so getting that
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
transparency on something that's that
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
vital to individuals to communities is
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
important so I mean I don't have any
 
01:58:18.350 --> 01:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
other motive in that other than what
 
01:58:20.450 --> 01:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
I've already expressed that collecting
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
that data for transparency's sake so
 
01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
that we can see when actors are being
 
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
predatory and what it really is truly
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
the market
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you may I have a follow-up Mr
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
chair you may go ahead follow up
 
01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
um following up
 
01:58:38.689 --> 01:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I'm a real estate broker
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
in my other life I have been for 35
 
01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
years and when people come to me as a
 
01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
buyer or a seller I generally don't deal
 
01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
with rentals I mean I talk to them and
 
01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
give them information and refer them to
 
01:58:51.649 --> 01:58:51.659 align:start position:0%
someone who can help them
 
01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
what I want to say is the
 
01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
the buyer may come with that tax card on
 
01:59:00.410 --> 01:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
which is recorded what it sold for when
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
it sold oftentimes it doesn't matter one
 
01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
wit because the market has changed so
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
how will this help a renter
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
to see what is really fair and what is
 
01:59:15.050 --> 01:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
really not fair in regards to rental
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
prices right so for example if you can
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
see that all the comparables the
 
01:59:23.709 --> 01:59:23.719 align:start position:0%
comparables in the area are renting for
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
1200 and then one guy comes in and it's
 
01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
1800 and that's an exaggerated uh
 
01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
example because what we're seeing
 
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
instead is you know somebody comes in
 
01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
says it's 1200 sorry it's the mark and
 
01:59:37.729 --> 01:59:37.739 align:start position:0%
then the next person does 13 and the
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
next person does 14 and it kind of goes
 
01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:42.060 align:start position:0%
like that and what I was referring to as
 
01:59:45.050 --> 01:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
effective price fixing not actual behind
 
01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
closed doors price fixing
 
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
um but if for to use the exaggerated
 
01:59:50.689 --> 01:59:50.699 align:start position:0%
example if you see that it's not lining
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
up that the rinse is not lining up in
 
01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
that particular owner has a pattern of
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
doing that then you can start to
 
01:59:59.089 --> 01:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
identify you know why is that person
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
doing that is there a reason
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
um but you have kind of you know so the
 
02:00:05.689 --> 02:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
answer is this inherently you're asking
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
what how will it help people the only
 
02:00:10.129 --> 02:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
thing this does is information it
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any additional thing other
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
than providing information that may then
 
02:00:20.089 --> 02:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
right go ahead thank you one more
 
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative Reed so in in that vein
 
02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:30.199 align:start position:0%
the public information
 
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
acquired from the registry of deeds when
 
02:00:35.390 --> 02:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
the property is sold lists the price
 
02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:37.139 align:start position:0%
because you can figure it out from the
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
tax stamps it doesn't list a specific
 
02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:40.669 align:start position:0%
tax stamps it doesn't list a specific
price

02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
price
 
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
so that's how the assessor figures it
 
02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.149 align:start position:0%
so that's how the assessor figures it
out

02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:46.139 align:start position:0%
so would you consider this an invasion
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
of the privacy of the landlord to make
 
02:00:51.709 --> 02:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
them tell what they're charging for rent
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
each year no because like I said a
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
housing being the most important and
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
most expensive cost almost everyone has
 
02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
B no other product is like that why is
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
housing the only secretive product if I
 
02:01:07.490 --> 02:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to buy a dozen eggs we all know
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
how much that dozen eggs is if I want to
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
buy gas I know exactly how much these
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
prices are emblazoned so why is it that
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
rent the most important cost is the only
 
02:01:18.890 --> 02:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
secretive thing that we have that we can
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
buy as consumers thank you for your
 
02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:24.679 align:start position:0%
answer representative thank you Mr chair
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you Mr
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
taking another question
 
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
um do you foresee that the community
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
that a community should also have to
 
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
send in or register with the or send in
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
what their increase their maximum
 
02:01:45.770 --> 02:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
increase should be to the registry of D
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
so there's some type of reconciliation
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
I guess I didn't quite follow are you
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
saying when they increase the rent that
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
at that time they need to file that as
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
well that's because I thought that's
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
what was in my bill
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
that it's a yearly and when they
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
did that answer I don't know ma'am Mr
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
chair what you may thank you I I only
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
foresee for instances if if my town were
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
to say the maximum increase is three
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
percent and the landlord sends into the
 
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
registry two percent should there be
 
02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
some reconciliation that the landlord is
 
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
actually uh is actually doing better
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
than what the standards allow oh you're
 
02:02:31.609 --> 02:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
talking about if the previous Bill were
 
02:02:33.790 --> 02:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
to also pass in conjunction with this
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was I was completely within
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
this one bill
 
02:02:40.970 --> 02:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
um so I mean yeah you should always
 
02:02:43.970 --> 02:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
reward good behavior and so this data
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
could in to your example could be used
 
02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
to highlight landlords that use good
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
practices as much as it could be used to
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative L Word
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
02:03:06.169 --> 02:03:06.179 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at
 
02:03:06.179 --> 02:03:07.850 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at
um

02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 540 colon 1-A definitions under
 
02:03:15.410 --> 02:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
actions against tenants and there's all
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
types of different types of properties
 
02:03:21.850 --> 02:03:21.860 align:start position:0%
some are excluded from uh some are
 
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
non-restricted properties restricted
 
02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:25.930 align:start position:0%
non-restricted properties restricted
properties

02:03:25.930 --> 02:03:25.940 align:start position:0%
properties
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not the term tenant or
 
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
tenancy shall include occupancy it goes
 
02:03:32.810 --> 02:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
on and on
 
02:03:37.370 --> 02:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
how this can be a public concern and
 
02:03:43.129 --> 02:03:43.139 align:start position:0%
like unless each and every type of
 
02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
tenancy can be recorded in association
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
with a
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
an amount of rent you know vacation
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
homes versus or vacation property versus
 
02:03:54.599 --> 02:03:55.669 align:start position:0%
homes versus or vacation property versus
uh

02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
and and so can you clarify how it is
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
that this property owned here is being
 
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
rented for a vacation property for three
 
02:04:07.370 --> 02:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a week
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
and the annual rents for however long
 
02:04:13.129 --> 02:04:13.139 align:start position:0%
okay so how is that supposed to be
 
02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
helpful to the public
 
02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's a completely valid piece
 
02:04:21.649 --> 02:04:21.659 align:start position:0%
of information that if you live on
 
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach for example and it's
 
02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
summer or rather if you own property on
 
02:04:27.290 --> 02:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach and it's summer then
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to go for more but that's
 
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know kind of across the board if
 
02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
you're asking can counties include
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
certain areas as fake or certain areas
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
or even certain time periods or certain
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
qualifications like is this a short-term
 
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
rental for example as data that they
 
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
collect to kind of weigh that
 
02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
information that they're collecting
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly valid again I'm not
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
restricting any of the data they collect
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
thank you represent representative
 
02:04:53.159 --> 02:04:54.229 align:start position:0%
thank you represent representative
Cahill

02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
Cahill
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
do you think that employers could use
 
02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
this data point as a way to say limit
 
02:05:06.050 --> 02:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
raises if they know how much their
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
employees are are renting they know they
 
02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
know the bottom line of what they can
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
afford and what they can't afford
 
02:05:12.119 --> 02:05:12.950 align:start position:0%
afford and what they can't afford
um

02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
I mean sure but or is the question are
 
02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
they going to pay less than they're
 
02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
currently paying because they already
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
use every uh rationale to pay as little
 
02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
as they possibly can so on the converse
 
02:05:29.450 --> 02:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
can then the employees go to the
 
02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
employer and goes hey these are the
 
02:05:34.609 --> 02:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
rental amounts in this area I cannot
 
02:05:37.010 --> 02:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
live here and work for you for anything
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
less than x so that also is the other
 
02:05:43.729 --> 02:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
side of that coin that arms tenants
 
02:05:43.739 --> 02:05:49.550 align:start position:0%
side of that coin that arms tenants
foreign

02:05:49.550 --> 02:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:52.550 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:05:54.890 --> 02:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
um you talked about how there is not
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
currently like
 
02:05:56.639 --> 02:05:57.290 align:start position:0%
currently like
um

02:05:57.290 --> 02:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of price fixing uh
 
02:06:03.890 --> 02:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
going on with rents
 
02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:06.169 align:start position:0%
going on with rents
but

02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't the
 
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
um ability to be able to go onto the um
 
02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
go to the registry of deeds and get all
 
02:06:19.870 --> 02:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
of the prices for the entire
 
02:06:24.490 --> 02:06:24.500 align:start position:0%
city region whatever and and
 
02:06:27.050 --> 02:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
decide based on that information that
 
02:06:29.089 --> 02:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get right readily right
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
now increase the likelihood of them
 
02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:33.470 align:start position:0%
now increase the likelihood of them
being

02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.310 align:start position:0%
being
um

02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:38.300 align:start position:0%
using that information to increase rent
 
02:06:41.209 --> 02:06:41.219 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
clarify what I said earlier
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
um what I said or at least intended to
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
say was there's not to my knowledge a
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
lot of true price fixing but what is
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
happening is in effect price fixing
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
already in that this transparency is
 
02:07:01.010 --> 02:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
what will help ameliorate it because
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
right now and so the idea that so if you
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
want you want to talk about true price
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
fixing that's where two people or more
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
go behind closed doors and say we're not
 
02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
going to compete with each other I'm
 
02:07:11.330 --> 02:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
going to keep my prices up if you keep
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
your prices up and that way nobody's got
 
02:07:14.530 --> 02:07:14.540 align:start position:0%
an option
 
02:07:16.850 --> 02:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
nothing that we're currently doing is
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
preventing those people from already
 
02:07:19.729 --> 02:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
doing that and nothing in this bill
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
encourages them to do that so true price
 
02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
fixing is unaffected by this bill the in
 
02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
effect price fixing that is a huge
 
02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:30.659 align:start position:0%
problem because I don't know if true
 
02:07:32.209 --> 02:07:32.219 align:start position:0%
price fixing is a problem in terms of
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
like the actual illicit agreements
 
02:07:37.010 --> 02:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
between people but the in effect where
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
we can just I'm just going to blame
 
02:07:40.010 --> 02:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
Market but I'm actually going to raise
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
it 200 more than what Market really
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
demands but I'm going to blame market
 
02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
and then the next guy raises another 200
 
02:07:48.669 --> 02:07:48.679 align:start position:0%
over that and it goes on and on and on
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
that does get fixed by this and that is
 
02:07:53.570 --> 02:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
probably far worse a problem it
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
certainly is a real problem that we can
 
02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
point to and I don't know that the true
 
02:08:00.649 --> 02:08:00.659 align:start position:0%
price fixing is
 
02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hicks a while ago you
 
02:08:04.609 --> 02:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
raised your hand I forgot about you over
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
there sorry
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for this clarifying
 
02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.030 align:start position:0%
um thank you for this clarifying
question

02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
I apologize I apologize if I missed this
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm reading recording monthly rent
 
02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
charge at each property within the
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
county does that mean unit
 
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
or just the property
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
so my intent and I think this says it is
 
02:08:27.890 --> 02:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
is unit per unit
 
02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
because that's what you rent on a
 
02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
monthly basis you don't if you have like
 
02:08:33.169 --> 02:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
six units in a property you don't rent
 
02:08:34.609 --> 02:08:34.619 align:start position:0%
the entire property
 
02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:37.850 --> 02:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative Brown you had a question
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh quick question in
 
02:08:43.129 --> 02:08:43.139 align:start position:0%
regard to my property taxes I have the
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to block people from viewing
 
02:08:48.609 --> 02:08:48.619 align:start position:0%
what I pay for taxes on my home
 
02:08:50.689 --> 02:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
following up from what one of the other
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives said would uh rent to be
 
02:08:55.490 --> 02:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
able to block this from being viewed
 
02:08:57.530 --> 02:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
publicly because they don't want people
 
02:08:59.450 --> 02:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
to know what they're paying for right
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know that's a very interesting
 
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
question and I presume that the county
 
02:09:06.890 --> 02:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
could use the same exact method that I
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
feel so weird the same exact it's I
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
promise it's not disrespect
 
02:09:13.010 --> 02:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative the same exact method
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
that they currently have to get that
 
02:09:16.250 --> 02:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
information from a runner as they do
 
02:09:17.810 --> 02:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
from a homeowner to block certain
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
information thank you
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
representative to 11. thank you again Mr
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks again representative
 
02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:26.149 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks again representative
Reed

02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
Reed
 
02:09:26.159 --> 02:09:26.990 align:start position:0%
Reed
um

02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
are you I am not aware that
 
02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:34.619 align:start position:0%
what you pay for taxes in a specific
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
town or community
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
is able to be blocked as the
 
02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
representatives are you aware of that I
 
02:09:43.129 --> 02:09:43.139 align:start position:0%
was not aware I just presumed it was a
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
my own ignorance
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
um but if if it is the case then it
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
should it can be extended I presume if
 
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's not the case then I wouldn't
 
02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
recommend creating anything new
 
02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
certainly this bill doesn't do that
 
02:09:57.709 --> 02:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
thanks follow up Mr chair
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
sure I hear you
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
um as far as I know
 
02:10:06.169 --> 02:10:06.179 align:start position:0%
you cannot block the public from finding
 
02:10:08.689 --> 02:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
out what you pay for taxes in your
 
02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
municipality at this point in time just
 
02:10:16.070 --> 02:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
no it's not a question Mr chair please
 
02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
forgive me the edification is still
 
02:10:23.330 --> 02:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
appreciated one other I'll repeat uh for
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
the for our committee members we are
 
02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
here to get clarifications on what the
 
02:10:31.250 --> 02:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
individual given testimony is spoken to
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
and we can make our comments when we
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
exec the bills
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have a series of very very
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
quick ones for you it's a simple answers
 
02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:44.450 align:start position:0%
quick ones for you it's a simple answers
please

02:10:44.450 --> 02:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
um could you tell me how many landlords
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
there are in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
I do not have that number thank you
 
02:10:53.149 --> 02:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
um when the rents are recorded
 
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
um how are you going to ensure their
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
accuracy and who will verify the
 
02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:57.830 align:start position:0%
accuracy and who will verify the
accuracy

02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
accuracy
 
02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
I don't I did not provide a method of
 
02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
doing that in the bill it's the honor
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
System sure and uh the last one several
 
02:11:08.689 --> 02:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
references or answers to questions
 
02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:11.099 align:start position:0%
talked about the county gets to choose
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
how they do this or what they collect
 
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
where's that in the language I don't
 
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
believe it is required to be in the
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
language because this is just mandating
 
02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
that they do the bare minimum but on an
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
administrative level they can collect
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
they do frequently collect a whole bunch
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
of information okay thank you very much
 
02:11:31.129 --> 02:11:31.139 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing none thank
 
02:11:33.169 --> 02:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony we're going to
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%
Institute the three-minute rule again
 
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
because we are extremely behind
 
02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:40.669 align:start position:0%
because we are extremely behind
um

02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
well let's see we have we have about
 
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
four or five we'll we'll make it four
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
and please if the if the points have
 
02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
been made try to not repeat them let's
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
start with Kathy Stacy
 
02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:53.330 align:start position:0%
start with Kathy Stacy
um

02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:11.330 --> 02:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Kathy Stacy I
 
02:12:16.250 --> 02:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
am the Rockingham County register of
 
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
deeds and the legislative chief of the
 
02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of counties
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
I'm testify I'm testifying excuse me
 
02:12:26.570 --> 02:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to this bill
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
um primarily a lot of information I'm
 
02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
listening to testimony I'm kind of
 
02:12:33.649 --> 02:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
surprised at how much responsibility is
 
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
put over to the counties that really
 
02:12:39.169 --> 02:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong with the counties this
 
02:12:39.179 --> 02:12:40.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong with the counties this
bill

02:12:40.070 --> 02:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:12:43.629 --> 02:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
is requiring what what's termed a
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
registry of rents
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
which means my office would have to set
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
up a whole new system
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
to document this information because it
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
would have to be separate from the
 
02:12:58.669 --> 02:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
current indexing system that we have in
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
there and and just rest assured the
 
02:13:04.189 --> 02:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
information that we collect very
 
02:13:06.109 --> 02:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
specific when we're talking about land
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
records I have the biggest installation
 
02:13:10.490 --> 02:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire my records
 
02:13:13.129 --> 02:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
date back to 1629.
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
um and everything's available online one
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the biggest things about this bill is
 
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
the cost and expense to the county and
 
02:13:23.149 --> 02:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
this actually violates 28a it's an
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate we would have to
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
implement and pay for new programming
 
02:13:30.530 --> 02:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
software Hardware you know the
 
02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
implementation of a whole setup to get
 
02:13:34.729 --> 02:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
it onto the website if it's available to
 
02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
on the web
 
02:13:39.290 --> 02:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
um and and quite honestly
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
um it it just doesn't fit in with what
 
02:13:44.689 --> 02:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
we do now I it needs to be I mean invite
 
02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
anybody to come to the local registry of
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
deeds to see what we do and how we do it
 
02:13:51.169 --> 02:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
and what's located there I don't think
 
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as people think it is and
 
02:13:56.930 --> 02:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
I can say that because I've been the
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
registrar for the last 29 years
 
02:14:02.089 --> 02:14:02.099 align:start position:0%
so you know basically the counties are
 
02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
asking to to vote this in expedient to
 
02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
legislate we don't see the need the
 
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
requirement of having
 
02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
rental information out there
 
02:14:14.330 --> 02:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
um number one but number two the the
 
02:14:16.129 --> 02:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
biggest the biggest problem is the
 
02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
violation of
 
02:14:18.119 --> 02:14:19.010 align:start position:0%
violation of
uh

02:14:19.010 --> 02:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:20.510 align:start position:0%
uh
28-day

02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
28-day
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh Guthrie I believe you
 
02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
have a hand up down there thank you
 
02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and welcome
 
02:14:34.490 --> 02:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
Kathy's always nice to see you thank you
 
02:14:38.330 --> 02:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
and I I just wanted to say do you think
 
02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
that you've in your testimony you've
 
02:14:43.370 --> 02:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
indicated what the indeterminate
 
02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
increase will be in your in your budget
 
02:14:48.169 --> 02:14:48.179 align:start position:0%
because we don't get that information on
 
02:14:49.850 --> 02:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
the bill and that's part of the problem
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
you have 10 counties that have different
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
vendors who you know that we use for our
 
02:14:55.079 --> 02:14:56.330 align:start position:0%
vendors who you know that we use for our
systems

02:14:56.330 --> 02:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and so it would it would differ from
 
02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
place to place I would have to get a
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
quote from a vendor to find out exactly
 
02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
because you're talking about uh you know
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
putting together source code and
 
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
programming and you know so that we
 
02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
determine so that actually you determine
 
02:15:13.850 --> 02:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
what is supposed to be captured it's not
 
02:15:15.290 --> 02:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
up to the county to determine what's
 
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
supposed to be captured uh you know in
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
in in the this index okay and because
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
currently we do not index by property
 
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
address we never have and we never will
 
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
we utilize map and lot or subdivision
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
information things like that but
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
everything is under the owner's name
 
02:15:35.569 --> 02:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
everything that we have in our office is
 
02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
under owner's name only that's how you
 
02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
research you cannot research any other
 
02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:41.330 align:start position:0%
research you cannot research any other
way

02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
I do want to address
 
02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
one of the comments with regards to
 
02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
masking of information at the Town
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
assessing and it absolutely is done I am
 
02:15:52.609 --> 02:15:52.619 align:start position:0%
a selectman in the town of Salem and you
 
02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
can actually go to your town assessor
 
02:15:56.930 --> 02:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
and you have to have obviously a reason
 
02:15:59.569 --> 02:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
why but they will mask your your
 
02:16:01.129 --> 02:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
information there
 
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:03.540 align:start position:0%

02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%

02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.310 --> 02:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony uh
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
again my name is Nick Norman
 
02:17:06.169 --> 02:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
I'm an advocate for landlords in the
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
landlord community
 
02:17:09.290 --> 02:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs chair for the
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
Department Association of New Hampshire
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
same introduction as I gave you last
 
02:17:12.599 --> 02:17:13.669 align:start position:0%
same introduction as I gave you last
time

02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:17:15.530 --> 02:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
we are against this bill and asked that
 
02:17:18.169 --> 02:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
you voted in expedient to legislate
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
some of the points have already been
 
02:17:23.209 --> 02:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
raised so I'll just go through Brush by
 
02:17:24.849 --> 02:17:24.859 align:start position:0%
those quickly
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
we would think that this is against
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
antitrust law because
 
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
it would
 
02:17:34.429 --> 02:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
unquestionably lead to the effect of
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
price fixing
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't you think as a landlord you'd love
 
02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
to know what Joe is getting for the rent
 
02:17:41.330 --> 02:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
here and the Joe's getting and Sally's
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
getting for the rent to the the
 
02:17:44.209 --> 02:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
neighboring property
 
02:17:47.389 --> 02:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
of course it's going to lead to
 
02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
increase rents
 
02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:50.389 align:start position:0%
increase rents
because

02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's just the way it will be fine I
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
mean it does it take much to to figure
 
02:17:57.049 --> 02:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
that out
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
um this would be a substantial expense
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
to the counties
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
it would require the raising of real
 
02:18:04.730 --> 02:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
estate taxes
 
02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
putting further in pressure on
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
increasing the rents
 
02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
we don't need the government to put
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
pressure on increasing rents we need the
 
02:18:15.530 --> 02:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
government to look at creating more
 
02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:16.849 align:start position:0%
government to look at creating more
housing

02:18:16.849 --> 02:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
again like I said before if you're not
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
looking at creating more
 
02:18:23.089 --> 02:18:23.099 align:start position:0%
housing increasing the supply you're
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
looking in the wrong place
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
we do think that this would be an
 
02:18:30.410 --> 02:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
invasion of tenants financial
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
information and landlords Private
 
02:18:34.730 --> 02:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
Financial information
 
02:18:36.650 --> 02:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't say what must be
 
02:18:39.290 --> 02:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
reported is it the total rent or
 
02:18:45.049 --> 02:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
what about
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
certain tenants that have been residents
 
02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
for 20 or longer years and they have a
 
02:18:54.889 --> 02:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
really low rent do they really want that
 
02:18:54.899 --> 02:18:56.570 align:start position:0%
really low rent do they really want that
known

02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
known
 
02:18:58.969 --> 02:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't there then be pressure to
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
get that tenant's rent increased
 
02:19:05.209 --> 02:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
what would it do in terms of financing a
 
02:19:06.530 --> 02:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
property with all this public
 
02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:07.849 align:start position:0%
property with all this public
information

02:19:07.849 --> 02:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
and qualifications on financing would a
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
bank then want to step in and force the
 
02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
landlord to do something about those low
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
rents because we see your debt income
 
02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
ratio is too low we think you should
 
02:19:25.370 --> 02:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
what about the fact that there's nothing
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
in the bill that says what kind of
 
02:19:32.450 --> 02:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
property this would uncover
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
residential property commercial property
 
02:19:37.370 --> 02:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
any rent
 
02:19:41.889 --> 02:19:41.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
Church rental properties
 
02:19:49.250 --> 02:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:51.170 align:start position:0%
 
additionally

02:19:51.170 --> 02:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
02:19:55.250 --> 02:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
rents are very varied right some rents
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
include heat and hot water some include
 
02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
heat some include only hot water some
 
02:20:03.230 --> 02:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
include Water and Sewer some don't
 
02:20:05.450 --> 02:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
what is the meaning of a piece of data
 
02:20:07.969 --> 02:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
if you don't have all the rest of that
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
on a commercial lease it's really common
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
to have triple net leases where the
 
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
tenant the commercial tenant pays for
 
02:20:17.570 --> 02:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
the property taxes or the insurance or
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
the water and sewer without that
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
information collected it's fairly
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
meaningless to look at just rent
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
so we just don't see any usefulness in
 
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
this and certainly it's a tremendous
 
02:20:34.490 --> 02:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
amount of administration there's a
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
boatload of rentals in New Hampshire
 
02:20:40.429 --> 02:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about something small
 
02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of rentals in New
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially if you're now
 
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
including all commercial school
 
02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:47.690 align:start position:0%
including all commercial school
districts

02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:20:51.050 --> 02:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
vacant land anything that's rent so I
 
02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to ask questions and
 
02:20:55.370 --> 02:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you to vote in expedient
 
02:20:58.130 --> 02:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
to legislate my contact info is on here
 
02:21:00.650 --> 02:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
again please switch out to me
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for your testimony
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
I see no questions appreciate it
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.929 --> 02:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
hello and now I get to say good
 
02:21:20.939 --> 02:21:22.190 align:start position:0%
hello and now I get to say good
afternoon

02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
um again Jessica marjison with Granite
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
State organizing project I'm here on
 
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
myself though
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
um but it shows my background as a
 
02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
tenant organizer for 15 years the tenant
 
02:21:35.090 --> 02:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
association and working on the
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester housing commission this bill
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
would be so hugely helpful to me as I
 
02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
accidentally spoke up during the last
 
02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:43.010 align:start position:0%
accidentally spoke up during the last
bill

02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:43.790 align:start position:0%
bill
um

02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:46.969 --> 02:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
in our meetings I have asked what do we
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
have for stock I cannot look at my town
 
02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
stock of rentals available and see where
 
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
our shortages lie I cannot see that
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
when there's an ad for an apartment that
 
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
price is listed online there's no
 
02:22:03.849 --> 02:22:03.859 align:start position:0%
secrecy of it there's no privacy needed
 
02:22:06.530 --> 02:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I like to think about employees
 
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
employees are allowed to talk about our
 
02:22:10.610 --> 02:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
hourly pay and why is that that is so
 
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
that the employee next to us is treated
 
02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
the same as we are that is so there's
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
transparency and we're able to ask for
 
02:22:21.770 --> 02:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
the same as the other employee has this
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
would give something similar to that if
 
02:22:26.210 --> 02:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to charge us in our
 
02:22:28.849 --> 02:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
state I don't understand why it could
 
02:22:30.770 --> 02:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
not be added to a registry and I wanted
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
to mention 540
 
02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh colon 1-b that is registry of D um
 
02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
let me pull that up real quick so I can
 
02:22:41.210 --> 02:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
pronounce it correctly
 
02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
541b effective January 1st owners of
 
02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
restricted property must file a
 
02:22:51.770 --> 02:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
statement with the town or city clerk of
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
the municipality in which the property
 
02:22:55.849 --> 02:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
is located that provides the name
 
02:22:57.530 --> 02:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
address telephone number of a person
 
02:22:59.210 --> 02:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
within the state who is authorized to
 
02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
accept service or process legal
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
proceedings this would be a perfect
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
State Statute to add that under
 
02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
it also speaks on restricted property
 
02:23:13.250 --> 02:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
the properties mentioned like shared
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
living situations or rental property
 
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
that falls under 540b normally as far as
 
02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of not 540A which this statute
 
02:23:26.090 --> 02:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
we could add this to
 
02:23:29.330 --> 02:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
um we are face um so Manchester someone
 
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
did ask that question we put together a
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
quick reference housing guide in our
 
02:23:36.110 --> 02:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
city that we're just now releasing and
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
so someone asked how many rental units
 
02:23:39.650 --> 02:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
there were in Manchester
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
um there's roughly around 52 000.
 
02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:43.370 align:start position:0%
um there's roughly around 52 000.
um

02:23:43.370 --> 02:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
right now the estimated number of units
 
02:23:49.210 --> 02:23:49.220 align:start position:0%
the number of units approved in progress
 
02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
1439 number of approved units offered
 
02:23:56.270 --> 02:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
below fair market rate 210. I can't find
 
02:23:59.330 --> 02:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
the number I need as I spoke about Noah
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
the naturally occurring affordable
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
housing that has been decimated across
 
02:24:05.389 --> 02:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
many towns
 
02:24:07.969 --> 02:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
with predatory landlords there's a a
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
thing they like to go after class C type
 
02:24:11.570 --> 02:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
buildings these are dilapidated type
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
buildings these properties normally rent
 
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
for Less allowing someone who has not
 
02:24:16.849 --> 02:24:16.859 align:start position:0%
been able to get a housing Choice
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
voucher to somehow survive until they
 
02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
can get to that point these properties
 
02:24:23.450 --> 02:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
are important because our state and our
 
02:24:25.010 --> 02:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
federal government cannot produce enough
 
02:24:26.690 --> 02:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
housing Choice vouchers to actually
 
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
house those on disability all of them
 
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
and those at below 30 Ami and when
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 30 Ami
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
um you're talking income for one
 
02:24:39.050 --> 02:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
person's twenty one thousand that rent
 
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
looks like 525 a month I'm trying to
 
02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
find the stock of those apartments
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
available for those people that I need
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
to fill that need and I can't find it
 
02:24:50.030 --> 02:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
this would be hugely helpful and if we
 
02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
can't show everybody this would be
 
02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
helpful for commissions and those work
 
02:24:56.330 --> 02:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
in the city our zoning boards our
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
planning boards when we need to go and
 
02:25:00.349 --> 02:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
look at that to see what the need is for
 
02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
offering incentives like 79e great tax
 
02:25:06.290 --> 02:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
incentive for affordable housing
 
02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:07.010 align:start position:0%
incentive for affordable housing
um

02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:08.929 --> 02:25:08.939 align:start position:0%
what is it um
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay you're gonna have to wrap it up yes
 
02:25:13.849 --> 02:25:13.859 align:start position:0%
gun and questionnaire zoning hugely
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
helpful for that when incentives are on
 
02:25:17.809 --> 02:25:17.819 align:start position:0%
the line
 
02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
and I'll try and wrap it up there
 
02:25:21.050 --> 02:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to make it take too
 
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
much longer thank you thank you are
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have two very very quick
 
02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:28.130 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have two very very quick
ones

02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
ones
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned employees can talk to
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
each other regarding pay is there
 
02:25:34.250 --> 02:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
anything in the states uh like a pay
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
registry where employers have to report
 
02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:38.150 align:start position:0%
registry where employers have to report
their

02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
what they're paying their employees no
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
I've never done um the closest I get to
 
02:25:45.610 --> 02:25:45.620 align:start position:0%
employment advocacy is
 
02:25:47.809 --> 02:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
advocating for the minimum wage to get
 
02:25:49.250 --> 02:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
raised so we can afford our rent so
 
02:25:51.050 --> 02:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
there's no pay registry no not that I
 
02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
know of and again you said that they can
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
talk to each other regarding pay to know
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
how much they're each getting so they
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
can maybe get their raise can renters
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
talk to each other about what they're
 
02:26:02.090 --> 02:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
paying they can and that's why we
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be worried about the privacy
 
02:26:05.870 --> 02:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
of this and that's what I get told when
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
I asked our assessor's office can I get
 
02:26:09.770 --> 02:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
a report of what rents we have in our
 
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
city to know what we're missing because
 
02:26:13.610 --> 02:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
I'm always saying these units are
 
02:26:16.610 --> 02:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
missing how can I show this this is some
 
02:26:18.650 --> 02:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
way I can show this
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
maybe I wasn't clearing the question I'm
 
02:26:23.690 --> 02:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
sorry that the question you made the
 
02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
comment that
 
02:26:28.370 --> 02:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
If the vice chair and I are
 
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
talking each to each other about what we
 
02:26:32.690 --> 02:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
make so we can talk to our employees and
 
02:26:35.210 --> 02:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
say hey we we might need more can't two
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
renters do the same without creating a
 
02:26:37.319 --> 02:26:38.510 align:start position:0%
renters do the same without creating a
registry

02:26:38.510 --> 02:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
registry
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
they can but it that's not the main
 
02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
focus of it one way it could help as
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
Norman stated when they have a good
 
02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
renter they charge a lower amount but
 
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
when they have a bad renter they charge
 
02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
a higher amount
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
um those are what they call a good
 
02:26:53.690 --> 02:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
renter or a bad renter is up to their
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
definition but it would let that
 
02:26:58.429 --> 02:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
neighbor know hey my neighbors pay in
 
02:27:00.170 --> 02:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
half the amount because there is a state
 
02:27:02.450 --> 02:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
statute along those lines like if you if
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
your landlord tries to evict you out of
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
your apartment because he wants to move
 
02:27:07.610 --> 02:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
in there they're going to look at does
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
he have any other available units that
 
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
are comparable
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
if your rent was increased to this much
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
or the other comparable units the same
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
those things are looked at
 
02:27:20.210 --> 02:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much next we
 
02:27:27.770 --> 02:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
I will do my best to stay within the
 
02:27:35.330 --> 02:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
four minutes my name is David Klein I'm
 
02:27:38.090 --> 02:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
a small landlord I have 40 units and
 
02:27:39.950 --> 02:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
spread out between Dover Rochester and
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
Somersworth I am opposed to HP 422 for a
 
02:27:46.849 --> 02:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
number of reasons first of all I believe
 
02:27:49.250 --> 02:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I contend that the New Hampshire
 
02:27:52.130 --> 02:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
right to privacy as state in article 2B
 
02:27:53.809 --> 02:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
of the first part of the New Hampshire
 
02:27:56.170 --> 02:27:56.180 align:start position:0%
Constitution makes this bill
 
02:27:59.450 --> 02:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional unconstitutional it
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
states that an individual has a right to
 
02:28:04.010 --> 02:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
live free from government intrusion in
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
private or personal information is
 
02:28:10.610 --> 02:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
natural is essential and inherent my
 
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
gross rental information I think is
 
02:28:16.969 --> 02:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
where I don't voluntarily disclose it uh
 
02:28:19.849 --> 02:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
definitely personal com information
 
02:28:22.429 --> 02:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
and I also think that major developers
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about shopping center
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
developers big office building
 
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
developers because they're caught by the
 
02:28:28.849 --> 02:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
language of the spill it doesn't say
 
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
residential it says all renters also
 
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
that's confidential information to the
 
02:28:35.809 --> 02:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
extent they make people who might be
 
02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
buying or whatever sign non-com
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements
 
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
um second of all this bill has the
 
02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
potential hurting tenants and Nick
 
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
Norman touched on it very quickly I have
 
02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
a tenant that I've had 10 10 to 12 years
 
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
now she's on Social Security walks with
 
02:28:54.170 --> 02:28:54.180 align:start position:0%
a cane has no source of income well
 
02:28:55.849 --> 02:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
except for the Social Security I'm
 
02:28:57.889 --> 02:28:57.899 align:start position:0%
charging her 950 a month we've been very
 
02:28:59.570 --> 02:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
light in their increases that apartment
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
can go probably for 1400 a month if
 
02:29:04.130 --> 02:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
every tenant in the building knows it
 
02:29:05.929 --> 02:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
I'm under charging her they're going to
 
02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
be on my case about why aren't you under
 
02:29:10.849 --> 02:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
charging me and you're exposing her to
 
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
harassment from the other tenants never
 
02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
mind what's going to come our way is the
 
02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:15.889 align:start position:0%
mind what's going to come our way is the
landlord

02:29:15.889 --> 02:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
02:29:17.809 --> 02:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I have to push up a rent
 
02:29:19.490 --> 02:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
and what's going to happen if a children
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't who are helping her don't pay it
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
she's going to have to move
 
02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
and that's not what we're all about we
 
02:29:27.309 --> 02:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
want to be able to have that flexibility
 
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
and part of the problems with this this
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill is it can't build a database that
 
02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
really reflects the differences in the
 
02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:37.070 align:start position:0%
really reflects the differences in the
apartments

02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
I have the building that that this 950 a
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
month tenant lives in the second floor
 
02:29:44.510 --> 02:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
Apartments do not have washer dryer
 
02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
hookups even though the foil plan is
 
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
almost the same
 
02:29:49.730 --> 02:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
we charge less for those you're walking
 
02:29:51.410 --> 02:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
up a flight of stairs you don't have the
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
washer drying hookups we pay for heat
 
02:29:55.130 --> 02:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
and hot water there's a big reason why
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
they're less money I can't put that in a
 
02:29:59.870 --> 02:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
database or that's going to be a hell of
 
02:30:02.929 --> 02:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
a problem for someone like Kathy Stacy
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I also agree with her that this
 
02:30:07.610 --> 02:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
building is an unfunded minute mandate
 
02:30:10.969 --> 02:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
and completely goes against article 28a
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
at the first part of our constitution
 
02:30:14.929 --> 02:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
also this bill should be defeated here
 
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional it's not going to
 
02:30:19.849 --> 02:30:19.859 align:start position:0%
produce any Real Results that that the
 
02:30:21.650 --> 02:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
advocacy of the bill are producing it's
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
just going to cause more confusion and
 
02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
more problem for long-term good tenants
 
02:30:29.570 --> 02:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
who have been undercharged because of
 
02:30:31.969 --> 02:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
Lynn was like me who will hold down the
 
02:30:33.410 --> 02:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
rent for the existing tenants who have
 
02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
been very good and are long term
 
02:30:38.270 --> 02:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
to speak against this bill
 
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:30:46.010 --> 02:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
about the uh point about privacy
 
02:30:52.439 --> 02:30:53.270 align:start position:0%
about the uh point about privacy
um

02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
so presumably it's already the case that
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
the person who is paying the rent
 
02:31:02.210 --> 02:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
already knows that figure too right so
 
02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
how can it be private information if the
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
person who's paying it already knows it
 
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
it is private they're not they're not
 
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
obligated to disclose it to anyone
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
just as much as it you know I mean I
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
would say this 950 tenant doesn't tell
 
02:31:17.389 --> 02:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
anyone because she doesn't want the
 
02:31:19.309 --> 02:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
other tennis knowing that she's paying a
 
02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
whole lot less you put it in a registry
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
and let me say another one is
 
02:31:31.010 --> 02:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
I would say that a company like Shaw's
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're not going to want what they're
 
02:31:34.730 --> 02:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
paying per square foot or for a
 
02:31:39.170 --> 02:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:41.630 --> 02:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:44.389 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:31:44.399 --> 02:31:46.610 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:31:46.610 --> 02:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:49.250 --> 02:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
if someone has
 
02:31:52.190 --> 02:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
um uh let's say live-in partner or
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
something that is as a personal
 
02:31:56.690 --> 02:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
agreement to that they will be
 
02:31:58.849 --> 02:31:58.859 align:start position:0%
contributing a certain number of amount
 
02:32:01.849 --> 02:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
per rent or if they try to do a sublet
 
02:32:04.730 --> 02:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
or something like that would though
 
02:32:07.309 --> 02:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
um to you know a friend for you know a
 
02:32:10.610 --> 02:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
month or whatever to stay in one of
 
02:32:12.770 --> 02:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
their rooms in their apartment or
 
02:32:13.969 --> 02:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
whatever like they have a two-bedroom
 
02:32:15.650 --> 02:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
apartment or something
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
would that
 
02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:18.590 align:start position:0%
would that
um

02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
now make the renter have to disclose
 
02:32:21.359 --> 02:32:22.490 align:start position:0%
now make the renter have to disclose
that

02:32:22.490 --> 02:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:23.030 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:25.610 --> 02:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
in your understanding of this and and
 
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
maybe you know a live-in partner would
 
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
also now that wouldn't be known to
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
anyone what the the
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
um like the contractual agreement
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
between you know a really person having
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
a relationship would now fall under this
 
02:32:43.730 --> 02:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
um requirement to notify the registry of
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
deeds are you seeing that that might be
 
02:32:49.010 --> 02:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
a invasion of the privacy of those
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
people the answer is yes to your second
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
question I think it is an innovation of
 
02:32:55.730 --> 02:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
privacy second of all if you look at the
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
language of the bill is very broad all
 
02:32:58.319 --> 02:32:59.389 align:start position:0%
language of the bill is very broad all
renters

02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
renters
 
02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
about people who lease have to report so
 
02:33:03.889 --> 02:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
if the subleasing technically I would
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
say yes they fall under it that's a
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
practical matter who's going to know
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:33:16.429 --> 02:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
so you know more questions next we have
 
02:33:28.250 --> 02:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for recognizing my
 
02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:32.870 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for recognizing my
name

02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
name
 
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
um I'm still gonna let's deliver one top
 
02:33:36.530 --> 02:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
Auburn Street in Manchester New
 
02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:37.309 align:start position:0%
Auburn Street in Manchester New
Hampshire

02:33:37.309 --> 02:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:33:39.650 --> 02:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
you know we can't have it both ways I
 
02:33:41.150 --> 02:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
suspect this bill will come back again
 
02:33:43.790 --> 02:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
until it's something comes fast I I
 
02:33:45.770 --> 02:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
regret that it does not say residential
 
02:33:48.410 --> 02:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
because I I would think that that's what
 
02:33:50.030 --> 02:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
they meant that's where the problem is
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
right now uh let me tell you an example
 
02:33:55.849 --> 02:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
ten years ago in Manchester it was not
 
02:33:55.859 --> 02:33:58.130 align:start position:0%
ten years ago in Manchester it was not
illegal

02:33:58.130 --> 02:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
for you to have a one or a two bedroom
 
02:34:03.050 --> 02:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
apartment and have three families living
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
in there because people couldn't afford
 
02:34:06.590 --> 02:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
to pay the rent
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
but it became a fire hazard
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
like a hall you could only put in so
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
many people
 
02:34:15.889 --> 02:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
and so the laws got changed for the
 
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
safety of the people
 
02:34:20.210 --> 02:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
this is the same thing
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
do you know how many couches are being
 
02:34:22.319 --> 02:34:23.330 align:start position:0%
do you know how many couches are being
used

02:34:23.330 --> 02:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:34:25.730 --> 02:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
for people who don't have rent
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
and most of your leases at least my
 
02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
lease says that if I have a visitor they
 
02:34:33.170 --> 02:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
could only spend 45 days at a time there
 
02:34:36.290 --> 02:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
then they have to leave
 
02:34:38.990 --> 02:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that's a federal rent so if it's on
 
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
the federal docket it should be on the
 
02:34:44.929 --> 02:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
state as well or the county or the city
 
02:34:48.410 --> 02:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
the problem is if you don't build more
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
housing and all you or all you build are
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
expensive housing not affordable housing
 
02:34:55.730 --> 02:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
you're going to have more problems in
 
02:34:57.050 --> 02:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
the state the county and the towns
 
02:34:59.030 --> 02:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
because someone has to pay for the
 
02:35:00.770 --> 02:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
people who can't afford those rents
 
02:35:02.090 --> 02:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
they're outside
 
02:35:05.150 --> 02:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're creating a not only a nuisance
 
02:35:08.030 --> 02:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
but they're trying to survive they're in
 
02:35:10.849 --> 02:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
creating more drugs more mental anguish
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it's the cities and towns that have
 
02:35:15.050 --> 02:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
to pay for that extra cost
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
to maintain safety and people are dying
 
02:35:21.530 --> 02:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
and it's cold so we have to do something
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
about the problems now and if we don't
 
02:35:26.270 --> 02:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
start somewhere I'm hoping that maybe
 
02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment there can be an amendment
 
02:35:30.889 --> 02:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
made to this bill or normally at the end
 
02:35:32.809 --> 02:35:32.819 align:start position:0%
of the sessions I know that the house in
 
02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
Senate Conjuring
 
02:35:38.389 --> 02:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
and decide what can be added or taken
 
02:35:41.090 --> 02:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
away this is important it's a life
 
02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:42.050 align:start position:0%
away this is important it's a life
matter

02:35:42.050 --> 02:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:35:43.730 --> 02:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
it's a life man when you have people
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
dying in the streets
 
02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
you have so many families that live in
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
cars do you know that in New Hampshire
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
if you're over six years old
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
you cannot have a daughter and a son in
 
02:35:56.929 --> 02:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
the same room
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
but if you only have one bedroom what do
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
you do
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
so let's be careful let's talk about the
 
02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
problems that exist and why these bills
 
02:36:08.090 --> 02:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
are coming up somehow to resolve the
 
02:36:09.950 --> 02:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
problems if they can't do it now you'll
 
02:36:12.650 --> 02:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
have to do it down the road don't try to
 
02:36:14.690 --> 02:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
do more harm than good thank you any
 
02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:17.389 align:start position:0%
do more harm than good thank you any
questions

02:36:17.389 --> 02:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions we will thank you
 
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and call our last
 
02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
witness if anybody else there out there
 
02:36:27.410 --> 02:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
has intended to speak make sure we have
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Kathy Holmes against this bill
 
02:36:43.730 --> 02:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
I'm tempted to say I don't need to say
 
02:36:46.190 --> 02:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
anything because I believe you all are
 
02:36:48.650 --> 02:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
the majority vast majority smart enough
 
02:36:52.730 --> 02:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
to know this bill is dead but just
 
02:36:56.210 --> 02:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
um I I go ahead and say that it seems
 
02:36:58.270 --> 02:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
benign collecting information
 
02:37:01.370 --> 02:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
but it leads to further steps of
 
02:37:04.969 --> 02:37:04.979 align:start position:0%
controls and these costs I think Stacy
 
02:37:07.969 --> 02:37:07.979 align:start position:0%
that the uh Register of Deeds person
 
02:37:10.910 --> 02:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
kind of put the nail in the coffin on
 
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
this uh has so many holes uh so and the
 
02:37:17.809 --> 02:37:17.819 align:start position:0%
term predatory landlord has been thrown
 
02:37:20.270 --> 02:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
out so much I really need to defend that
 
02:37:22.929 --> 02:37:22.939 align:start position:0%
let's let's throw out the term deadbeats
 
02:37:26.389 --> 02:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
there are they landlords have to deal
 
02:37:28.969 --> 02:37:28.979 align:start position:0%
with deadbeats uh
 
02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
for my husband and I our cars are and 94
 
02:37:37.130 --> 02:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
a 2005 and our tenants always have newer
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
cars than us it's choices that they make
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
and every January we don't get the rent
 
02:37:45.170 --> 02:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
because their kids had to have a blowout
 
02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
Christmas in December it's choices
 
02:37:54.110 --> 02:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:57.050 --> 02:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I see no
 
02:37:59.450 --> 02:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
more pink cards so we'll close the
 
02:38:03.550 --> 02:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.490 --> 02:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh going back for the blue sheets
 
02:38:10.969 --> 02:38:10.979 align:start position:0%
on hb95
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
no I understand I'm going back because I
 
02:38:19.610 --> 02:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
didn't do it on the first one uh HP 95
 
02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:20.330 align:start position:0%
didn't do it on the first one uh HP 95
um

02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:24.349 --> 02:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
we had 11 people sign in five were Pro
 
02:38:27.650 --> 02:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
and six were against
 
02:38:30.830 --> 02:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
on 422
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
we had one two three four
 
02:38:37.730 --> 02:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
seven individuals sign up two were Pro
 
02:38:41.809 --> 02:38:41.819 align:start position:0%

02:38:44.929 --> 02:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
put Pro or Con on the sheet to register
 
02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
their opinion
 
02:38:50.090 --> 02:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
so there you go one more quick question
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah on online sign up there's also
 
02:38:57.950 --> 02:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
online uh
 
02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
opposer support so very good yeah thank
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
you if we can consolidate okay
 
02:39:06.349 --> 02:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
um just for planning purposes we're
 
02:39:08.270 --> 02:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to try uh we are way behind
 
02:39:10.849 --> 02:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
normally we would break at 12 30 to 1 30
 
02:39:12.650 --> 02:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
for lunch we're going to continue right
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
now I promise we will break to give
 
02:39:16.730 --> 02:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
everybody at least a few minutes to grab
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
something to eat so we're gonna go right
 
02:39:20.570 --> 02:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
into our next uh
 
02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
bill which is House Bill 98fn relative
 
02:39:26.929 --> 02:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
to applications for the low and moderate
 
02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
income homeowners property tax relief
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
program and I rep representative
 
02:39:32.640 --> 02:40:02.630 align:start position:0%
program and I rep representative
Melbourne

02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:05.809 --> 02:40:05.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and committee members
 
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Charles Melvin senior I'm a
 
02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative and I'm proposing
 
02:40:15.889 --> 02:40:15.899 align:start position:0%
legislation to amend RSA 198 send me
 
02:40:22.429 --> 02:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
colon 57 6 to change May 1st to February
 
02:40:24.770 --> 02:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
1st this change would allow the
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners to file for low and moderate
 
02:40:29.570 --> 02:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
income homeowners property tax relief at
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
the same time that they prepare their
 
02:40:33.650 --> 02:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
federal income tax returns I believe
 
02:40:35.330 --> 02:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
that the state can accommodate this
 
02:40:37.130 --> 02:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
change because the relief is based on
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
part of the most current local
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
Equalization ratio as determined by the
 
02:40:44.090 --> 02:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration and
 
02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
by the education tax rate as shown on
 
02:40:49.550 --> 02:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
the tax bill these numbers should be
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
available before the final tax bills in
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
December this change would make it much
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
easier for eligible homeowners to apply
 
02:40:59.570 --> 02:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
homeowners who have their federal income
 
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
tax prepared for them they could have
 
02:41:05.650 --> 02:41:05.660 align:start position:0%
the preparer prepare the
 
02:41:08.929 --> 02:41:08.939 align:start position:0%
dp-8 forms the application is eight
 
02:41:11.570 --> 02:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
pages and can be in intimidated to
 
02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
people who are not used to filling out
 
02:41:15.530 --> 02:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
government forms many eligible
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
homeowners probably need some assistance
 
02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
in preparing this form currently the
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
forms are not available until the filing
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
deadline from the federal income tax I
 
02:41:26.929 --> 02:41:26.939 align:start position:0%
became aware of this from one of my
 
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
constituents and am I uh
 
02:41:32.889 --> 02:41:32.899 align:start position:0%
this program offers free income tax
 
02:41:35.450 --> 02:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
preparation for the elderly and low and
 
02:41:37.849 --> 02:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
moderate income taxpayers this change
 
02:41:40.010 --> 02:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
would make it easier for lower moderate
 
02:41:42.590 --> 02:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
income holders to get some relief that
 
02:41:44.450 --> 02:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
is greatly needed
 
02:41:47.090 --> 02:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
I expect this change would result in
 
02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
more eligible homeowners applying for
 
02:41:52.309 --> 02:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
this relief I've a cop I have a copy of
 
02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
the RSA and the tax forms the eight
 
02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:56.349 align:start position:0%
the RSA and the tax forms the eight
pages

02:41:56.349 --> 02:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
pages
 
02:41:56.359 --> 02:41:57.889 align:start position:0%
pages
and

02:41:57.889 --> 02:41:57.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
if it's okay with the committee I would
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh one of our members I mean I have a
 
02:42:06.349 --> 02:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
person here an expert on this tax
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
preparation and I'd like to defer any
 
02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:22.490 --> 02:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh we need to make sure to see if
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's any questions for you as the
 
02:42:25.790 --> 02:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
presenter are there any questions for
 
02:42:27.290 --> 02:42:27.300 align:start position:0%

02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:34.200 align:start position:0%

02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
no harm question pretty much that it
 
02:42:57.230 --> 02:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much just makes yeah it makes it
 
02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
easier for a process to come complex to
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
begin with correct all right thank you
 
02:43:05.150 --> 02:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
02:43:07.370 --> 02:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
yokella thank you thank you for taking
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:10.130 align:start position:0%
the question
um

02:43:10.130 --> 02:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:12.889 --> 02:43:12.899 align:start position:0%
who whom did you consult with other than
 
02:43:14.210 --> 02:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
your expert
 
02:43:14.220 --> 02:43:14.830 align:start position:0%
your expert
um

02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:18.650 --> 02:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
as far as the the ramifications of this
 
02:43:22.130 --> 02:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh uh date change did you talk to dra
 
02:43:25.790 --> 02:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I did not talk to the dra okay
 
02:43:28.250 --> 02:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you but I understand that it could
 
02:43:30.170 --> 02:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
cost more
 
02:43:33.290 --> 02:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
because more people may apply for it but
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
I suspect that when the state initiated
 
02:43:40.429 --> 02:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
this uh RSA they should have had the
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions I have one
 
02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
question for you and it may be better
 
02:43:55.130 --> 02:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
for Mr Hamel but uh on the third page of
 
02:43:56.750 --> 02:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
the bill under the mythology the
 
02:43:58.730 --> 02:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
department note there
 
02:44:00.889 --> 02:44:00.899 align:start position:0%
talks about equalizing the value of
 
02:44:03.710 --> 02:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
properties by May 1st annually it may
 
02:44:06.290 --> 02:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
not be they may about not be able to
 
02:44:09.230 --> 02:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
calculate the property tax relief on
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:15.469 --> 02:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
get around that I to be honest with you
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that I think Roger could
 
02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
Mr Hamel could answer that better for
 
02:44:22.140 --> 02:44:24.349 align:start position:0%
Mr Hamel could answer that better for
you

02:44:24.349 --> 02:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:26.210 --> 02:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh
 
02:44:28.670 --> 02:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester thank you Mr
 
02:44:31.370 --> 02:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
chair you brought out a good uh Point Mr
 
02:44:34.090 --> 02:44:34.100 align:start position:0%
chair the question is
 
02:44:37.969 --> 02:44:37.979 align:start position:0%
do you know that uh tax
 
02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
or the budget is set at the county level
 
02:44:43.250 --> 02:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
which also has a part of the state I
 
02:44:47.630 --> 02:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
mean property tax uh set at the
 
02:44:51.530 --> 02:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
municipal county level so that doesn't
 
02:44:54.889 --> 02:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
happen until May or June so to
 
02:44:57.050 --> 02:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
preemptively do something at February
 
02:44:59.690 --> 02:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
1st May jeopardize
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
the outcome
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
I I would agree with you and to be
 
02:45:05.929 --> 02:45:05.939 align:start position:0%
honest with you I think that this
 
02:45:08.450 --> 02:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be initiated until
 
02:45:10.849 --> 02:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
the next year and then things could
 
02:45:17.150 --> 02:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:19.010 --> 02:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other questions thank you
 
02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:47.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:45:47.450 --> 02:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for having me I'm
 
02:45:53.170 --> 02:45:53.180 align:start position:0%
here to speak in favor of
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
hb98 and many of my comments are going
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
to reflect what just what uh
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative Melvin just said but
 
02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
I I'm Roger Hamill I live at 17 Spruce
 
02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
Lane in Newton New Hampshire
 
02:46:09.770 --> 02:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
I I I'm a volunteer in a program that
 
02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
provides free income tax preparation
 
02:46:14.450 --> 02:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
Services primarily targeted to the
 
02:46:17.389 --> 02:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
elderly and low to moderate income
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
residents but I'm not here as support
 
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
part of that program I'm just here as
 
02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:23.570 align:start position:0%
part of that program I'm just here as
myself

02:46:23.570 --> 02:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:46:27.650 --> 02:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
the proposed change to the RSA 198
 
02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
57 6A would allow homeowners to file
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
their low to moderate income homeowner
 
02:46:36.410 --> 02:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
property tax relief at the same time
 
02:46:38.809 --> 02:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
that they prepare their federal income
 
02:46:40.010 --> 02:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
tax return
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
this change would make it easier for
 
02:46:46.670 --> 02:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
eligible homeowners to apply homeowners
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
who have their federal income tax
 
02:46:52.270 --> 02:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
prepared and then could have the the
 
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
preparer prepare also prepare the low to
 
02:46:58.429 --> 02:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
moderate home property tax relief form
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
the dp8 at the same time
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
ep8 is an eight page
 
02:47:07.270 --> 02:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
form that can be very
 
02:47:10.490 --> 02:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
intimidating to people who are not used
 
02:47:12.650 --> 02:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
to filing government Farms
 
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
many eligible homeowners probably need
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
some assistance in preparing this form
 
02:47:19.870 --> 02:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
currently the form is not available
 
02:47:23.150 --> 02:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
until after the filing deadline for the
 
02:47:25.250 --> 02:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
federal income tax
 
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
this change could make it easier for low
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
and moderate income homeowners to get
 
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:35.929 --> 02:47:35.939 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue and
 
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
administration noted in a comment about
 
02:47:46.030 --> 02:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation that RSA 21j
 
02:47:49.969 --> 02:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
313 requires Equalization
 
02:47:52.490 --> 02:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
of valuations of property for each
 
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
municipality by May 1st and therefore
 
02:47:58.690 --> 02:47:58.700 align:start position:0%
the equalization ratio
 
02:48:01.550 --> 02:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
necessary for the property tax owners to
 
02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
calculate their property tax relief may
 
02:48:05.210 --> 02:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
not be available
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
by the February for us to filing I
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
believe that the Department of Revenue
 
02:48:12.469 --> 02:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
Administration can accommodate this
 
02:48:14.570 --> 02:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
earlier filing date because the
 
02:48:16.570 --> 02:48:16.580 align:start position:0%
calculation of the
 
02:48:19.190 --> 02:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
Equalization ratio
 
02:48:21.410 --> 02:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
I believe that they can have it well
 
02:48:24.410 --> 02:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
before May 1st they must calculate the
 
02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
equalization ratio to determine the
 
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
State education portion of the tax rate
 
02:48:33.410 --> 02:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
that is assessed on all New Hampshire
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
property owners that taxes assessed and
 
02:48:39.889 --> 02:48:39.899 align:start position:0%
collected by the local municipalities
 
02:48:42.010 --> 02:48:42.020 align:start position:0%
those numbers are typically available
 
02:48:45.710 --> 02:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
for the final Town tax bill issued in
 
02:48:48.650 --> 02:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
late November or early December
 
02:48:50.929 --> 02:48:50.939 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation does not change
 
02:48:53.330 --> 02:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
the eligibility requirements but the
 
02:48:56.270 --> 02:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
amount of the amount of relief it only
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
makes the application process less
 
02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:00.170 align:start position:0%
makes the application process less
burdensome

02:49:00.170 --> 02:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
burdensome
 
02:49:02.809 --> 02:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
I hope that this change would result in
 
02:49:05.330 --> 02:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
more eligible homeowners applying
 
02:49:07.969 --> 02:49:07.979 align:start position:0%
for in receiving the relief that they
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
deserve under the current law
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and welcome to try to answer any
 
02:49:15.469 --> 02:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
questions that you have thank you for
 
02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:23.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:49:23.389 --> 02:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:49:31.130 --> 02:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
you're asking that the department
 
02:49:31.140 --> 02:49:31.790 align:start position:0%
you're asking that the department
um

02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh produce a form that they produce
 
02:49:37.250 --> 02:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
yearly a little bit earlier than they
 
02:49:41.389 --> 02:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
normally do and the methodology the um
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
the department uh says that currently
 
02:49:47.870 --> 02:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
they're required to complete uh
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
that process by May 1st are would you be
 
02:49:54.290 --> 02:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
advocating for us to change that
 
02:49:56.590 --> 02:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
requirement that they complete the the
 
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
equalization evaluation of properties
 
02:50:05.450 --> 02:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
um by the by the uh before this deadline
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
that that would be one very good way of
 
02:50:13.730 --> 02:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh to do that yes because I believe that
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
they they have the data they need to do
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
it but before February 1st and if you if
 
02:50:21.710 --> 02:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
you wanted to require that they have
 
02:50:23.570 --> 02:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
that done by February 1st that would
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:31.849 --> 02:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
Representatives Davis
 
02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:35.170 align:start position:0%

um I'm reading the bill
 
02:50:59.210 --> 02:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
um jumping off on what representative
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
yokella asked is Is it feasible that
 
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
someone could put an application in
 
02:51:09.650 --> 02:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
on February 1st as this proposes yet not
 
02:51:12.050 --> 02:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
here their
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
outcome until after May 1st when all the
 
02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:17.210 align:start position:0%
outcome until after May 1st when all the
tax

02:51:17.210 --> 02:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
info is available from the town and the
 
02:51:23.389 --> 02:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
county that would also satisfy what my
 
02:51:26.690 --> 02:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
objective is my the but my objective is
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
that they they file it not that they
 
02:51:31.130 --> 02:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
necessarily get the money back early so
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
so perhaps that that is another thing
 
02:51:37.070 --> 02:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
that the you bring the filing deadline
 
02:51:39.650 --> 02:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
so that they they have their income
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
information that they can put on the dt8
 
02:51:43.969 --> 02:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
they can do the the property ownership
 
02:51:46.610 --> 02:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
questions that are on a dp8 submit all
 
02:51:49.730 --> 02:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
of that in yes and perhaps the
 
02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue doesn't actually
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
process it until May 1st that would be
 
02:51:56.690 --> 02:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
fine that that would still do what what
 
02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
I what I think what I'm trying to
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
achieve here thank you Mr Hamel
 
02:52:06.490 --> 02:52:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:09.710 --> 02:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative yakella
 
02:52:11.150 --> 02:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:13.490 --> 02:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
um it seems like
 
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
um you one one solution would be just
 
02:52:20.389 --> 02:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
have a a Perpetual form and not have one
 
02:52:22.370 --> 02:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
that come out each year but it seems
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
like the the reason that it comes out
 
02:52:26.450 --> 02:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
each year is that the eligibility
 
02:52:28.610 --> 02:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
changes and so you wouldn't necessarily
 
02:52:30.830 --> 02:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
know whether you would be eligible into
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
until the new formula comes out well the
 
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
the reason why they have to have a new
 
02:52:39.530 --> 02:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
form each year is because it's based
 
02:52:42.530 --> 02:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
upon the equalization ratio which which
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
changes every year so the the income
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
requirements for the person to get a get
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
the relief doesn't change but the amount
 
02:52:56.990 --> 02:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the relief does change and the um
 
02:52:59.990 --> 02:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
because it's based upon the the State
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
no more questions I have one brief one
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
for you
 
02:53:13.309 --> 02:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
um it appears you're the
 
02:53:15.769 --> 02:53:15.779 align:start position:0%
individual behind this bill did you
 
02:53:17.690 --> 02:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
contact the department of rev Revenue
 
02:53:21.170 --> 02:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
Administration no I did not like I said
 
02:53:24.590 --> 02:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
I I I'm just uh individual and didn't
 
02:53:27.050 --> 02:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
didn't really know
 
02:53:29.389 --> 02:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
the process that was needed
 
02:53:32.210 --> 02:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
I I went to representative Melville with
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
this idea and asked him to to bring it
 
02:53:38.170 --> 02:53:38.180 align:start position:0%
forward thank you any more questions
 
02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:52.370 --> 02:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:55.969 --> 02:53:55.979 align:start position:0%
seeing no Kate West what's that
 
02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
no no said individual
 
02:54:03.410 --> 02:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
okay I will close the hearing on HB
 
02:54:06.650 --> 02:54:06.660 align:start position:0%

uh blue sheet we had four people sign up
 
02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:13.319 --> 02:54:15.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

um representative
[Music]

02:54:18.050 --> 02:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:54:18.060 --> 02:54:20.330 align:start position:0%
[Music]
fellows

02:54:20.330 --> 02:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
02:54:22.670 --> 02:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
how long do you believe it will take you
 
02:54:30.170 --> 02:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
s

02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:36.170 --> 02:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
it's actually it's that hand out for the
 
02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.670 --> 02:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
would it be possible if you hung around
 
02:54:46.429 --> 02:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
for a while we have not taken our break
 
02:54:49.190 --> 02:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
you can't thank you we'll we'll take you
 
02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
up as soon as we come back we'll ask
 
02:54:53.570 --> 02:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
everybody come back at 1 30. we have a
 
02:54:55.550 --> 02:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
couple things we must get done
 
03:33:51.650 --> 03:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:58.010 --> 03:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
everybody else set we will open up the
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 99 FN
 
03:34:06.769 --> 03:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.490 --> 03:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
oops thank you and um good afternoon to
 
03:34:12.170 --> 03:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
um this bill does two things it changes
 
03:34:20.150 --> 03:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
the name of this program from property
 
03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
tax relief to property tax rebate the
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
reason that I'm doing this is because I
 
03:34:28.490 --> 03:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
think people understand a re that a
 
03:34:31.729 --> 03:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
rebate means that you get money back and
 
03:34:34.610 --> 03:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
relief doesn't have such a specific
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
meaning the second reason for chaining
 
03:34:40.490 --> 03:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
changing the title is that this past
 
03:34:43.309 --> 03:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
year I heard representatives from both
 
03:34:46.130 --> 03:34:46.140 align:start position:0%
parties refer to bills that were
 
03:34:48.910 --> 03:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
property tax relief and so I think
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
changing this to just say rebate would
 
03:34:55.010 --> 03:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
remove confusion with with just the the
 
03:34:55.020 --> 03:34:56.389 align:start position:0%
remove confusion with with just the the
general

03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:34:56.399 --> 03:34:56.990 align:start position:0%
general
um

03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
phrase that people are using so that's
 
03:35:02.269 --> 03:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
the first thing it does the second thing
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
it does is it um addresses the issue of
 
03:35:09.889 --> 03:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
people finding out about this program
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
um the what has happened is the rebates
 
03:35:17.630 --> 03:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
the eligibility caps to get a rebate
 
03:35:20.929 --> 03:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
under this program were increased last
 
03:35:24.370 --> 03:35:24.380 align:start position:0%
year so many more people are eligible
 
03:35:27.769 --> 03:35:27.779 align:start position:0%
and I don't have any data to support it
 
03:35:29.809 --> 03:35:29.819 align:start position:0%
but my belief is that it's primarily
 
03:35:32.690 --> 03:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
seniors that are benefiting from this
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
program because I think that in many
 
03:35:38.750 --> 03:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
cases people bought a house many decades
 
03:35:40.610 --> 03:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
ago and they could pay the property
 
03:35:42.769 --> 03:35:42.779 align:start position:0%
taxes when they were still working but
 
03:35:44.809 --> 03:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
now that they're seniors and living on
 
03:35:48.410 --> 03:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
fixed incomes that it they're struggling
 
03:35:51.410 --> 03:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
to do that so I think this there's a
 
03:35:54.490 --> 03:35:54.500 align:start position:0%
potential to help those people
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
when I brought this bill forward two
 
03:36:01.010 --> 03:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
years ago I had done some research using
 
03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
census data so at that time we didn't
 
03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
have the 20 20 Census Data yet but I
 
03:36:11.090 --> 03:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
think that at that time it would have
 
03:36:13.969 --> 03:36:13.979 align:start position:0%
been correct to say that about one in
 
03:36:17.450 --> 03:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
six homeowners would be eligible for
 
03:36:19.610 --> 03:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
this program but since then we've had
 
03:36:23.090 --> 03:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
covid we've had increases in wages we've
 
03:36:25.130 --> 03:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
had increases in house prices but that
 
03:36:26.809 --> 03:36:26.819 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you know that wouldn't um
 
03:36:30.309 --> 03:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
really affect this program
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
so what I saw after the first year of
 
03:36:35.809 --> 03:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
the program last year was the first year
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
with the new limits is that after eight
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
year eight straight years of the
 
03:36:44.630 --> 03:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment in this program declining
 
03:36:46.370 --> 03:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
which is something that you can see on
 
03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
the on the graph that I passed around it
 
03:36:54.429 --> 03:36:54.439 align:start position:0%
has turned around but it's disappointing
 
03:36:57.790 --> 03:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
that instead of decreasing four percent
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
it went up but only by four percent and
 
03:37:02.530 --> 03:37:02.540 align:start position:0%
I think that that's just another
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
indication that people don't know about
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:11.040 --> 03:37:11.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
so so that's why this bill asks the the
 
03:37:20.570 --> 03:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
um towns municipalities to put
 
03:37:22.910 --> 03:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
information about this bill on their
 
03:37:25.610 --> 03:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.490 --> 03:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
from the ask the municipalities to put
 
03:37:30.530 --> 03:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
information about this program on their
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
property tax bills that they send out
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
they're currently required to put some
 
03:37:37.790 --> 03:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
information on it this is just asking
 
03:37:40.729 --> 03:37:40.739 align:start position:0%
them to put specifically those income
 
03:37:44.690 --> 03:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
limits and tell them about the program
 
03:37:44.700 --> 03:37:46.070 align:start position:0%
limits and tell them about the program
so

03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:49.370 --> 03:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
I think I think that that will help one
 
03:37:51.650 --> 03:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I think that will help is
 
03:37:53.929 --> 03:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
this past
 
03:37:53.939 --> 03:37:55.570 align:start position:0%
this past
spring

03:37:55.570 --> 03:37:55.580 align:start position:0%
spring
 
03:37:57.769 --> 03:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
which is the first time this program
 
03:37:59.929 --> 03:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
came into effect with the up with the
 
03:38:03.170 --> 03:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
higher income limits one of the things I
 
03:38:05.690 --> 03:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
did I went to a new town that's part of
 
03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
my district and I went around and I put
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
I put up posters in the local grocery
 
03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
store and in the library and I knocked
 
03:38:19.010 --> 03:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
on a few more than a hundred doors and
 
03:38:22.610 --> 03:38:22.620 align:start position:0%
those doors were only people that I
 
03:38:25.490 --> 03:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
could tell from the registry of
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
properties were living in a home that
 
03:38:30.050 --> 03:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
they owned
 
03:38:33.610 --> 03:38:33.620 align:start position:0%
and what happened when I went back and
 
03:38:37.729 --> 03:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
asked dra last month you know if they
 
03:38:40.670 --> 03:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
could tell me specifically how many
 
03:38:44.510 --> 03:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
people in Ashland had applied
 
03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
two years ago and then applied in 2022
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
how many people participated you can see
 
03:38:56.330 --> 03:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
on the graph that before not a single
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
person Ashland's a fairly low income
 
03:39:02.150 --> 03:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
Community for sure there are many people
 
03:39:04.370 --> 03:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
that will qualify for this program and
 
03:39:06.610 --> 03:39:06.620 align:start position:0%
they simply just didn't know about it
 
03:39:09.769 --> 03:39:09.779 align:start position:0%
and afterwards you know this so when I
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
when I made an effort to try to inform
 
03:39:12.840 --> 03:39:13.750 align:start position:0%
when I made an effort to try to inform
people

03:39:13.750 --> 03:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:39:17.450 --> 03:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
18 people applied and so if it goes on
 
03:39:20.450 --> 03:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
their tax bill and the taxpayers see
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
that I think that there'll be even more
 
03:39:26.809 --> 03:39:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.819 --> 03:39:28.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:39:28.250 --> 03:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:31.190 --> 03:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:33.410 --> 03:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
When I Was preparing this bill one of
 
03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
the things I did is I went to dra and
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
asked them if they could move up the
 
03:39:39.290 --> 03:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
application date
 
03:39:41.929 --> 03:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
and the person that I spoke to is the
 
03:39:45.950 --> 03:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
one who does those equalized tables that
 
03:39:49.190 --> 03:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
is the thing that's that holds up the
 
03:39:52.190 --> 03:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
application until May and she explained
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
to me that there there was no way to get
 
03:39:57.710 --> 03:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
those that the data about the
 
03:40:01.309 --> 03:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
equalization and the tax rates
 
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
um until
 
03:40:06.050 --> 03:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
you know it until May so that's why the
 
03:40:08.450 --> 03:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
application the application period
 
03:40:10.490 --> 03:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't start until May and I didn't
 
03:40:13.190 --> 03:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
pursue it beyond that but from the
 
03:40:15.229 --> 03:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard on the last bill and
 
03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
from the um informed analysis that some
 
03:40:21.349 --> 03:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
committee members made here I think that
 
03:40:23.330 --> 03:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
makes me think it's quite doable that
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
they might be able to do that also I
 
03:40:27.530 --> 03:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
think that that one of the things that
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
could happen is they can have as some
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
people suggested a generic application
 
03:40:34.969 --> 03:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
that's the same all the time and all
 
03:40:37.790 --> 03:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
they're filling in is their income and
 
03:40:40.969 --> 03:40:40.979 align:start position:0%
then sending that to dra and when dra
 
03:40:42.769 --> 03:40:42.779 align:start position:0%
gets it and then they get the equalized
 
03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
valuation then they can they can fill
 
03:40:47.450 --> 03:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
that in but of course that would require
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
some probably investment in computer
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
application programs to do that
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note for this bill talks
 
03:41:01.849 --> 03:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
about the cost to the municipality to to
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
send out an application if they request
 
03:41:08.809 --> 03:41:08.819 align:start position:0%
it you know so you've got
 
03:41:11.690 --> 03:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
you know xeroxing right now there's
 
03:41:14.150 --> 03:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
right now there's eight pages but if
 
03:41:15.710 --> 03:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
they could make that change and let
 
03:41:17.630 --> 03:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
people apply earlier there would be
 
03:41:20.290 --> 03:41:20.300 align:start position:0%
fewer pages on the application
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
the cost of mailing that and and just
 
03:41:25.550 --> 03:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
copying the application I think that's a
 
03:41:27.530 --> 03:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
pretty small cost
 
03:41:31.809 --> 03:41:31.819 align:start position:0%
I know that the town clerk in in my town
 
03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
goes out of her way to help people
 
03:41:37.729 --> 03:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
you know all that in any way they can to
 
03:41:39.710 --> 03:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
help them pay their property tax bills I
 
03:41:42.050 --> 03:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
don't think they'd object to that and
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
while you can go to the dra website and
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
find the application you
 
03:41:53.330 --> 03:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
you would to you would have to
 
03:41:55.190 --> 03:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
um not only have a computer
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
you'd have to know where to go which
 
03:41:58.849 --> 03:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
could be a little bit of a challenge but
 
03:42:00.650 --> 03:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
you know if you know to go to dra you
 
03:42:02.750 --> 03:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
would find it you have to go two
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
different places to get a description of
 
03:42:06.530 --> 03:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
the program and also get the application
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
if it's there right now it's not even
 
03:42:10.910 --> 03:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
there because it's not the filing period
 
03:42:14.330 --> 03:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
but you'd also have to have you'd have
 
03:42:17.809 --> 03:42:17.819 align:start position:0%
to print it so you'd need a printer and
 
03:42:21.170 --> 03:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
you you also have to send them your um
 
03:42:23.570 --> 03:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
copy of your tax bill so you need a
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
scanner so that's really a big challenge
 
03:42:29.090 --> 03:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
I think for many of our seniors and I
 
03:42:31.490 --> 03:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
think it's a small price to pay
 
03:42:34.250 --> 03:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
to to help some people out with their
 
03:42:36.290 --> 03:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
03:42:38.570 --> 03:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
so I think that's
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's all about all that I have
 
03:42:44.690 --> 03:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
to to say
 
03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:42:48.410 --> 03:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
do you
 
03:42:50.450 --> 03:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony uh
 
03:42:56.150 --> 03:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:59.690 --> 03:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
03:43:03.889 --> 03:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
I'm just uh interested in your
 
03:43:07.610 --> 03:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
definition of the term rebate
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
to me the term rebate means you pay
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
something and then you get something
 
03:43:14.399 --> 03:43:16.429 align:start position:0%
something and then you get something
back

03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:43:20.210 --> 03:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying here
 
03:43:24.769 --> 03:43:24.779 align:start position:0%
um yes so there is one little things a
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
little bit different about that a rebate
 
03:43:29.210 --> 03:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
like if you go to the store and you you
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
buy something you know especially if you
 
03:43:34.969 --> 03:43:34.979 align:start position:0%
like energy saving Appliance you buy
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
that and then you send in your receipt
 
03:43:40.250 --> 03:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
and you get 25 back so this is the same
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
kind of thing the only thing that's a
 
03:43:44.870 --> 03:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
little bit different and they'd have to
 
03:43:47.229 --> 03:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
read the long instructions to understand
 
03:43:50.210 --> 03:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
is people who
 
03:43:50.220 --> 03:43:51.290 align:start position:0%
is people who
um

03:43:51.290 --> 03:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:53.630 --> 03:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
have a property tax bill but haven't
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
been able to pay it actually can get
 
03:44:01.550 --> 03:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:04.090 --> 03:44:04.100 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman
 
03:44:06.769 --> 03:44:06.779 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir go ahead
 
03:44:09.229 --> 03:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just interested in the
 
03:44:09.239 --> 03:44:11.150 align:start position:0%
I'm just interested in the
administrative

03:44:11.150 --> 03:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh timeline
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
to apply this could you go through that
 
03:44:20.389 --> 03:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know how would they pay their tax
 
03:44:23.210 --> 03:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:26.450 --> 03:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay so so let's say you you're you're
 
03:44:28.969 --> 03:44:28.979 align:start position:0%
eligible in terms of income for this
 
03:44:28.979 --> 03:44:29.809 align:start position:0%
eligible in terms of income for this
program

03:44:29.809 --> 03:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
so you're going to get a tax bill from
 
03:44:33.889 --> 03:44:33.899 align:start position:0%
the town and that you might get your tax
 
03:44:36.670 --> 03:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
bill like in November that's common time
 
03:44:40.130 --> 03:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
and on that is the one line that says
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
what how much of you're paying for that
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax it's
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
broken down on your bill
 
03:44:46.800 --> 03:44:48.410 align:start position:0%
broken down on your bill
and

03:44:48.410 --> 03:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
so right now
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
if you knew about the program you would
 
03:44:56.630 --> 03:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
be waiting until May
 
03:45:00.050 --> 03:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
to even see the application form because
 
03:45:01.969 --> 03:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
they don't post the application form
 
03:45:04.250 --> 03:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
with those tables until you get to May
 
03:45:08.090 --> 03:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
1st so you have to remember how long
 
03:45:08.100 --> 03:45:10.670 align:start position:0%
1st so you have to remember how long
your

03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know all that time that you're going
 
03:45:14.570 --> 03:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
to do that and then you have two two
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
weeks two months to do it so you so you
 
03:45:19.269 --> 03:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
fill it out you send in your application
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
dra is going to look at it if they have
 
03:45:23.690 --> 03:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
any questions they can contact you
 
03:45:25.729 --> 03:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
because there probably are problems
 
03:45:28.729 --> 03:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
sometimes and then they will send you
 
03:45:31.330 --> 03:45:31.340 align:start position:0%
they will send you it must be a check
 
03:45:35.809 --> 03:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
this is disconnected from when you go to
 
03:45:39.290 --> 03:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
your town clerk and pay your property
 
03:45:42.050 --> 03:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
tax bill as long as you have a copy of
 
03:45:44.870 --> 03:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
that bill it doesn't matter if you've
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
paid it or not because that's a
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
negotiation with the town this is with
 
03:45:53.450 --> 03:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that clarified it
 
03:45:55.680 --> 03:45:58.450 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that clarified it
exactly

03:45:58.450 --> 03:45:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:00.710 --> 03:46:00.720 align:start position:0%

you can tell me the population of
 
03:46:09.469 --> 03:46:09.479 align:start position:0%

03:46:12.170 --> 03:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
two thousand thank you more or less got
 
03:46:12.180 --> 03:46:13.389 align:start position:0%
two thousand thank you more or less got
it

03:46:13.389 --> 03:46:13.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:46:16.190 --> 03:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative Elward
 
03:46:18.889 --> 03:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for uh
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
testifying today
 
03:46:24.410 --> 03:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at line four of the proposed
 
03:46:24.420 --> 03:46:27.229 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at line four of the proposed
amendment

03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
that starts with the word relief
 
03:46:34.150 --> 03:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
line three all the types of tax relief
 
03:46:43.610 --> 03:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
then the omitted language includes tax
 
03:46:52.070 --> 03:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
exemption credit abatement or deferral
 
03:46:54.170 --> 03:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
so under the definition legal definition
 
03:46:57.530 --> 03:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
of relief that is a type of Assistance
 
03:47:01.190 --> 03:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
or Aid given to those in need especially
 
03:47:03.410 --> 03:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
Financial from the state
 
03:47:03.420 --> 03:47:05.630 align:start position:0%
Financial from the state
hmm

03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
03:47:09.769 --> 03:47:09.779 align:start position:0%
no so that word release the tax bill
 
03:47:12.590 --> 03:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
what you're reading is
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
the the word relief is current language
 
03:47:15.359 --> 03:47:17.870 align:start position:0%
the the word relief is current language
yes

03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:47:17.880 --> 03:47:19.670 align:start position:0%
yes
and

03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:19.680 --> 03:47:20.870 align:start position:0%
and
okay

03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:23.229 --> 03:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the legal definition
 
03:47:26.210 --> 03:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
yes I wanted to know which definition
 
03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
most in your opinion most fit the type
 
03:47:30.120 --> 03:47:30.830 align:start position:0%
most in your opinion most fit the type
of

03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:47:33.229 --> 03:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative fellows hold on a sec
 
03:47:35.150 --> 03:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative valward
 
03:47:36.950 --> 03:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
just when you have another question
 
03:47:39.650 --> 03:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
please bring that through the chair okay
 
03:47:40.969 --> 03:47:40.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:40.979 --> 03:47:42.889 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

03:47:42.889 --> 03:47:42.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
may I follow up with the
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
yes so rebate
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
is a return or part of a payment serving
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
as a discount or reduction
 
03:47:57.110 --> 03:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
so this is providing a discount or
 
03:48:00.170 --> 03:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
reduction to taxpayers qualified
 
03:48:00.180 --> 03:48:02.269 align:start position:0%
reduction to taxpayers qualified
taxpayers

03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
03:48:06.830 --> 03:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
the the amendment to this statute deals
 
03:48:09.650 --> 03:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
specifically well I mean except for the
 
03:48:12.410 --> 03:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
part that you're you're talking about it
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
deals with a with the um rebate
 
03:48:21.410 --> 03:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
that the state gives to the taxpayer and
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
that that's what I want to call rebate
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
in in line four
 
03:48:31.010 --> 03:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's old language and it's saying that
 
03:48:31.020 --> 03:48:32.990 align:start position:0%
that's old language and it's saying that
the

03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:36.290 --> 03:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
the town clerk should when they send out
 
03:48:38.050 --> 03:48:38.060 align:start position:0%
the tax bill
 
03:48:42.610 --> 03:48:42.620 align:start position:0%
tell the tax property taxpayers about
 
03:48:46.309 --> 03:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
all of the programs that could give them
 
03:48:48.769 --> 03:48:48.779 align:start position:0%
some kind of assistance
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
so they're not usually those are tax
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
credits like veterans tax credit elderly
 
03:49:01.090 --> 03:49:01.100 align:start position:0%
tax credit
 
03:49:05.690 --> 03:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
and if it's my understanding is
 
03:49:10.550 --> 03:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
if they're low income very low income
 
03:49:13.429 --> 03:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
they have to on my tax bill it says if
 
03:49:15.530 --> 03:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
they're very low income they have to
 
03:49:18.530 --> 03:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
apply for to the Selectmen
 
03:49:21.170 --> 03:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
which is some process that I don't
 
03:49:22.969 --> 03:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
understand I don't know what that
 
03:49:25.370 --> 03:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
process is but that's relief is kind of
 
03:49:29.090 --> 03:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
like a general category and in terms of
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
naming this particular program this
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
program is low in moderate income rebate
 
03:49:40.130 --> 03:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
of the State Property Tax Bill perfect
 
03:49:44.090 --> 03:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:46.729 --> 03:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative manager Puti thank you Mr
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
two thank you representative for taking
 
03:49:51.530 --> 03:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
my question so if I'm understanding
 
03:49:56.269 --> 03:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
correctly rebate the property tax for
 
03:49:58.849 --> 03:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
that particular property is the same
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's not changing it's the discount or
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
the rebate on that property tax because
 
03:50:07.250 --> 03:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
you're low income or so if the hand
 
03:50:09.530 --> 03:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
changes the property goes to somebody
 
03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
who's not a low income
 
03:50:13.550 --> 03:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
then they don't get the rebate
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
automatically correct that's corrected
 
03:50:20.809 --> 03:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
because what entitles them to the rebate
 
03:50:23.330 --> 03:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
really doesn't have anything to do with
 
03:50:25.969 --> 03:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
their property value it has to do with
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
their income they qualify because of
 
03:50:30.769 --> 03:50:30.779 align:start position:0%
their income but they but the only
 
03:50:34.250 --> 03:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
people that can get a tax rebate are
 
03:50:38.690 --> 03:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
people who own a a piece of property and
 
03:50:40.490 --> 03:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go into the details
 
03:50:42.190 --> 03:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
here about
 
03:50:46.370 --> 03:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
my new variations but those are not
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
changing those exist just one quick
 
03:50:49.560 --> 03:50:53.510 align:start position:0%
changing those exist just one quick
follow-ups

03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:57.290 --> 03:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
quickly yes okay so this is opposite to
 
03:51:01.490 --> 03:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
what the previous bills had you know it
 
03:51:04.010 --> 03:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
stays with the property
 
03:51:07.130 --> 03:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
the rebate not with the property it
 
03:51:10.010 --> 03:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
stays with the owner of that property at
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
that time
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
the rebates go to owners
 
03:51:17.330 --> 03:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
of owners
 
03:51:17.340 --> 03:51:18.830 align:start position:0%
of owners
who

03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
the rebate goes to homeowners who meet
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
the income requirements
 
03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative Powell thank you Mr
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:51:31.370 --> 03:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
question my question pertains to section
 
03:51:32.690 --> 03:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
one of the bill
 
03:51:32.700 --> 03:51:34.190 align:start position:0%
one of the bill
and

03:51:34.190 --> 03:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:38.210 --> 03:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
um could you please clarify for me it
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
says the tax bill shall contain a
 
03:51:43.610 --> 03:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
statement is this a separate insert in
 
03:51:46.969 --> 03:51:46.979 align:start position:0%
the envelope in which the bill comes or
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
is this information printed on the tax
 
03:51:49.319 --> 03:51:52.429 align:start position:0%
is this information printed on the tax
bill

03:51:52.429 --> 03:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.010 --> 03:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
so can you tell me which line you're
 
03:51:56.809 --> 03:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
looking at three
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
line three
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
well three four five the tax bill showed
 
03:52:05.210 --> 03:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
Oh contain a statement so this statement
 
03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
I think it says I think it says down
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
below the statement can either be on the
 
03:52:13.429 --> 03:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
property tax bill or it can be in on a
 
03:52:16.490 --> 03:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
separate piece of paper mine
 
03:52:18.650 --> 03:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
happens to be printed on the back side
 
03:52:20.929 --> 03:52:20.939 align:start position:0%
of my statement but
 
03:52:23.150 --> 03:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
it you know I well I think it would be
 
03:52:26.210 --> 03:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
great if the town wanted to put even
 
03:52:29.090 --> 03:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
more details have a whole piece of paper
 
03:52:33.170 --> 03:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
put even more details on this program
 
03:52:35.809 --> 03:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
and their own programs and put those in
 
03:52:38.690 --> 03:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
the in the envelope with the tax bill I
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
think that would be great but it doesn't
 
03:52:42.410 --> 03:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
require them to do anything beyond what
 
03:52:44.150 --> 03:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
it says here
 
03:52:44.160 --> 03:52:51.050 align:start position:0%
it says here
foreign

03:52:51.050 --> 03:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have just a quick
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
question uh you referenced the town
 
03:52:58.370 --> 03:52:58.380 align:start position:0%

03:53:01.630 --> 03:53:01.640 align:start position:0%

03:53:08.750 --> 03:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
there are there are clerk collectors who
 
03:53:10.729 --> 03:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
deal with taxes but that some just have
 
03:53:13.550 --> 03:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
a town clerk who does just this State
 
03:53:15.650 --> 03:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
registration so my questions I'm not
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
sure it may be because I'm not hearing I
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
can't hear you really well not all towns
 
03:53:24.530 --> 03:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
have a town clerk that collects taxes or
 
03:53:27.229 --> 03:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
processes taxes so I'm just wondering if
 
03:53:28.190 --> 03:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
you can
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
if you'd be willing to straighten out
 
03:53:31.969 --> 03:53:31.979 align:start position:0%
that language
 
03:53:34.130 --> 03:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
where you reference Town clerks mailing
 
03:53:36.349 --> 03:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
applications upon requests Town clerks
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
is that existing language what line are
 
03:53:43.250 --> 03:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
you looking at I don't have the line but
 
03:53:45.710 --> 03:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry is it okay if I ask for this
 
03:53:45.720 --> 03:53:47.809 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry is it okay if I ask for this
section

03:53:47.809 --> 03:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:53:50.269 --> 03:53:50.279 align:start position:0%
I keep saying clerks because in my town
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
the tax collector and the clerk are the
 
03:53:54.769 --> 03:53:54.779 align:start position:0%
same thing but I know in some towns they
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
are not the same thing
 
03:53:59.570 --> 03:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
but right I don't think I changed
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think I use the word clerk Oh Oh
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
you mean that line 19 on the first page
 
03:54:07.849 --> 03:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
the new paragraph assessment information
 
03:54:10.370 --> 03:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
so that I didn't I didn't make that up
 
03:54:12.290 --> 03:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
that was already in statute I didn't
 
03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:19.550 --> 03:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I see no
 
03:54:20.929 --> 03:54:20.939 align:start position:0%
hands raise
 
03:54:23.570 --> 03:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
we'll call an ex-witness who I do not
 
03:54:25.849 --> 03:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
see in the room
 
03:54:32.450 --> 03:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:34.969 --> 03:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
moving on to the other pink card I have
 
03:54:48.530 --> 03:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
um chairman turcotte and members of the
 
03:54:54.290 --> 03:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Catherine heck and
 
03:54:56.030 --> 03:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
I represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:54:59.290 --> 03:54:59.300 align:start position:0%
Association and I am just here to
 
03:55:03.410 --> 03:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
comment on parts of this bill we have no
 
03:55:05.689 --> 03:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
position on the state or the
 
03:55:09.290 --> 03:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
legislature's policy to provide this
 
03:55:11.570 --> 03:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
rebate program to taxpayers this is
 
03:55:14.689 --> 03:55:14.699 align:start position:0%
solely administered by the state it
 
03:55:16.610 --> 03:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
deals with the Statewide education tax
 
03:55:18.769 --> 03:55:18.779 align:start position:0%
and it has not nothing to do with
 
03:55:18.779 --> 03:55:20.210 align:start position:0%
and it has not nothing to do with
municipalities

03:55:20.210 --> 03:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
um the reason why I'm testifying today
 
03:55:25.370 --> 03:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
is because this bill does raise just a
 
03:55:27.889 --> 03:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
few concerns for us as now the
 
03:55:30.469 --> 03:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities will be in the middle of
 
03:55:32.929 --> 03:55:32.939 align:start position:0%
a state administered program so we
 
03:55:35.809 --> 03:55:35.819 align:start position:0%
really do appreciate wanting to make
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
sure the program is widely understood
 
03:55:40.189 --> 03:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
and known to all New Hampshire residents
 
03:55:42.050 --> 03:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
if they qualify for this program I think
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's extremely helpful for them so it's
 
03:55:45.849 --> 03:55:45.859 align:start position:0%
not to deter
 
03:55:48.950 --> 03:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
that visibility and the accessibility of
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
the program however as the bill is
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
written it does require perhaps
 
03:55:56.990 --> 03:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
additional information on the property
 
03:55:58.729 --> 03:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
tax bill so for those of you who read
 
03:56:00.290 --> 03:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
your bill you know there's already a lot
 
03:56:02.330 --> 03:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
of information so I'm just going to make
 
03:56:05.450 --> 03:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
a very broad assumption that just say a
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
second page is needed to be printed
 
03:56:09.290 --> 03:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
there will be a cost associated with
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
that with the average price of a copy on
 
03:56:13.490 --> 03:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
a commercial lease being two cents a
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
copy and there's 643
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
000 homeowners
 
03:56:21.650 --> 03:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
owner occupied properties and sometimes
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
tax bills are mailed out twice that
 
03:56:25.070 --> 03:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
would be a cost of about ninety six
 
03:56:26.410 --> 03:56:26.420 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide just for the copying so I
 
03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
understand that's not a major cost but
 
03:56:34.429 --> 03:56:34.439 align:start position:0%
again we're just shifting one tax burden
 
03:56:36.530 --> 03:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
from one place to another so that's just
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
one small consideration again using that
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
same data if one and six are estimated
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
to one in six homeowners are estimated
 
03:56:47.450 --> 03:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
to qualify for this bill
 
03:56:48.769 --> 03:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
um that would be
 
03:56:52.490 --> 03:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
approximately 63 000 dollars in Stamps
 
03:56:55.010 --> 03:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
sixteen thousand dollars in copies on
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
the town clerk side to issue the
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
application for seventy nine thousand
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
dollars so this is a small a small
 
03:57:03.530 --> 03:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
mandate financially for municipalities
 
03:57:05.330 --> 03:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't include anybody's time
 
03:57:08.030 --> 03:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
to process the application and mail it
 
03:57:10.729 --> 03:57:10.739 align:start position:0%
out but the larger concern that we have
 
03:57:14.510 --> 03:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
aside from this relatively small dollars
 
03:57:16.910 --> 03:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
um respectively would be that we did
 
03:57:19.309 --> 03:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
hear testimony earlier that these forms
 
03:57:20.990 --> 03:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
are eight pages long and they do take
 
03:57:22.610 --> 03:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
time to fill out and when the
 
03:57:24.889 --> 03:57:24.899 align:start position:0%
municipality becoming the intermediary
 
03:57:27.070 --> 03:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
the concern is that they would then be
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
required in some way or expected to
 
03:57:29.760 --> 03:57:31.030 align:start position:0%
required in some way or expected to
deliver

03:57:31.030 --> 03:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
03:57:34.849 --> 03:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
assistance in completing those forms So
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
currently again it goes to the dra and
 
03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
the dra administers this program so that
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
was just a concern that we would have on
 
03:57:44.570 --> 03:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
how that would be handled in the
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
municipality and who would handle that
 
03:57:49.790 --> 03:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
administrative piece so again it's just
 
03:57:51.889 --> 03:57:51.899 align:start position:0%
just some concerns that we wanted to
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
bring to light with the legislation so I
 
03:57:55.130 --> 03:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
can take any questions that you might
 
03:57:55.140 --> 03:57:57.349 align:start position:0%
can take any questions that you might
have

03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:59.689 --> 03:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
03:58:01.490 --> 03:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:58:03.050 --> 03:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you point out
 
03:58:04.689 --> 03:58:04.699 align:start position:0%
where in the bill
 
03:58:08.630 --> 03:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
this potential requested assistance is
 
03:58:08.640 --> 03:58:10.610 align:start position:0%
this potential requested assistance is
thanks

03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:58:13.729 --> 03:58:13.739 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying there is no I
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
think it's an a potential unintended
 
03:58:17.809 --> 03:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
consequence that if you go to your town
 
03:58:20.330 --> 03:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
clerk to request something to be mailed
 
03:58:22.010 --> 03:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
to them that you might come back to the
 
03:58:25.010 --> 03:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
town and also ask for them to assist in
 
03:58:27.170 --> 03:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
completing the documentation as a town
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
would be now the forward-facing people
 
03:58:33.250 --> 03:58:33.260 align:start position:0%
um handing out the applications
 
03:58:36.050 --> 03:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah just quickly to follow up
 
03:58:38.090 --> 03:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
so so there is no language in the bill
 
03:58:40.610 --> 03:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
as it's written now that
 
03:58:43.309 --> 03:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
makes that concern of yours an actual
 
03:58:46.610 --> 03:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
reality is hypothetical right based on
 
03:58:48.769 --> 03:58:48.779 align:start position:0%
the prior Bill's testimony that people
 
03:58:50.689 --> 03:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
need assistance filling out the eight
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
pages it's just a concern as I said not
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
a mandate
 
03:58:57.050 --> 03:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
03:58:59.570 --> 03:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
03:59:02.570 --> 03:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
testimony you said that this bill has
 
03:59:05.809 --> 03:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with municipalities and
 
03:59:08.389 --> 03:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
you also use the word mandate how come
 
03:59:10.330 --> 03:59:10.340 align:start position:0%
there was no comment that this is an
 
03:59:13.189 --> 03:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate they in your
 
03:59:16.670 --> 03:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
Association or us Osos Association
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm a selectman uh would be
 
03:59:23.450 --> 03:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill yeah so as I stated
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
that that is our opposition to some of
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
the language that it is indeed an
 
03:59:29.510 --> 03:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate which I apologize but I
 
03:59:31.250 --> 03:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
thought might have been implied in my
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
testimony no it was clear to me thank
 
03:59:35.889 --> 03:59:35.899 align:start position:0%
you thank you sir thank you Mr chairman
 
03:59:38.150 --> 03:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:59:41.809 --> 03:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:59:44.929 --> 03:59:44.939 align:start position:0%
um a rebate is coming back from the
 
03:59:47.809 --> 03:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
state does the town have to accept that
 
03:59:50.689 --> 03:59:50.699 align:start position:0%
money as unanticipated revenues or is it
 
03:59:54.790 --> 03:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
paid directly from dra to the resident
 
03:59:57.290 --> 03:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's paid directly
 
04:00:01.969 --> 04:00:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:08.150 --> 04:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking for a clarification on
 
04:00:10.610 --> 04:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
that last statement over there were you
 
04:00:13.790 --> 04:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
I don't care who it's from uh but my
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this is an
 
04:00:19.250 --> 04:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
existing man uh rebate that people
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to get we're just looking to
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
increase the dollar amount is that
 
04:00:22.560 --> 04:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
increase the dollar amount is that
correct

04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:27.769 --> 04:00:27.779 align:start position:0%
um well my understanding uh from the
 
04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
previous testimony and the sponsor of
 
04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
the bill that they are looking to
 
04:00:33.769 --> 04:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of applicants who
 
04:00:35.389 --> 04:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
are eligible who perhaps don't
 
04:00:37.790 --> 04:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
understand that this program exists on
 
04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
the state level to provide that relief
 
04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
to them
 
04:00:44.090 --> 04:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
so I think it would might naturally
 
04:00:46.490 --> 04:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
increase but perhaps the sponsor would
 
04:00:49.370 --> 04:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
like to speak more to her the intent
 
04:00:51.050 --> 04:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chamber could I have the spawn to
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
no uh we're going to continue on if
 
04:00:56.150 --> 04:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
you've got a follow-up you can do that
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
well yes because it seems to me that
 
04:01:00.469 --> 04:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
this is an existing program we're just
 
04:01:01.849 --> 04:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
looking to increase the dollar amount
 
04:01:03.290 --> 04:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
that these people around is that a
 
04:01:03.300 --> 04:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
that these people around is that a
question

04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:09.650 --> 04:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my question is is this
 
04:01:11.450 --> 04:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
just simply an increase to the dollar
 
04:01:14.330 --> 04:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
amount that's available to people that
 
04:01:16.849 --> 04:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
are homeowners as far as rebates
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
I think the bill does several things
 
04:01:21.950 --> 04:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
um that being one of them potentially
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
sir but I also think it it puts the
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
municipality in as the intermediary as
 
04:01:29.090 --> 04:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
it stated at the beginning of the bill
 
04:01:31.309 --> 04:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
that the municipality
 
04:01:33.110 --> 04:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
um on line four
 
04:01:36.110 --> 04:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
explain be able to share on the tax bill
 
04:01:38.689 --> 04:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
all types of tax relief available with
 
04:01:40.490 --> 04:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
this being one that we don't currently
 
04:01:42.769 --> 04:01:42.779 align:start position:0%
administer on a local level
 
04:01:46.250 --> 04:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:01:51.889 --> 04:01:51.899 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:01:51.899 --> 04:01:53.389 align:start position:0%
my question
it

04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
is it possible to say this is you know
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
the state uh without the municipality
 
04:02:04.250 --> 04:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
intervening or being an intermediary it
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to the taxpayers the
 
04:02:09.889 --> 04:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
taxpayers don't pay to the state so they
 
04:02:11.929 --> 04:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
pay the municipality and the cut is
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
taken so doesn't that make sense for the
 
04:02:17.210 --> 04:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
municipality to be the intermediary
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
because they receive the taxes and they
 
04:02:22.610 --> 04:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
send the cut to the state
 
04:02:25.729 --> 04:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
and vice versa if the state is giving
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
rebate for the taxpayers it should be
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
the municipality doing it because they
 
04:02:34.910 --> 04:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
already do that so their position to do
 
04:02:38.170 --> 04:02:38.180 align:start position:0%
that instead of creating another loop so
 
04:02:42.290 --> 04:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
this bill is structured in that uh
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
resident homeowner pays a hundred
 
04:02:47.389 --> 04:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
percent of their tax bill over and if
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
they qualify they get a rebate directly
 
04:02:52.969 --> 04:02:52.979 align:start position:0%
paid to them right so the municipality
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
is not we are collecting the taxes and
 
04:02:59.570 --> 04:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
the state is then reimbursing the
 
04:03:01.130 --> 04:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
eligible homeowner based on the
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
administration of the program so the
 
04:03:06.650 --> 04:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
municipality really isn't involved in
 
04:03:09.650 --> 04:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
that in that process in that way all we
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
do is send the regular tax bill and
 
04:03:14.809 --> 04:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
collect the funds
 
04:03:18.650 --> 04:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
to share just a clarification no we're
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
gonna move on unless you have a specific
 
04:03:24.410 --> 04:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
question about something she testified
 
04:03:24.420 --> 04:03:34.250 align:start position:0%
question about something she testified
on

04:03:34.250 --> 04:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:36.610 --> 04:03:36.620 align:start position:0%
I am trying to understand
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities already doing that for
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities where the taxpayer pays
 
04:03:47.570 --> 04:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
the taxes representative manager Puti
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
she's shook her head as to know they are
 
04:03:53.330 --> 04:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
not doing that and again we do not
 
04:03:56.750 --> 04:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
debate with Thee thank you testifiers
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%

04:04:02.399 --> 04:04:03.170 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss heck thank you for your
time

representative Juliet Harvey bully

um and I'm here to introduce house bill
154.

04:06:33.530 --> 04:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
154.
 
04:06:33.540 --> 04:06:34.309 align:start position:0%
154.
um

04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
and just note that last year this
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
committee passed a similar bill on the
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and I thank them for
 
04:06:43.560 --> 04:06:44.750 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and I thank them for
that

04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:46.729 --> 04:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
um this bill here is even less
 
04:06:49.969 --> 04:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
objectional in my objectionable in my
 
04:06:52.370 --> 04:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
opinion uh because it doesn't change any
 
04:06:54.889 --> 04:06:54.899 align:start position:0%
regulatory Powers but basically what
 
04:06:57.769 --> 04:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
this is is you know the an act relative
 
04:07:00.889 --> 04:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
to the adoption of or how Public Health
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:08.410 --> 04:07:08.420 align:start position:0%
so uh last year's Bill
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me changed um and made a
 
04:07:14.570 --> 04:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
definitive list of what kinds of uh
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
items Health officers could regulate
 
04:07:20.050 --> 04:07:20.060 align:start position:0%
upon this avoids that uh
 
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
at any rate and uh basically it's very
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
simple it requires that they can they
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
can pass anything
 
04:07:29.640 --> 04:07:30.229 align:start position:0%
can pass anything
um

04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
but it has to be finally approved by a
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
majority of the legislative body at an
 
04:07:37.250 --> 04:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
annual or special meeting
 
04:07:39.530 --> 04:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
this for uh it doesn't change anything
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
it only seeks to allow the legislative
 
04:07:43.729 --> 04:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
body of the town to deliberate and to
 
04:07:45.530 --> 04:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
vote on the ordinance
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
this bill will provide for robust local
 
04:07:52.490 --> 04:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
control by the communities about their
 
04:07:55.370 --> 04:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
own town ordinances the legislative body
 
04:07:57.370 --> 04:07:57.380 align:start position:0%
of a town
 
04:08:01.670 --> 04:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
is the is its registered voters as
 
04:08:04.370 --> 04:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
probably most of you know
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
um that is the rule-making body for a
 
04:08:11.929 --> 04:08:11.939 align:start position:0%
town is different than cities those who
 
04:08:14.210 --> 04:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
show up to vote at a town meeting are
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
the legislative body annual or special
 
04:08:18.769 --> 04:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
meetings I mean
 
04:08:22.010 --> 04:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
um so you know how many public hearings
 
04:08:24.170 --> 04:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
are required to pass a public health
 
04:08:26.090 --> 04:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
ordinance under this
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:34.610 --> 04:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
public hearings and arguably no public
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
meetings either because the law as it's
 
04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
written now
 
04:08:41.330 --> 04:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
says that they may pass the regulations
 
04:08:43.969 --> 04:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
which will take effect when approved by
 
04:08:45.530 --> 04:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen
 
04:08:48.670 --> 04:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
and then recorded and published
 
04:08:52.610 --> 04:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
similar to signing an invoice perhaps
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh it's there's no requirement for them
 
04:08:58.490 --> 04:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
to be discussed deliberated upon in a
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
public meeting
 
04:09:04.010 --> 04:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
I find this woefully inadequate
 
04:09:04.020 --> 04:09:07.250 align:start position:0%
I find this woefully inadequate
um

04:09:07.250 --> 04:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:09.290 --> 04:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
I think we'd all agree the public
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
hearings are the bare minimum
 
04:09:15.889 --> 04:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
for passing of ordinances and such they
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
can affect everyone in town
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
um so how many public hearings are
 
04:09:24.410 --> 04:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
required to change the zoning ordinance
 
04:09:26.090 --> 04:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
in a town
 
04:09:28.969 --> 04:09:28.979 align:start position:0%
two two public hearings followed by a
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
vote by the legislative body on the
 
04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
question was put on the ballot people
 
04:09:35.929 --> 04:09:35.939 align:start position:0%
are deliberate on them
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and it's very common every year in my
 
04:09:40.130 --> 04:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
town we
 
04:09:42.830 --> 04:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
get our public hearings and we get to
 
04:09:45.170 --> 04:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
vote on our zoning ordinance it's a
 
04:09:47.150 --> 04:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
great thing
 
04:09:49.809 --> 04:09:49.819 align:start position:0%
um so this RSA
 
04:09:54.110 --> 04:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh only pertains to towns uh not cities
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
the cities in my understanding have a
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
board of health and a different process
 
04:10:01.610 --> 04:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
Health officers are lay people in many
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
cases especially in small towns often
 
04:10:06.710 --> 04:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
they do the job of they have two jobs in
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
the town for instance
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
and so many of them have no Health
 
04:10:13.010 --> 04:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
Training other than the three hours that
 
04:10:14.929 --> 04:10:14.939 align:start position:0%
they get from the state
 
04:10:19.729 --> 04:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
Health officers are also employees and
 
04:10:22.490 --> 04:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh you know so it's we don't have
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
employees making regulations
 
04:10:28.370 --> 04:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
in fact I believe this ordinance has uh
 
04:10:30.889 --> 04:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
led to some confusion in the past
 
04:10:32.929 --> 04:10:32.939 align:start position:0%
uh during the pandemic
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh Health officer cited this
 
04:10:39.889 --> 04:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
and enacted a uh Public Health ordinance
 
04:10:39.899 --> 04:10:41.210 align:start position:0%
and enacted a uh Public Health ordinance
without

04:10:41.210 --> 04:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
a vote of the select board which
 
04:10:46.969 --> 04:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
I believe is improper but I'm not going
 
04:10:49.729 --> 04:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
to go into that so is this ordinance
 
04:10:51.530 --> 04:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
consistent with the division of Public
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
Health Services yes
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
the the manual states that Health
 
04:10:57.950 --> 04:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
officers are to provide a supportive
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
role when addressing communicable
 
04:11:01.550 --> 04:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
disease emergencies and emergency
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
planning are coordinated by the
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management director of a town
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 21-p colon Knight 39
 
04:11:12.530 --> 04:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
towns are supposed to have Emergency
 
04:11:14.450 --> 04:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
Management directors and they're
 
04:11:15.650 --> 04:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a team of people
 
04:11:19.250 --> 04:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
addressing emergencies one of the issues
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
about this bill that was raised is a
 
04:11:25.130 --> 04:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
concern was well what what does towns do
 
04:11:27.469 --> 04:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
in an emergency well
 
04:11:29.330 --> 04:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
that's what especially that's why I put
 
04:11:30.769 --> 04:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
in special meeting
 
04:11:32.689 --> 04:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
so they can do it in an annual or
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
special meeting special meetings can be
 
04:11:34.439 --> 04:11:36.070 align:start position:0%
special meeting special meetings can be
called

04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
called
 
04:11:39.290 --> 04:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
as the town needs them it's uh no
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
different really than any other meeting
 
04:11:44.929 --> 04:11:44.939 align:start position:0%
or calling it a an annual meeting so
 
04:11:47.090 --> 04:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
given that there may be some sort of
 
04:11:47.100 --> 04:11:48.429 align:start position:0%
given that there may be some sort of
emergency

04:11:48.429 --> 04:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:11:52.130 --> 04:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
they can call a special meeting
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
um so lastly this does not affect Public
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
Health orders uh I know people raise all
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of concerns you know molds
 
04:12:09.610 --> 04:12:09.620 align:start position:0%
drinking water quarantining bed bugs and
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
rodents and all those sort of things
 
04:12:13.969 --> 04:12:13.979 align:start position:0%
that Health officers deal with there are
 
04:12:16.610 --> 04:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
rsas that deal with all of those in turn
 
04:12:19.010 --> 04:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the statute
 
04:12:21.530 --> 04:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
this is just for all the sort of
 
04:12:21.540 --> 04:12:23.050 align:start position:0%
this is just for all the sort of
catch-all

04:12:23.050 --> 04:12:23.060 align:start position:0%
catch-all
 
04:12:26.570 --> 04:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
things that may not be addressed but
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
they to my understanding from what I
 
04:12:31.010 --> 04:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
heard from nhma they're almost this is
 
04:12:32.530 --> 04:12:32.540 align:start position:0%
almost never
 
04:12:36.889 --> 04:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
people almost never use this RSA 147 to
 
04:12:39.290 --> 04:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
adopt ordinances we really didn't see it
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
until the pandemic
 
04:12:46.010 --> 04:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
um so you know that leads me to
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
some examples
 
04:12:50.809 --> 04:12:50.819 align:start position:0%
um but I just wanted to add that adding
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
public hearings to this process of
 
04:12:55.330 --> 04:12:55.340 align:start position:0%
drafting Town regulations ordinance
 
04:12:58.729 --> 04:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
ordinances are is a smart idea
 
04:13:01.130 --> 04:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
not only does it enfranchise our voters
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
in the process but it eliminates obvious
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
errors that often happen in plague towns
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
for decades there are loads of examples
 
04:13:13.370 --> 04:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
and you guys are all tired and I respect
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
that but just a couple For Your
 
04:13:15.359 --> 04:13:16.729 align:start position:0%
that but just a couple For Your
Entertainment

04:13:16.729 --> 04:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
Entertainment
 
04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was the town of Kingston
 
04:13:20.269 --> 04:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
that passed a liquor ordinance that
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited liquor from being on public
 
04:13:25.250 --> 04:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
streets or in any kind of public way
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't specify unopened bottles or
 
04:13:29.570 --> 04:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
open bottles
 
04:13:32.090 --> 04:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
so it appears that you cannot bring
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
liquor home
 
04:13:36.170 --> 04:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
using streets
 
04:13:38.510 --> 04:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
um it when I was in the tent when I was
 
04:13:41.050 --> 04:13:41.060 align:start position:0%
on the planning board in Tilton we had a
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
coordinates that limited home-based
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
businesses to such an extent that people
 
04:13:48.530 --> 04:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
working from home on their laptops were
 
04:13:51.050 --> 04:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
not sure if they needed site plan review
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh because the ordinance said any any
 
04:13:57.110 --> 04:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
business that's done from home needed
 
04:13:58.490 --> 04:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
site plan review
 
04:14:01.490 --> 04:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
so I wrote the uh ordinance along with
 
04:14:03.170 --> 04:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
the rest of the planning board and we
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
had our two hearings
 
04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
and we voted on it as a town we passed
 
04:14:10.370 --> 04:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
it and now people don't uh have to
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
pretend that they're hiding uh their
 
04:14:15.889 --> 04:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
cookie making business at home or doing
 
04:14:18.530 --> 04:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
a little work from home
 
04:14:22.370 --> 04:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
um so that's what I have for you I
 
04:14:25.490 --> 04:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
would love to hear uh your opinions on
 
04:14:25.500 --> 04:14:26.870 align:start position:0%
would love to hear uh your opinions on
that

04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much
 
04:14:31.309 --> 04:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you would
 
04:14:33.110 --> 04:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
not like to hear our opinions you would
 
04:14:35.210 --> 04:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
like to answer any questions that we may
 
04:14:37.250 --> 04:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
have okay yes thank you thank you very
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
much representative yeah
 
04:14:42.170 --> 04:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair not an opinion it's a
 
04:14:42.180 --> 04:14:43.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair not an opinion it's a
question

04:14:43.010 --> 04:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:14:45.050 --> 04:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
do you see any contradiction between the
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill that you're
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
of proposing here and RSA 128 colon 5
 
04:14:56.210 --> 04:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
which enumerates the duties of the Town
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
Health officer
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy of 128
 
04:15:03.710 --> 04:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
um I have I don't have it I but I have
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
read it
 
04:15:05.520 --> 04:15:06.290 align:start position:0%
read it
um

04:15:06.290 --> 04:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry follow-up Mr chair I I I think
 
04:15:09.720 --> 04:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry follow-up Mr chair I I I think
that

04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:14.210 --> 04:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
this bill of passed might result in some
 
04:15:16.490 --> 04:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
substantial confusion between the two so
 
04:15:18.530 --> 04:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm asking if you
 
04:15:21.170 --> 04:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
would consider looking more closely at
 
04:15:24.769 --> 04:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
128 colon 5 to see if there are
 
04:15:26.990 --> 04:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
contradictions if that's something you'd
 
04:15:27.000 --> 04:15:28.729 align:start position:0%
contradictions if that's something you'd
consider

04:15:28.729 --> 04:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
consider
 
04:15:31.070 --> 04:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Davis I've
 
04:15:32.630 --> 04:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
seen that
 
04:15:35.809 --> 04:15:35.819 align:start position:0%
um provision in the statute I'm very
 
04:15:37.969 --> 04:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
familiar with it um I
 
04:15:39.889 --> 04:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
I believe there is quite a bit of
 
04:15:39.899 --> 04:15:41.269 align:start position:0%
I believe there is quite a bit of
confusion

04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
04:15:41.279 --> 04:15:41.929 align:start position:0%
confusion
um

04:15:41.929 --> 04:15:41.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
in all of in in
 
04:15:48.410 --> 04:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
several of our health officer statutes
 
04:15:51.410 --> 04:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
um that I don't want to go into but for
 
04:15:51.420 --> 04:15:52.910 align:start position:0%
um that I don't want to go into but for
instance

04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
instance
 
04:15:55.610 --> 04:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
um Health officers are supposed to work
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the select board and
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
that is mentioned elsewhere in the rsas
 
04:16:03.130 --> 04:16:03.140 align:start position:0%
as well but it's not included here
 
04:16:05.570 --> 04:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit of cleanup I think
 
04:16:07.729 --> 04:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
and and clarification that needs to be
 
04:16:10.729 --> 04:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
done overall one thing I forgot to
 
04:16:14.990 --> 04:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
mention is that if you read all of the
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire division of Public Health
 
04:16:18.849 --> 04:16:18.859 align:start position:0%
Services Health officer manual
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
guidance all of it says that as far as
 
04:16:24.530 --> 04:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
communicable disease goes Health
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
officers are supposed to in towns are
 
04:16:28.969 --> 04:16:28.979 align:start position:0%
supposed to provide a supportive role
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
educational role to the town and report
 
04:16:35.050 --> 04:16:35.060 align:start position:0%
back numbers of
 
04:16:37.490 --> 04:16:37.500 align:start position:0%

Etc
 
04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mention anything about uh
 
04:16:45.010 --> 04:16:45.020 align:start position:0%
regulate you know
 
04:16:49.130 --> 04:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
sort of taking up going out on their own
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
tackling it without the benefit of the
 
04:16:55.870 --> 04:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management director or the
 
04:16:58.790 --> 04:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
select board Etc
 
04:17:01.130 --> 04:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
representative Elwood
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
your testimony today
 
04:17:10.910 --> 04:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the the title of the
 
04:17:13.790 --> 04:17:13.800 align:start position:0%

04:17:13.800 --> 04:17:16.070 align:start position:0%

ordinances
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
and then I'm reading the first line line
 
04:17:18.960 --> 04:17:20.150 align:start position:0%
and then I'm reading the first line line
two

04:17:20.150 --> 04:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:17:23.410 --> 04:17:23.420 align:start position:0%
the health officers of towns may make
 
04:17:23.420 --> 04:17:25.210 align:start position:0%
the health officers of towns may make
regulations

04:17:25.210 --> 04:17:25.220 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it shouldn't say
 
04:17:27.840 --> 04:17:29.269 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it shouldn't say
propose

04:17:29.269 --> 04:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
propose
 
04:17:29.279 --> 04:17:32.990 align:start position:0%
propose
ordinances

04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.809 --> 04:17:35.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:17:38.929 --> 04:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
is that a question or I'm asking you if
 
04:17:42.969 --> 04:17:42.979 align:start position:0%
it should read propose ordinances versus
 
04:17:46.189 --> 04:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
make regulations representative Harvey
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.969 --> 04:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
for the for your edification when you
 
04:17:55.010 --> 04:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
see language
 
04:17:57.769 --> 04:17:57.779 align:start position:0%
that is not highlighted or crossed out
 
04:18:00.130 --> 04:18:00.140 align:start position:0%
that is existing language
 
04:18:02.510 --> 04:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
so we're here
 
04:18:05.330 --> 04:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
not that that you're necessarily wrong
 
04:18:07.849 --> 04:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of language in rsas that
 
04:18:10.729 --> 04:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
have written tremendously poorly but we
 
04:18:14.269 --> 04:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
are only speaking right now to the uh to
 
04:18:17.929 --> 04:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
the proposed language change yes sir
 
04:18:17.939 --> 04:18:19.010 align:start position:0%
the proposed language change yes sir
okay

04:18:19.010 --> 04:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:18:21.889 --> 04:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the proposed language
 
04:18:21.899 --> 04:18:27.050 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the proposed language
correct

04:18:27.050 --> 04:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:29.630 --> 04:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
um ordinances are by the legislative
 
04:18:33.050 --> 04:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.969 --> 04:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
I find it confusing that it says
 
04:18:34.979 --> 04:18:44.050 align:start position:0%
I find it confusing that it says
regulations

04:18:44.050 --> 04:18:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:46.969 --> 04:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to debate correct
 
04:18:50.210 --> 04:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
only ask questions thank you sorry about
 
04:18:53.929 --> 04:18:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:55.790 --> 04:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative uh
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%

president of the New Hampshire Health
 
04:19:15.650 --> 04:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
office Association I'm here to address
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
the with the committee and discuss Bill
 
04:19:18.060 --> 04:19:19.630 align:start position:0%
the with the committee and discuss Bill
154

04:19:19.630 --> 04:19:19.640 align:start position:0%
154
 
04:19:23.950 --> 04:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh which is a revision to RSA
 
04:19:26.929 --> 04:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
147.1 which has been discussed as new
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
assistance and so forth uh
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
154 adds a sentence to 147.1 which
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
states Health Options that may make
 
04:19:36.650 --> 04:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
regulations for the prevention of
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
nuisances and other public health
 
04:19:41.210 --> 04:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
hazards which must be approved by the
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
voters of the town
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
under normal circumstances a health
 
04:19:49.010 --> 04:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
officer as may have already been said is
 
04:19:51.290 --> 04:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
part of the Board of Health which also
 
04:19:53.809 --> 04:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
includes the select board and is a clerk
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
of the Board of Health which permits
 
04:19:58.370 --> 04:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
them to make recommendations to the
 
04:19:59.450 --> 04:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
select board
 
04:20:03.170 --> 04:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh the uh Health officer does not make
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
the recommend does not make the
 
04:20:08.150 --> 04:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
regulations or ordinances or and so
 
04:20:09.650 --> 04:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
forth it's up to the select board
 
04:20:13.370 --> 04:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
themselves what normally happens is a
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
health officer may see a need for public
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
health and bring it to the select board
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
which they work with continuously
 
04:20:21.530 --> 04:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the year
 
04:20:24.530 --> 04:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh the board debates this
 
04:20:28.189 --> 04:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
in a normal public meeting if it's
 
04:20:31.130 --> 04:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
determined that is necessary or it is
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
prudent to form an ordinance this is put
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
out to a public meeting which is noticed
 
04:20:41.210 --> 04:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
properly and the public has input both
 
04:20:43.010 --> 04:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
at the select board meeting where
 
04:20:46.210 --> 04:20:46.220 align:start position:0%
they're attending and at the uh
 
04:20:49.910 --> 04:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
scheduled public hearing uh generally
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
anybody is interested provocon of any
 
04:20:55.309 --> 04:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
type of Regulation or ordinance will
 
04:20:57.769 --> 04:20:57.779 align:start position:0%
attend that meeting make this statement
 
04:21:01.790 --> 04:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh known and in normally once that
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
meeting is held the select board will
 
04:21:06.290 --> 04:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
determine if an audience is necessary
 
04:21:09.229 --> 04:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
we see that working very well right now
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
we do not see an extra step of bringing
 
04:21:15.650 --> 04:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
it to the town meeting which may be up
 
04:21:17.870 --> 04:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
to a year away from the time of that
 
04:21:21.229 --> 04:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
actual proposal and it just adds time
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
and administrative work to the uh the
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
local communities so local Health
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
offices Association sees this as
 
04:21:31.849 --> 04:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
unnecessary in duplication uh taking
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
additional time and cost for the
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.689 --> 04:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
representative Brown you have a question
 
04:21:43.250 --> 04:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for taking my
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
question I guess your testimony seems to
 
04:21:47.870 --> 04:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
be in Conflict what was originally
 
04:21:47.880 --> 04:21:49.429 align:start position:0%
be in Conflict what was originally
introduced

04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
04:21:51.650 --> 04:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
you indicate that there's already a
 
04:21:53.450 --> 04:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
process where the select board has to
 
04:21:55.550 --> 04:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
approve these ordinances am I correct
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay and then you also
 
04:21:59.570 --> 04:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
say that the select yeah the follow-up
 
04:22:02.030 --> 04:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
question represents I'm sorry
 
04:22:04.010 --> 04:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'll get this follow-up follow-up
 
04:22:07.490 --> 04:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
question so the selectman and the
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management director
 
04:22:11.929 --> 04:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
work in conjunction with the health
 
04:22:11.939 --> 04:22:13.910 align:start position:0%
work in conjunction with the health
official

04:22:13.910 --> 04:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
official
 
04:22:17.210 --> 04:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
to determine this and then
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
they have review of that in public
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
hearing that's how it's re required now
 
04:22:24.410 --> 04:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
I cannot be positive if it happens in
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
every town in the state I know in my
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
community and in most communities it
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.389 --> 04:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
04:22:37.610 --> 04:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:22:37.620 --> 04:22:39.050 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

04:22:39.050 --> 04:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it seems like the the
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
example that you were describing would
 
04:22:48.769 --> 04:22:48.779 align:start position:0%
be a ordinance not made through this law
 
04:22:48.779 --> 04:22:50.929 align:start position:0%
be a ordinance not made through this law
um

04:22:50.929 --> 04:22:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any
 
04:22:57.530 --> 04:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
um of this specific uh law and how it
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be implemented without
 
04:23:04.090 --> 04:23:04.100 align:start position:0%
um going through the selectman uh uh
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
ordinance process but the actual health
 
04:23:11.090 --> 04:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
of Health Public Health ordinances
 
04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
a health officer would always work
 
04:23:15.410 --> 04:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
through the select board it would always
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
go through this process it wouldn't be
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
any type of Regulation uh brought forth
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
in the community without input of the
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:32.689 --> 04:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
a new line of questioning
 
04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
a new line of questioning not a yeah so
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
give give anyone I see no other
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
questioner so go ahead
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
04:23:43.020 --> 04:23:44.090 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
question

04:23:44.090 --> 04:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:23:44.100 --> 04:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:45.600 --> 04:23:46.790 align:start position:0%
um
in

04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
in a town that uh that passed uh Health
 
04:23:51.000 --> 04:23:52.610 align:start position:0%
in a town that uh that passed uh Health
ordinance

04:23:52.610 --> 04:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
04:23:52.620 --> 04:23:53.269 align:start position:0%
ordinance
um

04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:57.670 --> 04:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
for example uh uh Atkinson that requires
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
tattoo artists to be medical doctors
 
04:24:04.250 --> 04:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
um do you see that there is any benefit
 
04:24:07.130 --> 04:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
of having the uh
 
04:24:11.929 --> 04:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
that the public May view that as as over
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
Broad and overstepping their bounds and
 
04:24:17.150 --> 04:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
may wish to be able to vote at a town
 
04:24:19.370 --> 04:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
meeting to say this is inappropriate and
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to vote this proposed
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
regulation down
 
04:24:24.229 --> 04:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
do you see there's any value in that
 
04:24:26.150 --> 04:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and of course they can bring
 
04:24:27.889 --> 04:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
that up as an article out of town
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
meeting that certainly uh they just need
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
to uh request a form get a number of
 
04:24:37.010 --> 04:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
signatures and it goes on the town
 
04:24:40.010 --> 04:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
meeting agenda so that certainly can be
 
04:24:43.130 --> 04:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
done in most cases where the town uh
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
citizens of the Town come before the
 
04:24:47.809 --> 04:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
select board questions are asked and
 
04:24:51.170 --> 04:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
answered uh and often uh the board may
 
04:24:54.050 --> 04:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
change their mind if they're a majority
 
04:24:56.809 --> 04:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
of the townspeople who do not want a
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
particular ordinance uh is likely not to
 
04:24:59.520 --> 04:25:07.010 align:start position:0%
particular ordinance uh is likely not to
pass

04:25:07.010 --> 04:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.150 --> 04:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:13.130 --> 04:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and I have
 
04:25:16.490 --> 04:25:16.500 align:start position:0%

the new homeowner must apply for a

property tax exemption if if they are
 
04:28:30.889 --> 04:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
applicable HB 433 is a constituent bill
 
04:28:33.610 --> 04:28:33.620 align:start position:0%
that Miss Don griska who is here today
 
04:28:36.889 --> 04:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
she is the assistant to the select board
 
04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
and the Town Administrator and she
 
04:28:44.330 --> 04:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
brought this bill to me because we are
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
losing funding in our town our Revenue
 
04:28:53.990 --> 04:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
rather in our town from the delay in
 
04:28:56.689 --> 04:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
anyone finding out that the exemption
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
has gone to the new homeowner and so
 
04:29:01.849 --> 04:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
this bill will put a mechanism in place
 
04:29:06.170 --> 04:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
to help us recoup that Revenue
 
04:29:06.180 --> 04:29:06.889 align:start position:0%
to help us recoup that Revenue
um

04:29:06.889 --> 04:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:09.530 --> 04:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
I asked that Don griska can come up and
 
04:29:13.269 --> 04:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
testify she is the expert on this in our
 
04:29:17.389 --> 04:29:17.399 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:29:49.010 --> 04:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
this bill the new section lists out
 
04:29:49.020 --> 04:29:50.570 align:start position:0%
this bill the new section lists out
exemptions

04:29:50.570 --> 04:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
04:29:53.450 --> 04:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
and my question is is there a reason why
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
the exemption for the deaf in hearing
 
04:29:58.750 --> 04:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
impaired under RSA
 
04:30:03.410 --> 04:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
38-b is excluded from this list of
 
04:30:06.889 --> 04:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
exemption tax credits or exemptions
 
04:30:10.030 --> 04:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
so that might be for Dawn but my my
 
04:30:13.929 --> 04:30:13.939 align:start position:0%
understanding would be that that
 
04:30:18.110 --> 04:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
exemption goes with the person and not
 
04:30:23.929 --> 04:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.450 --> 04:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
so there are some exemptions that go for
 
04:30:30.769 --> 04:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
property that like um current use
 
04:30:34.250 --> 04:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
but there are certain credits that stay
 
04:30:36.370 --> 04:30:36.380 align:start position:0%
um like if a veteran moved into
 
04:30:38.450 --> 04:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
purchased a house and moved into a house
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
that veteran would still be able to have
 
04:30:47.389 --> 04:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.490 --> 04:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
04:30:49.500 --> 04:30:51.050 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
um

04:30:51.050 --> 04:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:54.649 --> 04:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
would it be would you be willing to look
 
04:30:56.929 --> 04:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
into the exemptions that are listed in
 
04:31:00.110 --> 04:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
and and note that I would be and
 
04:31:00.120 --> 04:31:01.250 align:start position:0%
and and note that I would be and
additionally

04:31:01.250 --> 04:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
04:31:01.260 --> 04:31:02.090 align:start position:0%
additionally
um

04:31:02.090 --> 04:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:06.889 --> 04:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
could you please look at 28-a
 
04:31:09.290 --> 04:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
and verify that as well because when I
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
did look that up that was repealed in
 
04:31:11.760 --> 04:31:14.330 align:start position:0%
did look that up that was repealed in
2003.

04:31:14.330 --> 04:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
2003.
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
so this was done by
 
04:31:20.210 --> 04:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
um uh OLS and I did not verify those so
 
04:31:24.290 --> 04:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:26.450 --> 04:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's 38a
 
04:31:28.340 --> 04:31:28.350 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
04:31:28.350 --> 04:31:30.349 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative

[Music]
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you once again Mr chair thanks for
 
04:31:35.330 --> 04:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
testifying and taking my question I'm
 
04:31:37.550 --> 04:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have an idea in regards
 
04:31:40.570 --> 04:31:40.580 align:start position:0%
to the length of time it takes
 
04:31:44.090 --> 04:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
for a municipality or town town or a
 
04:31:47.630 --> 04:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
city to discern that the property has
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
been sold and the person receiving the
 
04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
exemption has moved out of the property
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh that is one of the problems that we
 
04:31:58.370 --> 04:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
are having not being able to identify
 
04:31:58.380 --> 04:31:59.809 align:start position:0%
are having not being able to identify
that

04:31:59.809 --> 04:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:03.229 --> 04:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
um and there is an RSA about this but it
 
04:32:06.649 --> 04:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it clear how we move
 
04:32:11.210 --> 04:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
forward in in removing
 
04:32:13.130 --> 04:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
those exemptions that don't apply to
 
04:32:13.140 --> 04:32:14.090 align:start position:0%
those exemptions that don't apply to
them

04:32:14.090 --> 04:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:32:17.290 --> 04:32:17.300 align:start position:0%
for the new homeowner follow-up Mr chair
 
04:32:19.550 --> 04:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'm confused
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
how can
 
04:32:22.969 --> 04:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
mentality no
 
04:32:24.769 --> 04:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
OK that a property has been sold
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman has an exemption
 
04:32:29.929 --> 04:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
for her person right and she sold me her
 
04:32:32.330 --> 04:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
house I don't have an exemption for my
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
person right you as a municipality know
 
04:32:36.410 --> 04:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
the house has been sold how can you not
 
04:32:36.420 --> 04:32:37.250 align:start position:0%
the house has been sold how can you not
know

04:32:37.250 --> 04:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:32:40.130 --> 04:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
so I don't handle that end of it at the
 
04:32:43.550 --> 04:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
town but Dawn does and she is here to
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
answer those types of questions because
 
04:32:48.110 --> 04:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
she is intimately involved in that and
 
04:32:50.330 --> 04:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
she works with the assessor thank you in
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:57.769 --> 04:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
um you might
 
04:32:57.779 --> 04:32:59.389 align:start position:0%
um you might
you

04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:33:01.969 --> 04:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
you wanted just the mic's on so I
 
04:33:03.530 --> 04:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
thought you were going to talk that's
 
04:33:05.631 --> 04:33:05.641 align:start position:0%
okay did you have a question
 
04:33:05.641 --> 04:33:08.209 align:start position:0%
okay did you have a question
representative

04:33:08.209 --> 04:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:09.650 --> 04:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
question is your current understanding
 
04:33:11.279 --> 04:33:12.170 align:start position:0%
question is your current understanding
that

04:33:12.170 --> 04:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:14.330 --> 04:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:33:16.970 --> 04:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
if the town doesn't notify in a
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time that
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the tax
 
04:33:22.080 --> 04:33:23.109 align:start position:0%
um the tax
um

04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:27.230 --> 04:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
Bill may not necessarily be adjusted or
 
04:33:29.090 --> 04:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
be able to be adjusted and so therefore
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
if they issued a bill let's say on on on
 
04:33:37.730 --> 04:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
June that if the person moved out at the
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
beginning uh late May or whatever then
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
the it should be adjusted and prorated
 
04:33:45.289 --> 04:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
to be a different amount but there's no
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
real process to do that now and so
 
04:33:50.689 --> 04:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
there's uh some potential loss Revenue
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
in there correct okay there is and and
 
04:33:57.170 --> 04:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
and with that we are working with the
 
04:33:59.330 --> 04:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
um Catherine heck who was here before
 
04:34:05.150 --> 04:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
she's working with us we know we need an
 
04:34:08.209 --> 04:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
amendment on a couple of things so we
 
04:34:10.131 --> 04:34:10.141 align:start position:0%
will be doing that
 
04:34:11.810 --> 04:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you just wanted to let you
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.269 --> 04:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative save us
 
04:34:18.650 --> 04:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:34:20.449 --> 04:34:20.459 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:34:20.459 --> 04:34:22.131 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:34:22.131 --> 04:34:22.141 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:25.970 --> 04:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at a line
 
04:34:28.609 --> 04:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
five of the bill
 
04:34:33.890 --> 04:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
which ends with the words shall expire
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't that isn't that kind of
 
04:34:38.269 --> 04:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
determinative of everything we're
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
04:34:43.609 --> 04:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
if upon filing a real estate transfer
 
04:34:45.890 --> 04:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
with the register of deeds property tax
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
credit or exemption shall expire yes
 
04:34:55.609 --> 04:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
so for some reason they they it it has
 
04:34:58.849 --> 04:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
been transferred at least into our town
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
um and I believe there are other towns
 
04:35:02.570 --> 04:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
that are having this issue as well that
 
04:35:05.810 --> 04:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
they are not finding they are not the
 
04:35:08.449 --> 04:35:08.459 align:start position:0%
these exemptions are not being removed I
 
04:35:09.890 --> 04:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
don't know whether that's the fault of
 
04:35:13.369 --> 04:35:13.379 align:start position:0%
the assessor or or
 
04:35:16.131 --> 04:35:16.141 align:start position:0%
I I am not sure why that is
 
04:35:16.141 --> 04:35:17.209 align:start position:0%
I I am not sure why that is
um

04:35:17.209 --> 04:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:21.709 --> 04:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate place for
 
04:35:28.910 --> 04:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
fixing that very local problem a state
 
04:35:28.920 --> 04:35:30.529 align:start position:0%
fixing that very local problem a state
RSA

04:35:30.529 --> 04:35:30.539 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:35:33.410 --> 04:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
or is it a hyper local problem being
 
04:35:36.051 --> 04:35:36.061 align:start position:0%
experienced by a few towns and a few
 
04:35:39.051 --> 04:35:39.061 align:start position:0%
counties here and there
 
04:35:41.090 --> 04:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that
 
04:35:41.100 --> 04:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that
question

04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:45.719 --> 04:35:47.689 align:start position:0%

04:35:49.730 --> 04:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
once again thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
04:35:51.709 --> 04:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:35:53.570 --> 04:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
um isn't
 
04:35:55.730 --> 04:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't any town in the state of New
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire receive a deed from the
 
04:36:00.529 --> 04:36:00.539 align:start position:0%

04:36:06.410 --> 04:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
again I would refer that to Dawn thank
 
04:36:06.420 --> 04:36:08.631 align:start position:0%
again I would refer that to Dawn thank
you

04:36:08.631 --> 04:36:08.641 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
um

04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
basic question the rebate tax rebate tax
 
04:36:23.150 --> 04:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
is the taxpayer it's attached to the
 
04:36:26.810 --> 04:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
taxpayer yes the tax amount is attached
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the property so that when the
 
04:36:31.131 --> 04:36:31.141 align:start position:0%
property is transferred automatically it
 
04:36:35.570 --> 04:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
has to go isn't it that's the process
 
04:36:37.490 --> 04:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't understand the
 
04:36:37.500 --> 04:36:40.670 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't understand the
question

04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.680 --> 04:36:45.529 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:36:45.529 --> 04:36:45.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:47.209 --> 04:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
representative 11 did you have another
 
04:36:50.209 --> 04:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
question or no sir I'm sorry yeah no
 
04:36:50.219 --> 04:36:52.730 align:start position:0%
question or no sir I'm sorry yeah no
problem

04:36:52.730 --> 04:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other uh questions thank
 
04:36:56.570 --> 04:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony we'll call next
 
04:37:10.689 --> 04:37:10.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.131 --> 04:37:13.141 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon thank you for
 
04:37:14.570 --> 04:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
your time hopefully I can quickly
 
04:37:14.580 --> 04:37:15.769 align:start position:0%
your time hopefully I can quickly
clarify

04:37:15.769 --> 04:37:15.779 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:37:20.090 --> 04:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
so the way the system is set up now if a
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
Property Transfers at a certain period
 
04:37:24.289 --> 04:37:24.299 align:start position:0%
of time of year
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
property valuations are as of April 1st
 
04:37:29.390 --> 04:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
if a property sells that has a credit or
 
04:37:32.090 --> 04:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
an exemption at a certain time period
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
because it is a first half second half
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
an owner that purchases a property can
 
04:37:42.529 --> 04:37:42.539 align:start position:0%
receive a tax bill for the second half
 
04:37:44.810 --> 04:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
that still reflects the credit and
 
04:37:47.449 --> 04:37:47.459 align:start position:0%
exemption that they did not apply for
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
because it is a reflective moment it's
 
04:37:54.349 --> 04:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh the entire valuation as of April 1.
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
so if it sells
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
after that period but before
 
04:38:02.570 --> 04:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
the second tax bill
 
04:38:04.849 --> 04:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
you have a person who has not applied
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
for a veterans credit who has not
 
04:38:08.570 --> 04:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
applied for a blind exemption for a deaf
 
04:38:11.209 --> 04:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
exemption for an elderly exemption that
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
is receiving the benefit of that credit
 
04:38:15.650 --> 04:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
because it's the taxation as of the
 
04:38:18.890 --> 04:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
value of the house as of April 1st
 
04:38:22.730 --> 04:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
what I am seeking to have changed is uh
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
some form uh we're still working out the
 
04:38:26.570 --> 04:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
technical details some sort of a
 
04:38:26.580 --> 04:38:27.949 align:start position:0%
technical details some sort of a
municipal

04:38:27.949 --> 04:38:27.959 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
um re-accounting so that second half tax
 
04:38:30.840 --> 04:38:31.789 align:start position:0%
um re-accounting so that second half tax
bill

04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:38:34.849 --> 04:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
is credited so that you know the new
 
04:38:37.131 --> 04:38:37.141 align:start position:0%
owner who is not a veteran who is not
 
04:38:39.170 --> 04:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
elderly who is not disabled
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't get a credit for which they
 
04:38:43.551 --> 04:38:43.561 align:start position:0%
don't qualify
 
04:38:46.131 --> 04:38:46.141 align:start position:0%
the way the system is now they
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
automatically get the credit or the
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
exemption regardless of whether or not
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
they have applied
 
04:38:53.039 --> 04:38:59.051 align:start position:0%
they have applied
foreign

04:38:59.051 --> 04:38:59.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
for questions I assume thank you
 
04:39:03.949 --> 04:39:03.959 align:start position:0%
representative yukela
 
04:39:06.170 --> 04:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:08.689 --> 04:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
um what is your understanding of when
 
04:39:08.699 --> 04:39:10.551 align:start position:0%
um what is your understanding of when
the

04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:13.310 --> 04:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
um change would actually occur for the
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
person that is not eligible anymore
 
04:39:18.769 --> 04:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
would the would it automatically be the
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
next year in on that uh April 1st
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
so the way it it's an interaction
 
04:39:28.730 --> 04:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
between April 1st and then September
 
04:39:32.150 --> 04:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
first was at the ms-1 so depending on
 
04:39:32.160 --> 04:39:33.590 align:start position:0%
first was at the ms-1 so depending on
like

04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:39:36.109 --> 04:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
um the worst of it would be between say
 
04:39:37.788 --> 04:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
something a property that sold between
 
04:39:40.730 --> 04:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
September one the the deadline for the
 
04:39:43.130 --> 04:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
ms-1 and the next tax bill
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
so then that person if they were to sell
 
04:39:47.630 --> 04:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
their home in that period of time it
 
04:39:49.730 --> 04:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
would not be reflected again until the
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
next cycle
 
04:39:54.050 --> 04:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
because it's an estimated first half as
 
04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
the first bill the final half is the
 
04:39:57.850 --> 04:39:57.860 align:start position:0%
second bill
 
04:40:01.930 --> 04:40:01.940 align:start position:0%
so by some sort of accrediting system
 
04:40:05.868 --> 04:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
that second half would get wiped from
 
04:40:08.810 --> 04:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
the taxation almost like
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
um like when you're paying the first
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
bill you're doing an estimated first
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
half the second bill is whatever the
 
04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
remainder is it would almost be as if
 
04:40:22.010 --> 04:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
there was a credit to it a debited
 
04:40:24.110 --> 04:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
credit if that makes sense
 
04:40:26.810 --> 04:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
so say someone has an exemption that is
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollars for the whole year
 
04:40:30.590 --> 04:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars first half fifty dollar
 
04:40:33.770 --> 04:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
second half it sells between the two
 
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
halves right now the second person the
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
new owner receives that fifty dollar
 
04:40:40.970 --> 04:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
credit regardless of whether or not
 
04:40:43.010 --> 04:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
they've applied whether or not they this
 
04:40:45.170 --> 04:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
would be a system that says okay that
 
04:40:47.930 --> 04:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars doesn't belong to that
 
04:40:49.610 --> 04:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
fifty dollar credit doesn't belong to
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
that that person no longer owns that
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
property and it would be some sort of a
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
technical balancing of the books if you
 
04:41:00.590 --> 04:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
would to take that 50 credit off the
 
04:41:02.930 --> 04:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
books so that they receive just a
 
04:41:04.730 --> 04:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
regular tax bill no credits no
 
04:41:09.530 --> 04:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay hello
 
04:41:14.448 --> 04:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
once again thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
04:41:16.368 --> 04:41:16.378 align:start position:0%
so much for coming in to testify before
 
04:41:18.170 --> 04:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
us today
 
04:41:20.208 --> 04:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
um my first question
 
04:41:22.250 --> 04:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
because I may have another question but
 
04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
my first question is when that second
 
04:41:27.470 --> 04:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
tax bill is sent out
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
does it have the text bills I've seen
 
04:41:33.170 --> 04:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
that have exemptions on them say
 
04:41:37.010 --> 04:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
Mary Jones and Edward Jones and the tax
 
04:41:39.288 --> 04:41:39.298 align:start position:0%
and they say veterans exemption right on
 
04:41:40.490 --> 04:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:41:43.368 --> 04:41:43.378 align:start position:0%
the numbers right there so if the bill
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
came to me
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
and I bought their house and I wasn't
 
04:41:48.890 --> 04:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
Mary Jones and I wasn't Edward Jones
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
would I know by reading the bill that I
 
04:41:54.410 --> 04:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
am not qualified for that exemption not
 
04:41:54.420 --> 04:41:56.090 align:start position:0%
am not qualified for that exemption not
necessarily

04:41:56.090 --> 04:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
um different tax software different
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
assessing software
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
present that data on the tax bill in
 
04:42:04.910 --> 04:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
different ways so certain software
 
04:42:08.208 --> 04:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
systems it is just baked into it in some
 
04:42:10.490 --> 04:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
software systems it is called out
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
I understand follow-up Please Mr chair
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you very much thanks for
 
04:42:18.288 --> 04:42:18.298 align:start position:0%
taking another question
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that a human being is
 
04:42:24.050 --> 04:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
running the software the tax bills that
 
04:42:27.128 --> 04:42:27.138 align:start position:0%
go out from most of our towns and cities
 
04:42:30.050 --> 04:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
and that that person might even have a
 
04:42:32.890 --> 04:42:32.900 align:start position:0%
change of address form on file and send
 
04:42:36.770 --> 04:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
the tax bill to the new owner and I
 
04:42:38.690 --> 04:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
understand about its estimated first and
 
04:42:40.970 --> 04:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's real second if they're in that
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
window wouldn't you assume that they
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
would notice that there's an exemption
 
04:42:47.350 --> 04:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
on that bill that doesn't belong to that
 
04:42:51.050 --> 04:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay that's so the the
 
04:42:51.060 --> 04:42:52.550 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay that's so the the
the

04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
the gist of it is we recognize that it
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
it is being given to someone who is not
 
04:43:02.330 --> 04:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
applied but the way the statute is
 
04:43:04.610 --> 04:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
written now we are not allowed to just
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
make it go away at the time of transfer
 
04:43:08.690 --> 04:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
we are required to leave it right where
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
it is it it pains assessing officials it
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
pains Town clerks tax collectors
 
04:43:17.288 --> 04:43:17.298 align:start position:0%
many towns admittedly as I understand
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
probably just
 
04:43:21.708 --> 04:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
do it anyways
 
04:43:24.170 --> 04:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
the statute says and admittedly this
 
04:43:26.510 --> 04:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
came up in a conversation with our dra
 
04:43:28.730 --> 04:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
representative who said Thou shalt not
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
change it and we said that's not fair
 
04:43:33.650 --> 04:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
that's not right and thank you thank you
 
04:43:35.330 --> 04:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the clarification
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
I've learned a bunch of things today
 
04:43:38.160 --> 04:43:40.250 align:start position:0%
I've learned a bunch of things today
representative

04:43:40.250 --> 04:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:43:42.410 --> 04:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
04:43:42.420 --> 04:43:43.730 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

04:43:43.730 --> 04:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
if the sale takes place between the time
 
04:43:51.110 --> 04:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
of the the end of the first half
 
04:43:55.368 --> 04:43:55.378 align:start position:0%
and the end of the period period in
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
other words halfway between what what
 
04:44:00.890 --> 04:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
adjustment is made then
 
04:44:02.810 --> 04:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
and if any
 
04:44:04.850 --> 04:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
do you understand a question I'm not too
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
clear of myself if I know what the
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
question was myself I'd be delighted to
 
04:44:10.368 --> 04:44:10.378 align:start position:0%
answer if we give it one more go of the
 
04:44:13.970 --> 04:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
question yeah so if the sale takes place
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
after the half year
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
but before the end of the year what kind
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
of an adjustment is made now not what
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
should be done but what no there is not
 
04:44:25.320 --> 04:44:26.448 align:start position:0%
should be done but what no there is not
okay

04:44:26.448 --> 04:44:26.458 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:28.730 --> 04:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
the new owner just receives the Creditor
 
04:44:31.250 --> 04:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
exemption that they did not apply for
 
04:44:33.830 --> 04:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
so just for the edification of the board
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
if the chairman will allow me
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
I bought a house representative
 
04:44:43.250 --> 04:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
a veterans exemption on it
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
and it was still on it when I at the end
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
when I got the second Bill and because
 
04:44:52.128 --> 04:44:52.138 align:start position:0%
I'm a public servant I went back and
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
told the Town Clerk and made an
 
04:44:55.490 --> 04:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
adjustment which you are trying to do
 
04:44:57.410 --> 04:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that correct it this
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
is why that is why what you experienced
 
04:45:03.170 --> 04:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
is what we were trying to fix thank you
 
04:45:05.868 --> 04:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative majority
 
04:45:07.368 --> 04:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I certainly understand where where
 
04:45:13.368 --> 04:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
you and officials would be concerned
 
04:45:15.170 --> 04:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:45:17.570 --> 04:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
um do you know how can you tell me how
 
04:45:19.310 --> 04:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
many complaints
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
from property owners who experience this
 
04:45:25.730 --> 04:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:29.270 --> 04:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
none not not follow up mister
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay thanks no no the concern is
 
04:45:37.970 --> 04:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
predominantly lost Revenue
 
04:45:40.448 --> 04:45:40.458 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
04:45:40.458 --> 04:45:42.170 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
foreign

04:45:42.170 --> 04:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:45:45.288 --> 04:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is it
 
04:45:47.410 --> 04:45:47.420 align:start position:0%
your understanding or your knowledge
 
04:45:51.530 --> 04:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
that this is occurring in all towns
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:00.770 --> 04:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.930 --> 04:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you Mr
 
04:46:04.368 --> 04:46:04.378 align:start position:0%
chair I should have kept going with that
 
04:46:07.310 --> 04:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
too but when they receive so so my
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
question is when they receive that next
 
04:46:12.350 --> 04:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
bill we've got a bump how do you explain
 
04:46:15.470 --> 04:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
that to them and then is that perfectly
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
crystal clear to them which they in
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
which bump new people
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
suddenly now have a bump because the
 
04:46:26.570 --> 04:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
exemption has expired
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
there is a bump on their tax bill why I
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
assume they asked that question of you
 
04:46:35.208 --> 04:46:35.218 align:start position:0%
why and perhaps I misunderstood your no
 
04:46:37.490 --> 04:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
I didn't I I I was trying to make it we
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
have never got a complaint saying hey
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
I've got a credit I really not you know
 
04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
I want to give it back we have gotten
 
04:46:47.390 --> 04:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
conversations and credits to say my
 
04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
previous bill was this much less and now
 
04:46:51.530 --> 04:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
there's this bump why and we have to
 
04:46:53.628 --> 04:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
explain that that's the way the law is
 
04:46:53.638 --> 04:46:55.810 align:start position:0%
explain that that's the way the law is
written

04:46:55.810 --> 04:46:55.820 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:02.090 --> 04:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I got a quick I got a
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
quickie if they could you have a quick
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
question yes a very quick question go
 
04:47:07.610 --> 04:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Guthrie thank you
 
04:47:09.170 --> 04:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:47:13.730 --> 04:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
what happens if somebody buys a home
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
has as a veteran say
 
04:47:19.128 --> 04:47:19.138 align:start position:0%
the exemption is not on the second half
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill can he or she recover that
 
04:47:22.440 --> 04:47:25.670 align:start position:0%
of the bill can he or she recover that
exemption

04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:28.128 --> 04:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
sorry I could ask one more time
 
04:47:31.368 --> 04:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
person buys the house they they have a
 
04:47:34.570 --> 04:47:34.580 align:start position:0%
legitimate they're a veteran but the
 
04:47:38.990 --> 04:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill does not have a veterans exemption
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
it's the second half of the bill can
 
04:47:43.970 --> 04:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
they can they recover that or get that
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
rebate so there is a deadline filing
 
04:47:49.010 --> 04:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
period for filing for credits and
 
04:47:51.530 --> 04:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
exemptions So in theory one of the
 
04:47:53.448 --> 04:47:53.458 align:start position:0%
technical details we would look at aside
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
from making sure that the bill didn't
 
04:47:58.850 --> 04:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
get added inappropriately I would almost
 
04:48:01.368 --> 04:48:01.378 align:start position:0%
think it's just as fair to change the
 
04:48:04.730 --> 04:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
deadline period to be more rolling so
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
that whenever you are a veteran and or
 
04:48:10.010 --> 04:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
able disabled blind whatnot you apply to
 
04:48:12.170 --> 04:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
the system and through this system
 
04:48:15.770 --> 04:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
whatever time of year it was you could
 
04:48:19.368 --> 04:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
receive the credit all right thank you
 
04:48:21.410 --> 04:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony last
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman once again
 
04:48:42.350 --> 04:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
and committee members my name is
 
04:48:43.730 --> 04:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
Catherine heck for the record I
 
04:48:45.230 --> 04:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
Association and we support the concept
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
of this legislation and that people are
 
04:48:54.050 --> 04:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
taxed and pay a tax bill that's fair and
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate and accurate and we are
 
04:48:58.970 --> 04:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
working with the sponsor to fix what we
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
believe are some technical concerns
 
04:49:04.368 --> 04:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
based on how we currently set our tax
 
04:49:07.490 --> 04:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
rate there's approximately 25 forms
 
04:49:09.288 --> 04:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
involved in setting the tax rate that
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
are filed throughout the course of the
 
04:49:13.368 --> 04:49:13.378 align:start position:0%
year they're all one point in time forms
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
which is why this exists and we are
 
04:49:18.650 --> 04:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
looking for the technical fix so that
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
this bill might be able to come forward
 
04:49:24.050 --> 04:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
and be implemented properly so if you
 
04:49:25.850 --> 04:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
have any questions please let me know we
 
04:49:28.128 --> 04:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
do not have an amendment to offer yet at
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative of your color
 
04:49:35.150 --> 04:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
um you said that you're you're working
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the to come up with the solution
 
04:49:42.050 --> 04:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
are you is it your belief that what is
 
04:49:44.090 --> 04:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
the time frame of that is are you
 
04:49:46.128 --> 04:49:46.138 align:start position:0%
thinking within this legislative cycle
 
04:49:46.138 --> 04:49:48.470 align:start position:0%
thinking within this legislative cycle
or

04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
that's a great question well I we think
 
04:49:54.288 --> 04:49:54.298 align:start position:0%
it's important that all the stakeholders
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
be involved so the clerks the asset the
 
04:49:58.910 --> 04:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
tax collectors rather the assessors and
 
04:50:01.448 --> 04:50:01.458 align:start position:0%
sitting down to make sure that whatever
 
04:50:04.850 --> 04:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
is proposed can be properly implemented
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
so when it comes before you for a
 
04:50:09.470 --> 04:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
decision so we're not exactly sure on
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
that timeline but we're working on it as
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
diligently as we can because we
 
04:50:17.330 --> 04:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:20.570 --> 04:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
any other any other questions I see none
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
I have one uh a long representative of
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
the ocalas
 
04:50:24.600 --> 04:50:26.690 align:start position:0%
the ocalas
question

04:50:26.690 --> 04:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:50:28.730 --> 04:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
do you see the logistics of the
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
implementation of this of being
 
04:50:33.650 --> 04:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
fairly significant
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
I think it depends on the solution that
 
04:50:38.570 --> 04:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
we can come up with
 
04:50:41.208 --> 04:50:41.218 align:start position:0%
um so I I honestly don't have an answer
 
04:50:42.650 --> 04:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
04:50:44.510 --> 04:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
but I think there's a reason why the
 
04:50:46.910 --> 04:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
statute is whether it is currently and
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
why this hasn't been able to be
 
04:50:50.810 --> 04:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
addressed I do think that there's some
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
out of the box thinking that would have
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
to occur
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:01.730 --> 04:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
04:51:03.770 --> 04:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
are there any other individuals wishing

okay we'll open up the hearing on HP
 
04:51:39.050 --> 04:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:51:44.750 --> 04:51:44.760 align:start position:0%

04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
if anybody has pink cards please uh put
 
04:51:59.150 --> 04:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
them over by the sign in sheets there
 
04:52:01.550 --> 04:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
and then we can uh have them delivered
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:24.730 --> 04:52:24.740 align:start position:0%

and interest in hearing this bill
 
04:52:32.868 --> 04:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
in my life before becoming very recently
 
04:52:34.490 --> 04:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
a representative I'm a public health
 
04:52:36.288 --> 04:52:36.298 align:start position:0%
dietitian diabetes educator I think you
 
04:52:38.570 --> 04:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
all should take a stretch
 
04:52:40.550 --> 04:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
long day eh
 
04:52:42.590 --> 04:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
so for the record I am representative
 
04:52:44.448 --> 04:52:44.458 align:start position:0%

stream all public select board and
 
04:53:09.050 --> 04:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
school board meetings it would create a
 
04:53:10.850 --> 04:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
permanent record of these meetings and
 
04:53:12.770 --> 04:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
most importantly provide the same
 
04:53:15.050 --> 04:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability that
 
04:53:17.448 --> 04:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
YouTube of our house public hearings now
 
04:53:19.250 --> 04:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
routinely makes available
 
04:53:21.288 --> 04:53:21.298 align:start position:0%
while this does currently happen in some
 
04:53:22.550 --> 04:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
communities throughout the state
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
including Claremont and Sunapee and my

own District It Is by no means Universal
 
04:53:30.288 --> 04:53:30.298 align:start position:0%
making our local government process more
 
04:53:32.570 --> 04:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
visible increases trust in the work of
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
our dedicated volunteer elected
 
04:53:37.070 --> 04:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
officials it invites greater citizen
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
awareness and participation
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
it likely has future benefit by
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
increasing candidates for local
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
positions that's what's happened in
 
04:53:46.330 --> 04:53:46.340 align:start position:0%
Croydon since we started doing this
 
04:53:48.890 --> 04:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
especially in our small rural towns
 
04:53:50.810 --> 04:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
where often seats are filled by the only
 
04:53:53.150 --> 04:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
person running sometimes regardless of
 
04:53:54.770 --> 04:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
their Fitness for office
 
04:53:56.750 --> 04:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps it even creates greater
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
appreciation of the work of elected
 
04:53:58.320 --> 04:53:59.448 align:start position:0%
appreciation of the work of elected
officials

04:53:59.448 --> 04:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:54:02.270 --> 04:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
you understandably might ask why is this
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
needed as people can attend these public
 
04:54:04.200 --> 04:54:05.330 align:start position:0%
needed as people can attend these public
meetings

04:54:05.330 --> 04:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:54:08.030 --> 04:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
yet some elderly folks find it very
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to get out and must be
 
04:54:11.628 --> 04:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
selective about how often they ask
 
04:54:13.490 --> 04:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
family or friends to assist them in
 
04:54:15.890 --> 04:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
getting places we need to hear their
 
04:54:17.690 --> 04:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
voices and benefit from their
 
04:54:19.550 --> 04:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
accumulated experience
 
04:54:21.770 --> 04:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
for parents of young children early
 
04:54:23.868 --> 04:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
evening meetings are very inconvenient
 
04:54:26.570 --> 04:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
Child Care is expensive and often just
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
simply not available again we need to
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
hear the voices of these citizens they
 
04:54:34.010 --> 04:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
are the future of our democracy
 
04:54:36.170 --> 04:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
people with physical limitations may
 
04:54:37.970 --> 04:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
find it simply too complicated to
 
04:54:39.470 --> 04:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
participate in person
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
in my own town a young man severely
 
04:54:44.208 --> 04:54:44.218 align:start position:0%
injured by a motor vehicle accident has
 
04:54:46.550 --> 04:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
benefited from meeting on Zoom it's
 
04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
really great to hear his engagement
 
04:54:50.990 --> 04:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
finally making meetings remotely
 
04:54:52.850 --> 04:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
accessible is better for our Collective

04:54:58.128 --> 04:54:58.138 align:start position:0%
for those who might question how many
 
04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
citizens would actually watch I note
 
04:55:02.930 --> 04:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
these points when I was initially
 
04:55:04.788 --> 04:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
campaigning for State Rep in Claremont
 
04:55:07.490 --> 04:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
where I was not well known I attended a
 
04:55:09.530 --> 04:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
city council meeting and unintentionally
 
04:55:11.650 --> 04:55:11.660 align:start position:0%
chose a seat that was on camera often
 
04:55:14.990 --> 04:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
next day as I was door knocking multiple
 
04:55:17.570 --> 04:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
people told me they had met me quote see
 
04:55:20.030 --> 04:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
me or heard me the night before on Zoom
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
I decided to own that seat for future
 
04:55:22.200 --> 04:55:23.390 align:start position:0%
I decided to own that seat for future
meetings

04:55:23.390 --> 04:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:55:25.490 --> 04:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
just last evening the Croydon school
 
04:55:27.530 --> 04:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
board was scheduling a budget hearing
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
discussion of which town building would
 
04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
accommodate the expected audience
 
04:55:33.170 --> 04:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
quickly was influenced by which site was
 
04:55:35.448 --> 04:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
most feasible for Zoom as people have
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
come to expect and appreciate streaming
 
04:55:37.680 --> 04:55:38.868 align:start position:0%
come to expect and appreciate streaming
meetings

04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:55:40.490 --> 04:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
now the challenges
 
04:55:42.850 --> 04:55:42.860 align:start position:0%
I acknowledge that technology isn't free
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
Broadband isn't yet universally
 
04:55:47.930 --> 04:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
available and reliable however in most
 
04:55:49.788 --> 04:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
communities this can be done for very
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
modest costs that is appropriate for the
 
04:55:55.490 --> 04:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
values I have noted for example Cordon
 
04:55:56.810 --> 04:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't currently have adequate
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to live stream from our town
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
hall if more than a few people are on
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
their devices
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
a local Warren article asked the town to
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
install starlink at a one-time Hardware
 
04:56:09.708 --> 04:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
cost of 599 dollars with a reasonable
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
monthly fee of a hundred and ten dollars
 
04:56:14.810 --> 04:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate camera and microphones are
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
increasingly affordable a setup overall
 
04:56:19.128 --> 04:56:19.138 align:start position:0%
can be purchased for less than two
 
04:56:20.330 --> 04:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:56:23.390 --> 04:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
or as basic as one board member sets up
 
04:56:26.510 --> 04:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
a zoom on a laptop or YouTube not
 
04:56:29.390 --> 04:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
perfect quality but available affordable
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
and as noted in my Croydon example from
 
04:56:34.610 --> 04:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
last night appreciated by voters
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
there are also companies such as Town
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hall streaming who will contract to
 
04:56:41.628 --> 04:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
provide this Service Hardware is free
 
04:56:43.850 --> 04:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
with a monthly subscription fee that's
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
contingent on the number of meetings but
 
04:56:49.190 --> 04:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
in the range of 100 to 200 monthly I
 
04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
learned about town hall streaming from
 
04:56:52.610 --> 04:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
the Sunapee Town manager who indicated
 
04:56:55.010 --> 04:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
they are very pleased with the service
 
04:56:58.190 --> 04:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
and I've spoken with the New Hampshire
 
04:56:59.570 --> 04:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
proprietor I think they're a national
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
company or at least Regional and they're
 
04:57:04.730 --> 04:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
very open to more business I don't
 
04:57:05.990 --> 04:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
believe they're the only company that
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
does this but one that I can note
 
04:57:11.510 --> 04:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
in closing if we value citizen
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
participation informed voters and a fair
 
04:57:16.730 --> 04:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
Democratic process we will move forward
 
04:57:19.368 --> 04:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
House Bill 295 to improve transparency
 
04:57:21.410 --> 04:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
in local government thank you for
 
04:57:26.570 --> 04:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:30.050 --> 04:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
04:57:31.970 --> 04:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:57:31.980 --> 04:57:33.230 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
um is your intention of not having any
 
04:57:36.480 --> 04:57:38.208 align:start position:0%
um is your intention of not having any
penalties

04:57:38.208 --> 04:57:38.218 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
um associated with this to be a strong
 
04:57:44.930 --> 04:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
encouragement but not actually uh
 
04:57:48.890 --> 04:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh mandate uh from the from the state to
 
04:57:50.930 --> 04:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
the local municipalities to you know
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
spend the two thousand dollars right
 
04:57:53.690 --> 04:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
this very moment
 
04:57:56.510 --> 04:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
04:57:59.570 --> 04:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
I would really love to see this happen
 
04:58:01.610 --> 04:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
in every Community however
 
04:58:03.530 --> 04:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
I am respectful of the differences
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the state the differences in
 
04:58:06.890 --> 04:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
size of communities
 
04:58:08.690 --> 04:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
at least having it as a strong
 
04:58:10.368 --> 04:58:10.378 align:start position:0%
encouragement gets the topic on the
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:19.010 --> 04:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie thank you Mr
 
04:58:21.770 --> 04:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your hard work
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
that this must have taken and not only
 
04:58:27.230 --> 04:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
that for the transparency that this
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
would result in
 
04:58:30.770 --> 04:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
04:58:34.010 --> 04:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
do you feel it's necessary to for the
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
state to legislate what should be being
 
04:58:39.650 --> 04:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
done in communities and which each
 
04:58:42.890 --> 04:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
Community should be able to make that
 
04:58:44.690 --> 04:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
judgment based on their own financial
 
04:58:47.570 --> 04:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
situation and I have a short follow-up
 
04:58:49.788 --> 04:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
as the chairman if I could
 
04:58:52.910 --> 04:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:58:55.850 --> 04:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
I wish that there was a universal point
 
04:58:59.690 --> 04:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
of view throughout boards throughout the
 
04:58:59.700 --> 04:59:00.708 align:start position:0%
of view throughout boards throughout the
state

04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:59:02.810 --> 04:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
where everyone agreed that transparency
 
04:59:05.448 --> 04:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
in government is a good thing
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I don't think that's true
 
04:59:11.570 --> 04:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
and we have experience locally and I
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
know of other situations not in my own
 
04:59:14.878 --> 04:59:16.070 align:start position:0%
know of other situations not in my own
District

04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
District
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
where board members were very
 
04:59:21.948 --> 04:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
unwelcoming and resistant to being
 
04:59:21.958 --> 04:59:23.150 align:start position:0%
unwelcoming and resistant to being
recorded

04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
04:59:28.550 --> 04:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
never mind streamed or or made the uh
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
proceedings made available subsequently
 
04:59:33.770 --> 04:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
never mind live so I do think that the
 
04:59:36.470 --> 04:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
state needs to step in in my follow-up
 
04:59:38.390 --> 04:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I made a very short one
 
04:59:41.090 --> 04:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh would
 
04:59:43.970 --> 04:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
what does communities do that have a
 
04:59:43.980 --> 04:59:45.050 align:start position:0%
what does communities do that have a
contract

04:59:45.050 --> 04:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
contract
 
04:59:47.150 --> 04:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
with a cable
 
04:59:51.650 --> 04:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
that requires them to use Comcast or
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
infinity or whatever and the people who
 
04:59:55.798 --> 04:59:56.590 align:start position:0%
infinity or whatever and the people who
are

04:59:56.590 --> 04:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:59:58.910 --> 04:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
viewing only have
 
05:00:02.690 --> 05:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
facilities for Comcast
 
05:00:04.910 --> 05:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of us say there's some cowardly
 
05:00:06.770 --> 05:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
board how would the boards work around
 
05:00:09.288 --> 05:00:09.298 align:start position:0%
any contract limitations they might
 
05:00:11.570 --> 05:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
already have
 
05:00:13.670 --> 05:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
if I understand your correct question
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
correctly and if my answer sounds like I
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:24.170 --> 05:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
um so if a community
 
05:00:27.170 --> 05:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
is broadcasting through one company say
 
05:00:27.180 --> 05:00:28.910 align:start position:0%
is broadcasting through one company say
compass

05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
compass
 
05:00:32.270 --> 05:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
and some of the citizens don't have
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
Comcast that's what you're yes asking
 
05:00:37.810 --> 05:00:37.820 align:start position:0%
how they work around that
 
05:00:40.910 --> 05:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
05:00:40.920 --> 05:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
I don't know
um

05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
I mean at a minimum they would be able
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
to view it subsequently if it's recorded
 
05:00:49.490 --> 05:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
there would be a way to do that
 
05:00:49.500 --> 05:00:51.410 align:start position:0%
there would be a way to do that
um

05:00:51.410 --> 05:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:53.150 --> 05:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
if it's live streamed in many
 
05:00:54.530 --> 05:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
communities it's going to be connected
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
to zoom and people can access Zoom from
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
whatever their provider is or a similar
 
05:01:00.890 --> 05:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
platform to zoom go to meeting or
 
05:01:00.900 --> 05:01:02.208 align:start position:0%
platform to zoom go to meeting or
something

05:01:02.208 --> 05:01:02.218 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:01:04.970 --> 05:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
but that raises an important question I
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring up their odd some
 
05:01:08.690 --> 05:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
problems outside of
 
05:01:12.550 --> 05:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that we were legislating the
 
05:01:15.250 --> 05:01:15.260 align:start position:0%
towns and cities do this thank you
 
05:01:19.730 --> 05:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
freely I'm sorry representative Brown
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
yes I just said thanks for taking my
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh the
 
05:01:26.330 --> 05:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
question I have is why is it
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
significantly different to have it live
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
streamed as opposed to Simply recording
 
05:01:32.570 --> 05:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
and posting it on like a town web page
 
05:01:34.730 --> 05:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
which I know many towns in the state
 
05:01:37.850 --> 05:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.250 --> 05:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you I may be making an assumption
 
05:01:43.128 --> 05:01:43.138 align:start position:0%
here which is always risky
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
but I think when people see things live
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
they feel more engaged and involved than
 
05:01:50.810 --> 05:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
when they're watching the recording and
 
05:01:53.448 --> 05:01:53.458 align:start position:0%
therefore more likely to
 
05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
stay connected to it
 
05:01:58.970 --> 05:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
ideally it would in fact allow
 
05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
participation that someone would at a
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
minimum be able to type a question into
 
05:02:06.050 --> 05:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
the chat and there would be a probably
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
volunteer citizen reading the chat and
 
05:02:10.128 --> 05:02:10.138 align:start position:0%
reading off the questions we've done
 
05:02:11.270 --> 05:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
that with some of our school board
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
meetings very successfully I'm sure
 
05:02:15.410 --> 05:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
we're not the only Community to do that
 
05:02:15.420 --> 05:02:16.850 align:start position:0%
we're not the only Community to do that
um

05:02:16.850 --> 05:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:18.410 --> 05:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
recording and having it available
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
subsequently is far better than not
 
05:02:20.280 --> 05:02:21.890 align:start position:0%
subsequently is far better than not
recording

05:02:21.890 --> 05:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
recording
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:28.368 --> 05:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
05:02:30.350 --> 05:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you thank
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:02:34.850 --> 05:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
um I imagine like my town many other
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
towns probably have these meetings in
 
05:02:40.610 --> 05:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
only one or two places maybe it's at the
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
school and the town and or maybe they're
 
05:02:44.570 --> 05:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
in the same building
 
05:02:47.510 --> 05:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
why are you only including select board
 
05:02:50.990 --> 05:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
and school board and not planning budget
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
Heritage water I'm thinking of all the
 
05:02:55.850 --> 05:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
commissions that we all serve on if it's
 
05:03:00.050 --> 05:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:02.208 --> 05:03:02.218 align:start position:0%
so I think there's two-part answer to
 
05:03:02.218 --> 05:03:02.990 align:start position:0%
so I think there's two-part answer to
that

05:03:02.990 --> 05:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:07.128 --> 05:03:07.138 align:start position:0%
not all communities is it in one place
 
05:03:07.138 --> 05:03:07.788 align:start position:0%
not all communities is it in one place
um

05:03:07.788 --> 05:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
but perhaps there's there's certainly
 
05:03:13.250 --> 05:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
limits I mean a couple or three
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
to be honest when the bill was
 
05:03:17.208 --> 05:03:17.218 align:start position:0%
originally discussed among constituents
 
05:03:19.190 --> 05:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
and I there are constituents here who
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
will speak to it
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
the intent in fact was to require for
 
05:03:23.280 --> 05:03:24.410 align:start position:0%
the intent in fact was to require for
all

05:03:24.410 --> 05:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:03:27.890 --> 05:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh Community public organizations you
 
05:03:30.170 --> 05:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
know governmental organizations
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
and we edited it to attempt to be more
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
successful at getting it started
 
05:03:37.490 --> 05:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
I'd love to see planning and zoning
 
05:03:44.990 --> 05:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative Holland
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
so I I see the I I assume what you're
 
05:03:51.650 --> 05:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
saying is you want more transparency and
 
05:03:53.690 --> 05:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
that's why you want the live streaming
 
05:03:56.510 --> 05:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
and the recorded what happens if both
 
05:03:58.610 --> 05:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
fail would you suggest that the meeting
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
be rescheduled or with the minutes for
 
05:04:04.010 --> 05:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
the meeting be sufficient
 
05:04:05.930 --> 05:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I
 
05:04:08.150 --> 05:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
anticipated that
 
05:04:09.890 --> 05:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
um I think in the regulations for the
 
05:04:11.390 --> 05:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
bill there actually should be a clause
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
that says in the event of
 
05:04:16.190 --> 05:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know either a few specific like
 
05:04:19.368 --> 05:04:19.378 align:start position:0%
Broadband failure or
 
05:04:22.250 --> 05:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
not looking for excuses but
 
05:04:25.550 --> 05:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
it loss of power yes thank you
 
05:04:27.530 --> 05:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
um that it would just need to be noted
 
05:04:28.970 --> 05:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
in the minutes of the meeting why it was
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
not recorded and streamed
 
05:04:33.650 --> 05:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
um I mean human error happens too and
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to make
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
penalties and make it so difficult for
 
05:04:40.970 --> 05:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
people that we put hurdles in the way
 
05:04:41.930 --> 05:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to help people
 
05:04:47.510 --> 05:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Damon for your
 
05:04:50.160 --> 05:04:51.530 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Damon for your
testimony

05:04:51.530 --> 05:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:57.770 --> 05:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh next we'll call nature Grace from the
 
05:04:57.780 --> 05:05:03.948 align:start position:0%
uh next we'll call nature Grace from the
HMA

05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:06.050 --> 05:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Nate Grace from the
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
05:05:10.850 --> 05:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
we do oppose this bill
 
05:05:13.368 --> 05:05:13.378 align:start position:0%
um in doing some Outreach when I saw
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
this bill on the calendar last week I
 
05:05:17.030 --> 05:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
reached out to the town of Grafton and
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
the town of Easton one of the select
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
board members from Easton is here today
 
05:05:22.610 --> 05:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
to testify in opposition so I won't
 
05:05:24.890 --> 05:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
speak about them I don't believe anyone
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
from Grafton is here today unless I miss
 
05:05:28.970 --> 05:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
them behind me
 
05:05:30.770 --> 05:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
um there were practical concerns with
 
05:05:33.590 --> 05:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
this bill regardless of the policy so in
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
the town of Grafton there's no internet
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
where they have the select board
 
05:05:40.930 --> 05:05:40.940 align:start position:0%
meetings I've spoken with a
 
05:05:44.270 --> 05:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh a representative since that time
 
05:05:47.448 --> 05:05:47.458 align:start position:0%
um in in the legislature who
 
05:05:49.550 --> 05:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
apparently has good cell service uh
 
05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
where he lives but he is fortunate
 
05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and so he has a combination of
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
starlink which he doesn't use for caucus
 
05:05:57.480 --> 05:05:58.850 align:start position:0%
starlink which he doesn't use for caucus
meetings

05:05:58.850 --> 05:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
um or other important uh online meetings
 
05:06:05.090 --> 05:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
because he has seen that it has an issue
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
with pausing with stuttering because of
 
05:06:09.770 --> 05:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
course it uploads to satellites and back
 
05:06:13.070 --> 05:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
down so he couldn't guarantee that he'd
 
05:06:14.750 --> 05:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
not miss things or that people on the
 
05:06:16.850 --> 05:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
other side would miss things
 
05:06:20.750 --> 05:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and has to use uh because of where he
 
05:06:22.910 --> 05:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
is in town he can actually use a Verizon
 
05:06:24.890 --> 05:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
data pack but that's not available
 
05:06:27.948 --> 05:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
throughout the town of Crafton
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's I think just one
 
05:06:33.530 --> 05:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
illustration of a number of issues that
 
05:06:35.330 --> 05:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
communities are going to face simply
 
05:06:37.550 --> 05:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
because they don't currently have this
 
05:06:37.560 --> 05:06:39.170 align:start position:0%
because they don't currently have this
capability

05:06:39.170 --> 05:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
capability
 
05:06:41.208 --> 05:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
um I know it's not before you today but
 
05:06:43.550 --> 05:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
I know that many of you were involved in
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
discussions about remote meetings in
 
05:06:47.030 --> 05:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
previous legislation and one of the
 
05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that the legislature had was
 
05:06:52.010 --> 05:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
the ability to actually
 
05:06:55.250 --> 05:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
have those and have access to them
 
05:06:56.990 --> 05:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
because that's the intent here is to try
 
05:06:58.448 --> 05:06:58.458 align:start position:0%
to get access
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
Broadband is being built out across the
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
state there's a I don't remember exactly
 
05:07:06.530 --> 05:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
how many year plan I think it's three or
 
05:07:09.230 --> 05:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
four year plan it may be appropriate at
 
05:07:10.610 --> 05:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
that time to
 
05:07:12.770 --> 05:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
revisit the idea of how to encourage
 
05:07:15.050 --> 05:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
this type of of
 
05:07:15.060 --> 05:07:16.070 align:start position:0%
this type of of
um

05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:18.650 --> 05:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
opening up government activity to
 
05:07:22.010 --> 05:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
members of the public but at this time I
 
05:07:24.288 --> 05:07:24.298 align:start position:0%
think that it's it's premature because
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
we simply don't have
 
05:07:29.150 --> 05:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
Broadband stable internet Broadband
 
05:07:31.850 --> 05:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
access at every town hall throughout the
 
05:07:34.850 --> 05:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
state and that's really what we need and
 
05:07:36.350 --> 05:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions that
 
05:07:38.448 --> 05:07:38.458 align:start position:0%
the community may have
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very testimony representative
 
05:07:40.320 --> 05:07:42.708 align:start position:0%
thank you very testimony representative
stabis

05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
stabis
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
05:07:46.850 --> 05:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
Graves for taking my question
 
05:07:51.230 --> 05:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
um does nhma think that because some
 
05:07:55.368 --> 05:07:55.378 align:start position:0%
towns lack specific infrastructure that
 
05:07:59.090 --> 05:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
this bill might not this bill
 
05:07:59.100 --> 05:07:59.890 align:start position:0%
this bill might not this bill
um

05:07:59.890 --> 05:07:59.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:03.050 --> 05:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
facilitate the adoption of more such
 
05:08:06.650 --> 05:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
technology and isn't it also true that
 
05:08:09.410 --> 05:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
technology is getting so rapidly to the
 
05:08:12.650 --> 05:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
point where just everyone everywhere has
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
access to it
 
05:08:17.810 --> 05:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
why would nhma want to hold up a
 
05:08:17.820 --> 05:08:19.150 align:start position:0%
why would nhma want to hold up a
potentially

05:08:19.150 --> 05:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
positive development because a few towns
 
05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't have internet access
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
it isn't one thing so we represent all
 
05:08:31.850 --> 05:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
234 cities and towns and so we have to
 
05:08:34.250 --> 05:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
be conscious the fact that some of our
 
05:08:37.250 --> 05:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
members simply don't have the type of
 
05:08:39.650 --> 05:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at this point in time we
 
05:08:41.930 --> 05:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
have been working diligently to get more
 
05:08:43.610 --> 05:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
funding for Broadband infrastructure
 
05:08:45.948 --> 05:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
that's something we've been advocating
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
for for several years now we've
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
partnered with many of you on that that
 
05:08:52.250 --> 05:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
is getting built out slowly
 
05:08:54.170 --> 05:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
simply because there aren't enough
 
05:08:55.750 --> 05:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
people to build it out
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
and we are hopeful that that will happen
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the next few years and we'll have
 
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
better access throughout the state it's
 
05:09:04.368 --> 05:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
been something that has
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
um impaired our ability to grow our
 
05:09:10.070 --> 05:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
economy and it is something that we are
 
05:09:12.288 --> 05:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
very much aware that our members want
 
05:09:15.170 --> 05:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
and we are advocating for so it's a
 
05:09:17.390 --> 05:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
little premature to discuss it at this
 
05:09:17.400 --> 05:09:20.208 align:start position:0%
little premature to discuss it at this
time

05:09:20.208 --> 05:09:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:22.250 --> 05:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative Edward
 
05:09:25.368 --> 05:09:25.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good afternoon Mr
 
05:09:28.850 --> 05:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
Grace good afternoon can you tell me how
 
05:09:32.930 --> 05:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
many of the 234 cities and towns are
 
05:09:32.940 --> 05:09:33.970 align:start position:0%
many of the 234 cities and towns are
without

05:09:33.970 --> 05:09:33.980 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:09:37.368 --> 05:09:37.378 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at this time
 
05:09:40.010 --> 05:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know off the top of my head
 
05:09:40.020 --> 05:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
I don't know off the top of my head
um

05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
I do know that it's mainly the more
 
05:09:44.690 --> 05:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
rural communities in the North Country
 
05:09:48.350 --> 05:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
meaning kawas county Grafton County
 
05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
um and then I believe Belknap and um
 
05:09:54.170 --> 05:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
to some extent
 
05:09:54.180 --> 05:09:55.250 align:start position:0%
to some extent
um

05:09:55.250 --> 05:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:57.530 --> 05:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
nearer the Seacoast but that's that's
 
05:10:00.708 --> 05:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
pretty well served Stratford county is
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
what I mean Rockingham County is well
 
05:10:04.970 --> 05:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
served Hillsborough County is well
 
05:10:04.980 --> 05:10:06.128 align:start position:0%
served Hillsborough County is well
served

05:10:06.128 --> 05:10:06.138 align:start position:0%
served
 
05:10:08.570 --> 05:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
much of
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
um Merrimack County as well served there
 
05:10:12.770 --> 05:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
are some Pockets that don't have quite
 
05:10:15.650 --> 05:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
the same but there are some like for
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
example the town of Bradford I call them
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
and they'd actually just seen a fiber
 
05:10:21.770 --> 05:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
fiber Line run out there about three
 
05:10:23.448 --> 05:10:23.458 align:start position:0%
months ago so they actually have very
 
05:10:24.890 --> 05:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
high speed internet at the moment they
 
05:10:26.570 --> 05:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
are broadcasting their select board
 
05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
meetings and certainly we have been
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
encouraging members to do that because
 
05:10:33.288 --> 05:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
we saw the increased participation you
 
05:10:35.090 --> 05:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
heard the sponsor talk about quick
 
05:10:38.628 --> 05:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up sir follow-up
 
05:10:43.430 --> 05:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how many of your members
 
05:10:46.610 --> 05:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
cities and towns have websites Town
 
05:10:46.620 --> 05:10:51.410 align:start position:0%
cities and towns have websites Town
websites

05:10:51.410 --> 05:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
I believe most of them do okay
 
05:10:59.930 --> 05:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:59.940 --> 05:11:02.448 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

05:11:02.448 --> 05:11:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:04.610 --> 05:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:11:08.208 --> 05:11:08.218 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Grace for taking my
 
05:11:08.218 --> 05:11:10.190 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Grace for taking my
question

05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:11:10.200 --> 05:11:11.628 align:start position:0%
question
if

05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
only few handful of
 
05:11:14.400 --> 05:11:16.570 align:start position:0%
only few handful of
uh

05:11:16.570 --> 05:11:16.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:11:21.490 --> 05:11:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't you think it would be good to
 
05:11:27.770 --> 05:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
implement something and they adopt it
 
05:11:30.410 --> 05:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
because this is a good practice rather
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:36.948 --> 05:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
I I would say that if the state would
 
05:11:39.410 --> 05:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
like to pay to run a line out to the
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
town hall and Grafton and Easton and the
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
other places that are underserved we
 
05:11:46.970 --> 05:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
certainly would encourage that we don't
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
currently have that ability I don't know
 
05:11:50.690 --> 05:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
of any bill on the table that would
 
05:11:53.628 --> 05:11:53.638 align:start position:0%
offer that I do know that towns are
 
05:11:55.128 --> 05:11:55.138 align:start position:0%
working through the Broadband Grant
 
05:11:57.288 --> 05:11:57.298 align:start position:0%
programs of which there are several we
 
05:11:59.810 --> 05:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
are assisting them with that but we're
 
05:11:59.820 --> 05:12:01.070 align:start position:0%
are assisting them with that but we're
not

05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
we haven't built out to the extent yet
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
where every town is served
 
05:12:09.288 --> 05:12:09.298 align:start position:0%
a follow-up Mr chair just a quick uh
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
we'll come back representative
 
05:12:14.690 --> 05:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
question you seem to be focused mostly
 
05:12:18.890 --> 05:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
on your testimony about the live
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
streaming portion
 
05:12:22.190 --> 05:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
um if
 
05:12:26.570 --> 05:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
that can you speak to just having a
 
05:12:30.288 --> 05:12:30.298 align:start position:0%
requirement of the video of of of uh
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
video recordings and if uh live
 
05:12:36.650 --> 05:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
streaming is not an option if if uh
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
video recording is something amenable
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
so I haven't previously considered that
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
I'd have to get back to you uh about it
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:12:50.930 --> 05:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
I guess just as a practical matter
 
05:12:52.730 --> 05:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
we generally oppose things that would
 
05:12:55.610 --> 05:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
impose new costs on municipalities and
 
05:12:55.620 --> 05:12:56.930 align:start position:0%
impose new costs on municipalities and
so

05:12:56.930 --> 05:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:58.730 --> 05:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
um requiring them to purchase new
 
05:13:01.490 --> 05:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
equipment they may not have and would
 
05:13:03.770 --> 05:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
not be expected to have because they
 
05:13:06.650 --> 05:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
don't have that type of Technology out
 
05:13:09.650 --> 05:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
there or that technological service at
 
05:13:10.670 --> 05:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
05:13:10.680 --> 05:13:11.448 align:start position:0%
the moment
um

05:13:11.448 --> 05:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
is possible as well
 
05:13:16.910 --> 05:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I would I guess
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
sorry the other thing I'd like to also
 
05:13:22.610 --> 05:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
raise in that context is
 
05:13:24.590 --> 05:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
the question of technological failure
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
and what exactly to do that wasn't
 
05:13:28.368 --> 05:13:28.378 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill I know that the
 
05:13:30.530 --> 05:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned that she would be
 
05:13:34.190 --> 05:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
interested in in looking at that as well
 
05:13:36.110 --> 05:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
05:13:38.090 --> 05:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I I think this
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question Mr
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
Graves I think this might be an add-on
 
05:13:45.288 --> 05:13:45.298 align:start position:0%
to what you just said does this then
 
05:13:48.050 --> 05:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
create an unfunded mandate and and then
 
05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
create a violation of 28a I think that's
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
a distinct possibility yes thank you
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative manager put he had
 
05:13:59.330 --> 05:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
another question uh thank you if this is
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
an opt-in
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
those that have the capability do it and
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
those that don't have are not going to
 
05:14:09.530 --> 05:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
be penalized would that make it
 
05:14:14.330 --> 05:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
a more move forward kind of uh
 
05:14:16.910 --> 05:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
so I think we have to be careful when we
 
05:14:18.770 --> 05:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
pull different policy levers and I think
 
05:14:21.170 --> 05:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
if we were to have an opt-in that would
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
require additional costs you might see
 
05:14:27.110 --> 05:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
places that don't have these
 
05:14:30.050 --> 05:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
Technologies not want to opt in they
 
05:14:31.550 --> 05:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
might not want to allocate that a town
 
05:14:34.730 --> 05:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
meeting their voters might vote it down
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
um certainly we would like to encourage
 
05:14:39.948 --> 05:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities and we certainly have a
 
05:14:42.288 --> 05:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
policy position to
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
go towards open government and to
 
05:14:46.670 --> 05:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
promote that so we would like to
 
05:14:49.490 --> 05:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
encourage that kind of voluntary
 
05:14:49.500 --> 05:14:50.030 align:start position:0%
encourage that kind of voluntary
um

05:14:50.030 --> 05:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:52.670 --> 05:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary work but we we don't want to
 
05:14:54.590 --> 05:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do anything that might
 
05:14:58.070 --> 05:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
upset the apple cart
 
05:14:58.080 --> 05:15:06.590 align:start position:0%
upset the apple cart
foreign

05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:08.930 --> 05:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for for uh
 
05:15:10.670 --> 05:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
05:15:16.490 --> 05:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
um if someone put uh a Warren article if
 
05:15:19.550 --> 05:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
if this was enabling saying that if
 
05:15:21.288 --> 05:15:21.298 align:start position:0%
someone put in a Warren article that
 
05:15:26.090 --> 05:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
says that the uh townshall do this
 
05:15:29.448 --> 05:15:29.458 align:start position:0%
um and appropriated some money to some
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
taxation money
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
um under the current law is your
 
05:15:35.868 --> 05:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
understanding that the selectman could
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
choose to not actually purchase that in
 
05:15:41.530 --> 05:15:41.540 align:start position:0%
for uh stuff
 
05:15:45.470 --> 05:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh correct even though it was it was
 
05:15:48.530 --> 05:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
passed by the town asking them to do so
 
05:15:50.690 --> 05:15:50.700 align:start position:0%
right so if there was a petition worn
 
05:15:52.550 --> 05:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
article that
 
05:15:54.530 --> 05:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
um allocated money raised and
 
05:15:55.788 --> 05:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
appropriated money for the purpose of
 
05:15:57.770 --> 05:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
purchasing this equipment right and it
 
05:15:59.570 --> 05:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
it passed
 
05:16:01.610 --> 05:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
um that would authorize the select board
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
to do that they wouldn't necessarily be
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
required to do it much like the case
 
05:16:08.868 --> 05:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
with you know a warrant article for a
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
new snow plow
 
05:16:10.560 --> 05:16:11.270 align:start position:0%
new snow plow
um

05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:14.448 --> 05:16:14.458 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to safeguard the uh
 
05:16:16.368 --> 05:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
Financial interests of the town and make
 
05:16:19.610 --> 05:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
prudent decisions so they may not but
 
05:16:21.770 --> 05:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
obviously everyone who works in local
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
politics know that if something passes
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
especially if it's with a big majority
 
05:16:29.810 --> 05:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
that there's a large interest at the
 
05:16:31.850 --> 05:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
local level of that happening so I'm
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
certain that they would work towards
 
05:16:39.470 --> 05:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions I have one
 
05:16:42.590 --> 05:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
brief one
 
05:16:42.600 --> 05:16:43.368 align:start position:0%
brief one
um

05:16:43.368 --> 05:16:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
based on a lot of the talk about opting
 
05:16:49.490 --> 05:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
in and warrant articles and all this
 
05:16:51.410 --> 05:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding that right now
 
05:16:52.910 --> 05:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
there would be nothing that would
 
05:16:56.628 --> 05:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
prevent a town from recording live
 
05:16:59.570 --> 05:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
broadcasting live streaming if they so
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
so chose to do correct there's nothing
 
05:17:03.770 --> 05:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
preventing them from doing any of this
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
at the moment thank you
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
um a lot of what I uh what I have to say
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
will Echo
 
05:17:28.190 --> 05:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
what hope has said
 
05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
um but if you'll give me two minutes
 
05:17:32.270 --> 05:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap it up quick and you guys can
 
05:17:34.190 --> 05:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
do what you do
 
05:17:35.510 --> 05:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
um hello good afternoon my name is
 
05:17:37.368 --> 05:17:37.378 align:start position:0%
Edward Spiker I'm a resident of Croydon
 
05:17:39.050 --> 05:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire co-chair of stand up for
 
05:17:41.690 --> 05:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
Croydon uh civil advocacy group that
 
05:17:43.368 --> 05:17:43.378 align:start position:0%
promotes robust nonpartisan Civic
 
05:17:45.350 --> 05:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
engagement and an active member of my
 
05:17:47.330 --> 05:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
community first I'd like to thank you
 
05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
all for having us here today and
 
05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
allowing us a few moments to convey our
 
05:17:52.570 --> 05:17:52.580 align:start position:0%
thoughts and opinions on House Bill
 
05:17:56.510 --> 05:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
295--fm and others myself and many other
 
05:17:58.010 --> 05:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
residents of this great state fully
 
05:18:00.708 --> 05:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
support HB 295 FN for a Litany of
 
05:18:02.208 --> 05:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
reasons a few of which I'd be happy to
 
05:18:04.850 --> 05:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
shed some light on today House Bill 295
 
05:18:07.250 --> 05:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
FN a bill which would require all all
 
05:18:08.690 --> 05:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
public select board and school board
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
meetings to be recorded and broadcast
 
05:18:12.890 --> 05:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
live online is not only a step in the
 
05:18:14.510 --> 05:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
right direction it may be the only
 
05:18:16.730 --> 05:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity for some residents to become
 
05:18:18.770 --> 05:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
informed and feel as though their voice
 
05:18:21.770 --> 05:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
is heard and that their opinions matter
 
05:18:23.930 --> 05:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh coming from a town where a select
 
05:18:26.030 --> 05:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
board does not provide remote access to
 
05:18:28.128 --> 05:18:28.138 align:start position:0%
or record meetings to make available for
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
later viewing makes one appreciated so
 
05:18:31.850 --> 05:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
much more when other boards care enough
 
05:18:34.310 --> 05:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
to do so take for example those with
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
severe physical limitations who can't
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
make it to a meeting in person do their
 
05:18:39.948 --> 05:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
thoughts and opinions on matters of the
 
05:18:41.510 --> 05:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
public matter any less than the person
 
05:18:42.890 --> 05:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
05:18:44.990 --> 05:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to think not
 
05:18:46.970 --> 05:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
there's also a vast number of elderly
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
residents in the state that are unable
 
05:18:50.930 --> 05:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
to make it to some meetings in person
 
05:18:53.448 --> 05:18:53.458 align:start position:0%
due to time of day inclement weather or
 
05:18:55.610 --> 05:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
for health related reasons this bill
 
05:18:57.288 --> 05:18:57.298 align:start position:0%
would allow them to be involved and
 
05:18:59.090 --> 05:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
remain informed about town happenings
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
that matter to them it also creates
 
05:19:03.170 --> 05:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
opportunities for towns to benefit from
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
the knowledge and experience of our
 
05:19:06.350 --> 05:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
senior citizens
 
05:19:08.090 --> 05:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
as someone that has been unable to
 
05:19:10.128 --> 05:19:10.138 align:start position:0%
attend meetings in the past I've seen
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
what can happen when people are
 
05:19:13.670 --> 05:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
uninformed last March I took it upon
 
05:19:15.948 --> 05:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
myself to begin recording and live
 
05:19:18.590 --> 05:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
broadcasting all town and public all
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
public town and school meetings in
 
05:19:22.430 --> 05:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
Croydon since no one else on the board
 
05:19:24.948 --> 05:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
seemed to want to do that
 
05:19:26.930 --> 05:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
I was unaware that I would receive such
 
05:19:28.850 --> 05:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
an outcry of support from residents of
 
05:19:31.490 --> 05:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
town just for making access possible I
 
05:19:33.650 --> 05:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
was also unaware unaware of the amount
 
05:19:35.448 --> 05:19:35.458 align:start position:0%
of voluntary work that I had signed on
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
for and how many meetings that I would
 
05:19:39.770 --> 05:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
be regularly attending this bill would
 
05:19:41.570 --> 05:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
serve to take the responsibility of
 
05:19:43.368 --> 05:19:43.378 align:start position:0%
providing remote access off of the
 
05:19:45.650 --> 05:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
shoulders of the public and put it on
 
05:19:48.050 --> 05:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
the boards to offer transparency and
 
05:19:49.550 --> 05:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
accountability to the people that they
 
05:19:52.010 --> 05:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
represent for these reasons and more I
 
05:19:53.570 --> 05:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
believe that the pros greatly outweigh
 
05:19:56.090 --> 05:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
any cons that could arise and I implore
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
you to support and put forth into law HB
 
05:20:00.530 --> 05:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
295 FN thank you for your time and
 
05:20:02.690 --> 05:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
consideration and I'd happily take any
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
questions you have
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative yocella
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you can you
 
05:20:10.200 --> 05:20:11.390 align:start position:0%
thank you can you
um

05:20:11.390 --> 05:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:14.690 --> 05:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
kind of go into some some detail on your
 
05:20:17.270 --> 05:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts about the value of of the
 
05:20:17.280 --> 05:20:18.830 align:start position:0%
thoughts about the value of of the
recorded

05:20:18.830 --> 05:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
05:20:22.970 --> 05:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
um entire uh meeting versus just a
 
05:20:26.930 --> 05:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
summary of minutes that may not be as
 
05:20:29.868 --> 05:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
detailed absolutely great question
 
05:20:31.970 --> 05:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
um minutes are great but minutes are
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
usually provided by one of the board
 
05:20:37.070 --> 05:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
members that are there and they can
 
05:20:39.650 --> 05:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
include what the board members choose to
 
05:20:42.368 --> 05:20:42.378 align:start position:0%
include a lot of times
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
a audio and video documentary
 
05:20:48.708 --> 05:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
of what happens in that meeting
 
05:20:51.830 --> 05:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
offers far more insight to what happened
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
during that meeting than
 
05:20:57.288 --> 05:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
10 sentences on a piece of paper Ken
 
05:20:57.298 --> 05:20:58.730 align:start position:0%
10 sentences on a piece of paper Ken
anytime

05:20:58.730 --> 05:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the folks in Croydon
 
05:21:01.440 --> 05:21:02.750 align:start position:0%
and the folks in Croydon
um

05:21:02.750 --> 05:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:04.610 --> 05:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
the folks in Croydon greatly appreciate
 
05:21:07.730 --> 05:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
it the act just being able to access the
 
05:21:07.740 --> 05:21:08.510 align:start position:0%
it the act just being able to access the
video

05:21:08.510 --> 05:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
video
 
05:21:11.868 --> 05:21:11.878 align:start position:0%
let alone being able to see it in real
 
05:21:16.430 --> 05:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:21.948 --> 05:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:24.650 --> 05:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:21:27.410 --> 05:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question
 
05:21:27.420 --> 05:21:28.430 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question
um

05:21:28.430 --> 05:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
in in your town you don't have any local
 
05:21:35.810 --> 05:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
closer TV access or anything right
 
05:21:37.970 --> 05:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
there's no closed circuit TV uh the
 
05:21:39.470 --> 05:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
neighboring Town
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
um Newport has a great closed circuit
 
05:21:44.930 --> 05:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
television setup
 
05:21:46.850 --> 05:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
um every town meeting every school board
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
meeting planning board select board
 
05:21:51.410 --> 05:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
zoning board they're all accounted for
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
our town has none of that
 
05:21:53.700 --> 05:21:54.610 align:start position:0%
our town has none of that
um

05:21:54.610 --> 05:21:54.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
bandwidth at Town Hall is
 
05:21:57.840 --> 05:21:59.448 align:start position:0%
bandwidth at Town Hall is
Limited

05:21:59.448 --> 05:21:59.458 align:start position:0%
Limited
 
05:22:02.030 --> 05:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
but that's that's all able to be changed
 
05:22:05.810 --> 05:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
and it should be changed in order to get
 
05:22:10.490 --> 05:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:13.730 --> 05:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
I mean when when I thank you nope when I
 
05:22:15.770 --> 05:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
started doing it
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
it was because of a school board related
 
05:22:18.000 --> 05:22:18.948 align:start position:0%
it was because of a school board related
issue

05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
a year ago
 
05:22:23.570 --> 05:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
and the majority of the town was
 
05:22:26.570 --> 05:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
uninformed as to what was happening are
 
05:22:29.270 --> 05:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
you speaking exactly to now the bill are
 
05:22:29.280 --> 05:22:30.110 align:start position:0%
you speaking exactly to now the bill are
you

05:22:30.110 --> 05:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:22:32.448 --> 05:22:32.458 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to the only reason I asked
 
05:22:35.090 --> 05:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
is we are way behind and we're trying to
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
if you're speaking directly to the bill
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to the service that the
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
bill would provide to others go ahead
 
05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
as of last March
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
more towns uh sorry excuse me
 
05:22:51.530 --> 05:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
residents of the town have become far
 
05:22:53.690 --> 05:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
more involved in
 
05:22:58.250 --> 05:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
all aspects of town governance all of it
 
05:23:00.590 --> 05:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
it will boost interest
 
05:23:04.610 --> 05:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
in positions in town it will provide
 
05:23:07.788 --> 05:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
a means for folks to be heard who cannot
 
05:23:11.150 --> 05:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
be in attendance at those meetings
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it's invaluable
 
05:23:16.730 --> 05:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your tests
 
05:23:18.288 --> 05:23:18.298 align:start position:0%
timoni did you have a question
 
05:23:22.128 --> 05:23:22.138 align:start position:0%
representative priest silk no okay
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative lasalles
 
05:23:28.070 --> 05:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know very quickly uh is it your
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
opinion in Croydon the problem with
 
05:23:36.350 --> 05:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
doing this is one of technology or is it
 
05:23:39.650 --> 05:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
attitude on the part of town fathers
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
it would be a combination of the two
 
05:23:42.240 --> 05:23:42.850 align:start position:0%
it would be a combination of the two
um

05:23:42.850 --> 05:23:42.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:49.010 --> 05:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
lack of bandwidth is a fixable problem
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
but the lack of ambition
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
to want to provide information to your
 
05:23:58.190 --> 05:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
townsfolk can be a problem on all boards
 
05:24:01.730 --> 05:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
and lack of transparency is an issue in
 
05:24:03.170 --> 05:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
Croydon and
 
05:24:03.180 --> 05:24:05.090 align:start position:0%
Croydon and
Statewide

05:24:05.090 --> 05:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
05:24:07.368 --> 05:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
thank you and I compliment you on taking
 
05:24:09.288 --> 05:24:09.298 align:start position:0%
the initiative to do what you're doing
 
05:24:12.550 --> 05:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.690 --> 05:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you for
 
05:24:16.670 --> 05:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you very much you
 
05:24:17.868 --> 05:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen have a great day
 
05:24:30.490 --> 05:24:30.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:33.530 --> 05:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon uh Mr chairman
 
05:24:35.570 --> 05:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
Zach May and I'm here representing the
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
select Board of the Hamlet of Easton or
 
05:24:42.530 --> 05:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
a town of 275 ish
 
05:24:46.850 --> 05:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
with the town budget of uh 230 000. we
 
05:24:49.010 --> 05:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill on two fronts one we
 
05:24:51.288 --> 05:24:51.298 align:start position:0%
have no high-speed internet service at
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
the town that would sup in at the Town
 
05:24:56.090 --> 05:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
Hall that would support video live
 
05:24:56.100 --> 05:24:57.288 align:start position:0%
Hall that would support video live
streaming

05:24:57.288 --> 05:24:57.298 align:start position:0%
streaming
 
05:24:59.448 --> 05:24:59.458 align:start position:0%
and two the technical and Personnel
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
costs to set up and maintain such a
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
systems and honest unnecessary expense
 
05:25:05.690 --> 05:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
and disproportionately and it
 
05:25:08.930 --> 05:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
disproportionate for a town of our size
 
05:25:10.970 --> 05:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh especially given that the general
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
public is already allowed to record and
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
live stream
 
05:25:18.650 --> 05:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
themselves I think it should be up to
 
05:25:21.050 --> 05:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
each municipality to decide
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
choose whether to adopt
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
Town sponsored live streaming
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%

05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
previous question about what if it was

just recording and not live streaming
 
05:25:42.650 --> 05:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
since it is talked about
 
05:25:44.810 --> 05:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
um and live streaming what if that was
 
05:25:46.670 --> 05:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
just struck and it was just recording do
 
05:25:49.010 --> 05:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
you think that that is
 
05:25:51.708 --> 05:25:51.718 align:start position:0%

05:25:55.730 --> 05:25:55.740 align:start position:0%

transparency in local government
 
05:28:06.110 --> 05:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
as much as some of our constituents
 
05:28:07.970 --> 05:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
might want to attend meetings of their
 
05:28:09.708 --> 05:28:09.718 align:start position:0%
local elected officials they cannot
 
05:28:12.890 --> 05:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
always manage to do so they might be ill
 
05:28:15.530 --> 05:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
have mobility issues have no
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%

after a day at work to go out HB 295
 
05:28:33.650 --> 05:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
allows them to observe and participate
 
05:28:36.770 --> 05:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
18 years ago I was hiring for an
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant position at
 
05:28:38.878 --> 05:28:39.770 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant position at
Dartmouth

05:28:39.770 --> 05:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth
 
05:28:41.628 --> 05:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
one of the candidates I interviewed was
 
05:28:44.270 --> 05:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
in Birmingham Alabama in order to
 
05:28:46.490 --> 05:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
interview this person by video they had
 
05:28:49.010 --> 05:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
to go to a studio in Birmingham and I
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
had to go to a studio on the Dartmouth
 
05:28:50.638 --> 05:28:51.770 align:start position:0%
had to go to a studio on the Dartmouth
campus

05:28:51.770 --> 05:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
campus
 
05:28:54.890 --> 05:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
we have come a long way since then now
 
05:28:56.570 --> 05:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
access to live streaming is near
 
05:28:56.580 --> 05:28:58.128 align:start position:0%
access to live streaming is near
ubiquitous

05:28:58.128 --> 05:28:58.138 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous
 
05:29:00.890 --> 05:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
I would suggest two friendly amendments
 
05:29:02.570 --> 05:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
to the bill is written
 
05:29:04.850 --> 05:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
first the bill specifically mentions
 
05:29:07.550 --> 05:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
select boards and school boards as I
 
05:29:09.350 --> 05:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned I live in Lebanon which is a
 
05:29:09.360 --> 05:29:10.128 align:start position:0%
mentioned I live in Lebanon which is a
city

05:29:10.128 --> 05:29:10.138 align:start position:0%
city
 
05:29:12.350 --> 05:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
we have a city council rather than a
 
05:29:14.570 --> 05:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
select board perhaps the bill could
 
05:29:16.490 --> 05:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
apply to meetings of all elected
 
05:29:19.070 --> 05:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal bodies which would Encompass
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
select boards City councils Boards of
 
05:29:23.628 --> 05:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
aldermen and school boards
 
05:29:25.788 --> 05:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
second and this is pretty relevant to
 
05:29:27.770 --> 05:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
what we've been hearing because there
 
05:29:29.448 --> 05:29:29.458 align:start position:0%
might be communities with insufficient
 
05:29:31.368 --> 05:29:31.378 align:start position:0%
Broadband capability perhaps the bill
 
05:29:33.170 --> 05:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
could contain language that it pertains
 
05:29:35.690 --> 05:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
to municipalities with sufficient
 
05:29:37.250 --> 05:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
Broadband to support live stream
 
05:29:37.260 --> 05:29:38.990 align:start position:0%
Broadband to support live stream
meetings

05:29:38.990 --> 05:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:47.570 --> 05:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%

05:34:25.730 --> 05:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative from Rockingham District
 
05:34:28.570 --> 05:34:28.580 align:start position:0%
31 that covers the towns of Deerfield
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
Auburn Candia and
 
05:34:37.310 --> 05:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
Chester this bill would
 
05:34:39.650 --> 05:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
limit the membership of the municipal
 
05:34:41.330 --> 05:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
05:34:43.430 --> 05:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to the
 
05:34:43.440 --> 05:34:44.330 align:start position:0%
with regard to the
um

05:34:44.330 --> 05:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:46.310 --> 05:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
select board member and the school board
 
05:34:49.490 --> 05:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
member it would keep them as members
 
05:34:51.530 --> 05:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
ex-officio they would not be able to
 
05:34:53.690 --> 05:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
vote on the budget
 
05:34:55.368 --> 05:34:55.378 align:start position:0%
having served on a municipal budget
 
05:34:57.830 --> 05:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee for several years now what
 
05:35:00.230 --> 05:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
I've noticed is that
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
the deck is stacked against the
 
05:35:04.670 --> 05:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the way this is set up the
 
05:35:06.830 --> 05:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
municipal budget committee
 
05:35:08.990 --> 05:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
scheme was set up to give the taxpayers
 
05:35:10.730 --> 05:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
a Fail-Safe
 
05:35:12.830 --> 05:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
one more set of eyes to comb through the
 
05:35:14.330 --> 05:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
budget and look for savings on their
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
behalf after the two bodies governing
 
05:35:19.190 --> 05:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
bodies had finished their work
 
05:35:21.470 --> 05:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
the way it is now
 
05:35:24.410 --> 05:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
there's already two votes in favor of
 
05:35:25.970 --> 05:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
those budgets before the budget
 
05:35:27.590 --> 05:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
committees even get a chance to look at
 
05:35:30.288 --> 05:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
them that would be akin to the governor
 
05:35:31.970 --> 05:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
picking his two of his own executive
 
05:35:31.980 --> 05:35:33.890 align:start position:0%
picking his two of his own executive
counselors

05:35:33.890 --> 05:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
05:35:35.890 --> 05:35:35.900 align:start position:0%
you know who they're going to vote for
 
05:35:38.270 --> 05:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
in my experience I've never seen a
 
05:35:40.270 --> 05:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
school board representative or town
 
05:35:42.530 --> 05:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative vote against their own
 
05:35:46.430 --> 05:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
budget or against the other's budget
 
05:35:50.090 --> 05:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
this is unfair to the taxpayers on its
 
05:35:50.100 --> 05:35:51.410 align:start position:0%
this is unfair to the taxpayers on its
face

05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
face
 
05:35:53.570 --> 05:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I can't even I tried to play Devil's
 
05:35:54.890 --> 05:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
Advocate I can't even think of a reason
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
why it would be that way
 
05:36:01.010 --> 05:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
any changes that are proposed by the
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
municipal budget committee to cut taxes
 
05:36:05.150 --> 05:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
are automatically faced with two votes
 
05:36:07.550 --> 05:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
against them before they even start
 
05:36:09.948 --> 05:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
so my proposal is to keep them there
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
because they're valuable members as far
 
05:36:13.250 --> 05:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
as providing information to the board
 
05:36:15.830 --> 05:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're a great resource but having them
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to vote on their own budget
 
05:36:19.190 --> 05:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
and getting two bytes of the same Apple
 
05:36:21.470 --> 05:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
they already voted for it and supported
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
it in their own board then coming again
 
05:36:26.690 --> 05:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
getting another vote it's just so
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
fundamentally unfair and another
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative is going to speak to it
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
as well after I'm finished and I'm happy
 
05:36:34.730 --> 05:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you
 
05:36:36.170 --> 05:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative Roy are there any
 
05:36:42.010 --> 05:36:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:44.208 --> 05:36:44.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:36:46.550 --> 05:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's just a minor question and it
 
05:36:51.890 --> 05:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
pertains to line seven the
 
05:36:55.490 --> 05:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
um New text says governing body members
 
05:36:57.890 --> 05:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
and then on line eight it says school
 
05:37:00.410 --> 05:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
board ex-officio members is there a
 
05:37:03.530 --> 05:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
particular reason why the adjective X
 
05:37:07.970 --> 05:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
officio was omitted from
 
05:37:11.390 --> 05:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
governing body members no there wasn't
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
that would be an Ella um the LSR was
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
just drafted that way I didn't catch
 
05:37:18.770 --> 05:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
that thank you follow up
 
05:37:21.050 --> 05:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman would
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
you um be willing to perhaps put in an
 
05:37:25.730 --> 05:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
amendment to make to Absolutely I'll do
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
any leg work that you need to get it
 
05:37:30.110 --> 05:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
finished absolutely
 
05:37:32.750 --> 05:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
there any other questions seeing none
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you represent whoop sorry
 
05:37:36.770 --> 05:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative L Word
 
05:37:38.090 --> 05:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:42.288 --> 05:37:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:45.530 --> 05:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
on line seven
 
05:37:48.530 --> 05:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry six it mentions an alternate
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
member does that apply to the new
 
05:37:51.840 --> 05:37:54.650 align:start position:0%
member does that apply to the new
language

05:37:54.650 --> 05:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:37:54.660 --> 05:37:55.670 align:start position:0%
language
um

05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:58.550 --> 05:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
would be ex-officio school board and
 
05:38:01.670 --> 05:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
governing body and Alternate members no
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
it applies strictly to the two okay
 
05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:09.230 --> 05:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
okay now seeing no more questions thank
 
05:38:10.930 --> 05:38:10.940 align:start position:0%
you representative Roy thank you
 
05:38:22.310 --> 05:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:24.110 --> 05:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you uh
 
05:38:27.050 --> 05:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the the committee I
 
05:38:28.850 --> 05:38:28.860 align:start position:0%
know it's been a long day for you and I
 
05:38:30.890 --> 05:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
know I can get long-winded so I'll try
 
05:38:33.170 --> 05:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
to be try to be short
 
05:38:33.180 --> 05:38:34.250 align:start position:0%
to be try to be short
um

05:38:34.250 --> 05:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:36.350 --> 05:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
I I was very pleased to hear that
 
05:38:37.970 --> 05:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
um filed this to go back to the previous
 
05:38:41.280 --> 05:38:42.708 align:start position:0%
um filed this to go back to the previous
question

05:38:42.708 --> 05:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:38:45.050 --> 05:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that is an error so it
 
05:38:48.650 --> 05:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
would also it should also apply to the
 
05:38:50.570 --> 05:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
alternate right so just for point of
 
05:38:52.788 --> 05:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
clarification if we have a select board
 
05:38:55.190 --> 05:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
member or a school board member that is
 
05:38:56.930 --> 05:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
a member of the budget committee as
 
05:38:59.390 --> 05:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
assigned by their
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
their their their boards and they are
 
05:39:04.910 --> 05:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
not able to attend uh that's when they
 
05:39:06.650 --> 05:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
they send the alternate and the
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
alternate would also not be not be
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
voting right so there's a tradition in
 
05:39:14.448 --> 05:39:14.458 align:start position:0%
this this country it's a long tradition
 
05:39:16.250 --> 05:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
and it's a good tradition and that's one
 
05:39:18.350 --> 05:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
person one vote
 
05:39:22.128 --> 05:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
and as representative Roy pointed out
 
05:39:25.010 --> 05:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
these members have already had their
 
05:39:25.020 --> 05:39:25.910 align:start position:0%
these members have already had their
vote

05:39:25.910 --> 05:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:39:28.190 --> 05:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
they are a member of the uh the
 
05:39:30.170 --> 05:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
originating body that drafts the budget
 
05:39:32.448 --> 05:39:32.458 align:start position:0%
so they've they've had their chance to
 
05:39:34.430 --> 05:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
say yes or no
 
05:39:37.310 --> 05:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
to give them that chance again uh really
 
05:39:40.550 --> 05:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
is a second bite at the Apple
 
05:39:43.670 --> 05:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
the representatives that are coming from
 
05:39:46.788 --> 05:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
select boards and from school boards
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
are there to represent the position of
 
05:39:52.850 --> 05:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
their board the select board or the
 
05:39:55.030 --> 05:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
school board
 
05:39:59.090 --> 05:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
so we allow them to vote a second time
 
05:40:02.628 --> 05:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
how does the school board member
 
05:40:06.230 --> 05:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
know the position of the majority of the
 
05:40:07.610 --> 05:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
school board
 
05:40:11.030 --> 05:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
on a municipal budget line item
 
05:40:13.368 --> 05:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
so I admit I haven't been to every town
 
05:40:15.470 --> 05:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
I haven't been to every meeting but I've
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
never heard a school board discuss in
 
05:40:21.230 --> 05:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
any detail a town budget
 
05:40:23.810 --> 05:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
and likewise I have never heard a select
 
05:40:26.330 --> 05:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
board discuss in any detail
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
a school board budget
 
05:40:31.070 --> 05:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
but yet they're coming in
 
05:40:32.990 --> 05:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
representing the boards they come from
 
05:40:34.910 --> 05:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
so if I come from the select board I'm
 
05:40:36.650 --> 05:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
voting on a school budget but I have no
 
05:40:39.530 --> 05:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
way of knowing what it is the majority
 
05:40:42.470 --> 05:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
of my board would support on those
 
05:40:42.480 --> 05:40:44.090 align:start position:0%
of my board would support on those
questions

05:40:44.090 --> 05:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:40:47.330 --> 05:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
and that just seems
 
05:40:49.430 --> 05:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
that just seems wrong
 
05:40:52.368 --> 05:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
so for that reason I think it would be
 
05:40:55.670 --> 05:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
an improvement to the system to make
 
05:40:58.128 --> 05:40:58.138 align:start position:0%
them non-voting
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
members I I know in discussions with a
 
05:41:03.230 --> 05:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
lot of people
 
05:41:06.590 --> 05:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns would be will they
 
05:41:08.510 --> 05:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
they won't show up
 
05:41:11.448 --> 05:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
they won't participate
 
05:41:14.448 --> 05:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
and I would say that's incorrect they
 
05:41:16.010 --> 05:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
will certainly show up they will
 
05:41:18.770 --> 05:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
certainly continue to participate one if
 
05:41:20.690 --> 05:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
they if they don't I think the voters
 
05:41:22.250 --> 05:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
would be very disappointed in that type
 
05:41:23.990 --> 05:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
of behavior and they would probably get
 
05:41:27.170 --> 05:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
voted out of office and even if even if
 
05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
they choose not to participate
 
05:41:31.010 --> 05:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
you know they're not they're not
 
05:41:32.690 --> 05:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
required the budget committee can do
 
05:41:34.190 --> 05:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
anything that it wants to do with the
 
05:41:36.530 --> 05:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
majority with a majority vote so it's
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
obviously in their interest to come and
 
05:41:41.690 --> 05:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
freely advise and so for that reason
 
05:41:43.610 --> 05:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
um I I think this is a good bill I think
 
05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
it does need a friendly amendment to
 
05:41:48.830 --> 05:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're we're getting the
 
05:41:48.840 --> 05:41:49.730 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're we're getting the
uh

05:41:49.730 --> 05:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:41:54.050 --> 05:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
the the replacement uh members as well
 
05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time and I'll take
 
05:41:58.010 --> 05:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have
 
05:41:59.448 --> 05:41:59.458 align:start position:0%

05:41:59.458 --> 05:42:01.310 align:start position:0%
make sure your testimony represent

thank you it's good to see you this
afternoon

05:42:06.050 --> 05:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:08.090 --> 05:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
um incompatibility of offices under the
 
05:42:10.798 --> 05:42:11.590 align:start position:0%
um incompatibility of offices under the
election

05:42:11.590 --> 05:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
election
 
05:42:14.448 --> 05:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
laws that says that a
 
05:42:18.650 --> 05:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:21.708 --> 05:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
um School Board member except a
 
05:42:24.410 --> 05:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School Board member shall at
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
the same time serve as a budget
 
05:42:29.628 --> 05:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
Committee Member at large under RSA 32 I
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
am I'm sorry it's nice to see you this
 
05:42:34.190 --> 05:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon as well yes thank you for the
 
05:42:36.830 --> 05:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
question I I am aware of that and that
 
05:42:39.410 --> 05:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
is that certainly flies in the face of
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
what we what we are currently doing and
 
05:42:44.330 --> 05:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
that's why this bill is is needed so so
 
05:42:46.730 --> 05:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
for clarity right
 
05:42:48.830 --> 05:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
I live in Deerfield I'm rocking him too
 
05:42:50.868 --> 05:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
right so I live in Deerfield I can't be
 
05:42:52.970 --> 05:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
an elected member to the municipal
 
05:42:55.368 --> 05:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
budget committee and the school board at
 
05:42:56.868 --> 05:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
05:42:58.788 --> 05:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
yet we allow the school board to appoint
 
05:43:00.230 --> 05:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
a member to the municipal budget
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee as a voting member that
 
05:43:03.770 --> 05:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
otherwise would be completely disallowed
 
05:43:06.650 --> 05:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
by law and so that certainly is an
 
05:43:09.230 --> 05:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
incongruity that supports passage of of
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
05:43:13.970 --> 05:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:43:17.150 --> 05:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative truella
 
05:43:19.430 --> 05:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you once again Mr chair and thanks
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative for coming to testify
 
05:43:24.470 --> 05:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
before us today I'm not sure I just need
 
05:43:26.090 --> 05:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
a clarification I'm not sure if I
 
05:43:26.100 --> 05:43:28.190 align:start position:0%
a clarification I'm not sure if I
misunderstood

05:43:28.190 --> 05:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
misunderstood
 
05:43:28.200 --> 05:43:28.850 align:start position:0%
misunderstood
um

05:43:28.850 --> 05:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
the portion of the bill um line six
 
05:43:33.360 --> 05:43:34.610 align:start position:0%
the portion of the bill um line six
seven

05:43:34.610 --> 05:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
seven
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
that basically says each member if a
 
05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
person is absent
 
05:43:42.590 --> 05:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
each missing member shall be represented
 
05:43:45.470 --> 05:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
by an alternate designated by the board
 
05:43:47.150 --> 05:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
who then shall
 
05:43:49.788 --> 05:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
when sitting have the same Authority as
 
05:43:51.948 --> 05:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
the regular member
 
05:43:54.048 --> 05:43:54.058 align:start position:0%
I understood you to say that they would
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
not so I I may have misunderstood you
 
05:43:58.910 --> 05:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank thank you so
 
05:43:58.920 --> 05:43:59.570 align:start position:0%
yeah thank thank you so
um

05:43:59.570 --> 05:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:02.090 --> 05:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
I have to admit thinking on my feet
 
05:44:04.850 --> 05:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
quickly is not my task give me a
 
05:44:06.470 --> 05:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
question today and you'll get an awesome
 
05:44:08.570 --> 05:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
answer tomorrow ask me a question today
 
05:44:11.570 --> 05:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
you'll get a little bit of a sloppy uh
 
05:44:13.010 --> 05:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
answer today because that's how my head
 
05:44:16.670 --> 05:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
works so to be clear we have a school
 
05:44:18.530 --> 05:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
board member that's appointed by the
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
school board a select board member
 
05:44:22.448 --> 05:44:22.458 align:start position:0%
that's appointed by the select board
 
05:44:26.208 --> 05:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
they also name alternates at the time
 
05:44:29.270 --> 05:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
that they assign those roles so that if
 
05:44:31.548 --> 05:44:31.558 align:start position:0%
the person that's designated to be that
 
05:44:33.288 --> 05:44:33.298 align:start position:0%
that representative cross-board
 
05:44:35.628 --> 05:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
representative is not available then the
 
05:44:38.868 --> 05:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
alternate can sit in in the original
 
05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
person's place
 
05:44:43.788 --> 05:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of this legislation is to
 
05:44:45.410 --> 05:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
keep the school board member to prevent
 
05:44:47.090 --> 05:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
not keep to prevent the school board
 
05:44:49.430 --> 05:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
member and the select board member from
 
05:44:52.250 --> 05:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
voting on questions then it would stand
 
05:44:54.530 --> 05:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
to reason that their alternates would
 
05:44:57.288 --> 05:44:57.298 align:start position:0%
also be disallowed from voting on those
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions otherwise the they work around
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
on the law would simply be never send
 
05:45:05.330 --> 05:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
the person that's appointed always send
 
05:45:08.208 --> 05:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
the alternate and get the vote I do not
 
05:45:10.128 --> 05:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
believe that the the alternates that are
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
discussed here are referring to elected
 
05:45:14.890 --> 05:45:14.900 align:start position:0%
budget committee members elected from
 
05:45:17.690 --> 05:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
elected at The Ballot Box Force just the
 
05:45:19.548 --> 05:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
the budget committee that those
 
05:45:21.530 --> 05:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
alternates are only referring back to
 
05:45:24.170 --> 05:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
select and and school thank you
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative and I think you've um
 
05:45:28.128 --> 05:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
you've blown your own estimation of
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
yourself because that was an excellent
 
05:45:32.510 --> 05:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
answer and it's today it's now I really
 
05:45:34.430 --> 05:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you I appreciate the
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
kind words thank you

05:45:46.378 --> 05:45:48.170 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

05:45:48.170 --> 05:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:55.610 --> 05:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
does the budget committee is it is it
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
their responsibility to
 
05:45:58.440 --> 05:46:00.530 align:start position:0%
their responsibility to
present

05:46:00.530 --> 05:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
present
 
05:46:03.410 --> 05:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh the budget
 
05:46:03.420 --> 05:46:05.810 align:start position:0%
uh the budget
and

05:46:05.810 --> 05:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:46:05.820 --> 05:46:09.048 align:start position:0%
and
uh

05:46:09.048 --> 05:46:09.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:12.110 --> 05:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
yeah to the to the other bodies and to
 
05:46:13.788 --> 05:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's an
 
05:46:17.150 --> 05:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
05:46:19.430 --> 05:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
um just by way of of background so you
 
05:46:21.948 --> 05:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
understand from where I come
 
05:46:23.990 --> 05:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
um when I turned 18 I started going to
 
05:46:25.730 --> 05:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
town meeting I grew up in Pembroke right
 
05:46:27.708 --> 05:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
love love town meeting
 
05:46:30.110 --> 05:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
moved around here and there and I've
 
05:46:31.850 --> 05:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
lived in Deerfield a long time we're in
 
05:46:35.868 --> 05:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
sb2 town so my familiarity is much
 
05:46:37.850 --> 05:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
stronger with sb2 than it is with town
 
05:46:40.490 --> 05:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
meeting only because decades have swept
 
05:46:41.570 --> 05:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
past me
 
05:46:43.368 --> 05:46:43.378 align:start position:0%
um over time
 
05:46:46.970 --> 05:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
so the way it works in an sb2 town and I
 
05:46:48.350 --> 05:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
believe as well as a traditional town
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
meeting but please correct me if I'm
 
05:46:52.970 --> 05:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
wrong is that typically the select board
 
05:46:55.850 --> 05:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
and the school board craft a proposed
 
05:46:58.430 --> 05:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
budget so the school board would go to
 
05:46:59.930 --> 05:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
the administration the administration
 
05:47:03.110 --> 05:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
goes to to the staff to you know to the
 
05:47:04.850 --> 05:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
teachers what not they craft this budget
 
05:47:07.490 --> 05:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
and then they bring that to the budget
 
05:47:09.048 --> 05:47:09.058 align:start position:0%
committee the same is true for the
 
05:47:10.910 --> 05:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
select board so the select board talks
 
05:47:12.890 --> 05:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
to department heads and and other people
 
05:47:15.470 --> 05:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
under their charge they craft a budget
 
05:47:17.150 --> 05:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
that budget is then given to the budget
 
05:47:18.890 --> 05:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
committee when it's given to the budget
 
05:47:20.810 --> 05:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
committee when it's handed over
 
05:47:22.850 --> 05:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
it is now the municipal budget
 
05:47:25.490 --> 05:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
committee's budget so the budget
 
05:47:28.610 --> 05:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
committee can do whatever they see fit
 
05:47:32.990 --> 05:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
with a majority vote with that budget
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
if it's a traditional town meeting the
 
05:47:38.510 --> 05:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
next stop would be the town meeting and
 
05:47:40.910 --> 05:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
there it would be debated by the general
 
05:47:43.128 --> 05:47:43.138 align:start position:0%
public and whatever votes are taken
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
whatever decisions are made are Final in
 
05:47:49.610 --> 05:47:49.620 align:start position:0%
an sb2 situation it would go to the
 
05:47:51.770 --> 05:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
first session often referred to as the
 
05:47:53.330 --> 05:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
deliberative session at the deliberative
 
05:47:56.090 --> 05:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
session again the general public has the
 
05:47:57.470 --> 05:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
the right to show up ask questions
 
05:48:00.048 --> 05:48:00.058 align:start position:0%
debate make motions and make changes
 
05:48:03.350 --> 05:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
with limitations
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that's the the deliberative session
 
05:48:08.030 --> 05:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
gets the budget committee's budget and
 
05:48:10.128 --> 05:48:10.138 align:start position:0%
then whatever they pass out of
 
05:48:12.350 --> 05:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
deliberative that's what would appear um
 
05:48:14.990 --> 05:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
on the the warrant to be voted um at the
 
05:48:17.330 --> 05:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
at the general election
 
05:48:18.830 --> 05:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay does that answer your question sir
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
yep thank you
 
05:48:23.628 --> 05:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative majority
 
05:48:27.410 --> 05:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just to uh uh
 
05:48:30.890 --> 05:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
um representative Missouri's up
 
05:48:33.048 --> 05:48:33.058 align:start position:0%
somebody's on the board has a name like
 
05:48:35.810 --> 05:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
me I'm sorry Mr
 
05:48:37.250 --> 05:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:48:38.990 --> 05:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
taking the question for clarity it says
 
05:48:41.448 --> 05:48:41.458 align:start position:0%
on any matter if there is an amendment
 
05:48:44.930 --> 05:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
in the budget committee meeting
 
05:48:48.288 --> 05:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
is would you would this say that the
 
05:48:50.090 --> 05:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
select board representative then is also
 
05:48:52.850 --> 05:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
not allowed to vote on that Amendment
 
05:48:53.930 --> 05:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
just the amendment not the
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the budget in total
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
but on just the amendment also would it
 
05:48:58.970 --> 05:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
include any amendment is my question all
 
05:49:00.830 --> 05:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the question so the
 
05:49:03.470 --> 05:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
the the purpose and the intent of the
 
05:49:07.610 --> 05:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
legislation is to disallow select board
 
05:49:09.770 --> 05:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
members and school board members to vote
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
on any and all questions coming before
 
05:49:15.410 --> 05:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
that committee so they're there in an
 
05:49:18.890 --> 05:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
advisory role so if somebody makes a
 
05:49:20.570 --> 05:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
motion to add a hundred thousand dollars
 
05:49:22.310 --> 05:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
to Highway
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
um the the select board member would not
 
05:49:28.128 --> 05:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
be voting on that Amendment it's it's
 
05:49:30.708 --> 05:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
just there just there for advisory
 
05:49:30.718 --> 05:49:32.390 align:start position:0%
just there just there for advisory
purposes

05:49:32.390 --> 05:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
05:49:34.190 --> 05:49:34.200 align:start position:0%

Bill too that uh as in my town the
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
budget committee is advisory and has no
 
05:50:02.750 --> 05:50:02.760 align:start position:0%

05:50:05.390 --> 05:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the question and
 
05:50:08.030 --> 05:50:08.040 align:start position:0%

there's there's a lot of details
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
representative verbal I think we're kind
 
05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
of there are two types they're advisory
 
05:50:26.090 --> 05:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
um budget committees and they're
 
05:50:28.548 --> 05:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
authoritative budget committees
 
05:50:30.170 --> 05:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
um this really
 
05:50:32.690 --> 05:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
um is is for both but but critically
 
05:50:34.548 --> 05:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
important for authoritative budget
 
05:50:37.250 --> 05:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
committees because they are actually
 
05:50:37.260 --> 05:50:38.150 align:start position:0%
committees because they are actually
um

05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:41.868 --> 05:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
a middle step between the governing body
 
05:50:44.090 --> 05:50:44.100 align:start position:0%

05:51:47.510 --> 05:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you for pointing that out
 
05:51:47.520 --> 05:51:48.650 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you for pointing that out
um

05:51:48.650 --> 05:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of this bill
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
and um the main reason that we should be
 
05:51:59.930 --> 05:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill is that there is a
 
05:52:04.368 --> 05:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
built-in obstruction to the intent that
 
05:52:07.368 --> 05:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
this bill was originally written that
 
05:52:10.970 --> 05:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
obstruction is the addition of members
 
05:52:14.208 --> 05:52:14.218 align:start position:0%
from the border Selectmen and the budget
 
05:52:16.670 --> 05:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:52:20.090 --> 05:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
and the school boards who get to vote
 
05:52:22.548 --> 05:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:52:26.208 --> 05:52:26.218 align:start position:0%
in sb2 the budget committees are the
 
05:52:28.850 --> 05:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
governing body that actually sets the
 
05:52:31.788 --> 05:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
budget the budgets that we receive are
 
05:52:34.548 --> 05:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
proposed and then we set the budget that
 
05:52:37.208 --> 05:52:37.218 align:start position:0%
goes to the town deliberative session
 
05:52:40.850 --> 05:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
which in turn ends up on the ballot with
 
05:52:43.250 --> 05:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
whatever amendments come in
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
my experience over the past seven
 
05:52:49.850 --> 05:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
budgets is that we have never had a
 
05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
school board member or a select board
 
05:52:57.830 --> 05:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
member vote against or vote for any
 
05:53:01.128 --> 05:53:01.138 align:start position:0%
changes to the budgets it's it's not
 
05:53:03.948 --> 05:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
only an Unwritten rule rule but candidly
 
05:53:08.390 --> 05:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
the representative from the uh
 
05:53:11.090 --> 05:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
School Board in the most recent budget
 
05:53:14.150 --> 05:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
even said to me well
 
05:53:18.350 --> 05:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
I expect the select board member to vote
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
for my budget I mean it's it's not it's
 
05:53:23.690 --> 05:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
just an automatic that we have
 
05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
two people against making any changes we
 
05:53:29.810 --> 05:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
have a seven member board that's elected
 
05:53:33.470 --> 05:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
as a budget committee to make the
 
05:53:36.230 --> 05:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
decision for the town
 
05:53:39.048 --> 05:53:39.058 align:start position:0%
um the budget the intention of having a
 
05:53:41.208 --> 05:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
budget committee is specifically so that
 
05:53:44.270 --> 05:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
the the the boards that are proposing
 
05:53:46.190 --> 05:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
their budget are not the ones that are
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
approving the budget it's none of the
 
05:53:51.650 --> 05:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
towns are required to have a budget
 
05:53:54.230 --> 05:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee even under sb2 we could just
 
05:53:57.530 --> 05:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
let it run as uh the select board and
 
05:53:59.448 --> 05:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
the school uh board could vote on the
 
05:54:01.310 --> 05:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
budget and that would be it but the
 
05:54:03.490 --> 05:54:03.500 align:start position:0%
budget committees are specifically
 
05:54:08.390 --> 05:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
installed to govern the uh to to act as
 
05:54:12.410 --> 05:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
a governor to prevent unnecessary
 
05:54:16.128 --> 05:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
spending and to keep taxes in check
 
05:54:18.830 --> 05:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
and they need to be independent they're
 
05:54:20.810 --> 05:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
not independent when we have two votes
 
05:54:24.470 --> 05:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
against we have seven members of our
 
05:54:27.048 --> 05:54:27.058 align:start position:0%
budget committee I need to have five
 
05:54:31.010 --> 05:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
votes to make any cuts for the first
 
05:54:33.948 --> 05:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
five years that I presided over the
 
05:54:33.958 --> 05:54:35.750 align:start position:0%
five years that I presided over the
budgets

05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
05:54:38.270 --> 05:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
I had members on the committee that was
 
05:54:40.750 --> 05:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
simply rubber stamps they just whatever
 
05:54:44.150 --> 05:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
the town and the school proposed they
 
05:54:46.970 --> 05:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
just said yes we couldn't cut 10 cents
 
05:54:49.250 --> 05:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
out of the budget because I didn't have
 
05:54:53.830 --> 05:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
a majority now I've worked hard at
 
05:54:57.350 --> 05:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
recruiting members to join the budget
 
05:54:58.910 --> 05:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee that are willing to be
 
05:55:01.250 --> 05:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
reasonable and
 
05:55:04.250 --> 05:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
and potentially make changes to the
 
05:55:07.548 --> 05:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
proposed budgets from these uh other
 
05:55:11.750 --> 05:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
boards and I need five members of a
 
05:55:13.368 --> 05:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
seven member board
 
05:55:16.250 --> 05:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
in order to make any change
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
the seven members were elected to be on
 
05:55:21.770 --> 05:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
the budget committee that's their job
 
05:55:24.830 --> 05:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the voters have intended and
 
05:55:27.110 --> 05:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
I believe that's the intention of the
 
05:55:30.530 --> 05:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
original Law and I I doubt that when the
 
05:55:34.730 --> 05:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
original law was a place that they had
 
05:55:38.810 --> 05:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
considered the possibility that the two
 
05:55:41.570 --> 05:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
members from the the school board and
 
05:55:43.490 --> 05:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
the select board would always vote
 
05:55:46.430 --> 05:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
against every budget change I'm sure
 
05:55:48.350 --> 05:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
that the intention was to have them
 
05:55:51.530 --> 05:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
there to advise the budget committee
 
05:55:54.230 --> 05:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
members who are elected to
 
05:55:56.650 --> 05:55:56.660 align:start position:0%
manage the budget
 
05:55:59.628 --> 05:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
so I think this really is a correction
 
05:56:02.510 --> 05:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
to the intention and the spirit of the
 
05:56:05.448 --> 05:56:05.458 align:start position:0%
law that was originally written and I
 
05:56:08.330 --> 05:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
can tell you from my experience that we
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
are being obstructed and if I had not
 
05:56:15.890 --> 05:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
been able to uh get five members of our
 
05:56:18.170 --> 05:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
seven-member board elected we would not
 
05:56:20.810 --> 05:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
be able to control our budget in Salem
 
05:56:23.570 --> 05:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it's it's an important
 
05:56:26.990 --> 05:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
function of every government to have an
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
independent uh group to be able to look
 
05:56:32.030 --> 05:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
at what is being spent and to try to
 
05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
keep our taxes affordable and especially
 
05:56:38.270 --> 05:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
affordable for the the folks who don't
 
05:56:41.030 --> 05:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot of money I I I'm there
 
05:56:44.930 --> 05:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
fighting for the people who are on you
 
05:56:46.610 --> 05:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
know having difficulty paying their
 
05:56:49.128 --> 05:56:49.138 align:start position:0%
bills and paying the heating bills and
 
05:56:51.910 --> 05:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's my concern I never hear from
 
05:56:55.310 --> 05:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
constituents that say to me boy you
 
05:56:56.750 --> 05:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
should raise the taxes so that we could
 
05:56:58.970 --> 05:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
do more I mean there's an unlimited
 
05:57:01.430 --> 05:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
amount of Mr Dakota
 
05:57:03.230 --> 05:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
um I know you you weren't probably in
 
05:57:05.570 --> 05:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
the room prior but we were trying to
 
05:57:07.730 --> 05:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
limit testimony to a reasonable amount
 
05:57:10.850 --> 05:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
of time we didn't start a a clock on you
 
05:57:12.708 --> 05:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
but if you could get very close to
 
05:57:15.830 --> 05:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
wrapping it up and speak exactly kind of
 
05:57:19.610 --> 05:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:22.190 --> 05:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
your passion but if you could thank you
 
05:57:25.490 --> 05:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you uh well I've pretty much said
 
05:57:28.190 --> 05:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
what I need to uh Express I'd be happy
 
05:57:31.250 --> 05:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that you would
 
05:57:33.410 --> 05:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
have from my experience on the budget
 
05:57:35.270 --> 05:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your testimony
 
05:57:39.230 --> 05:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
05:57:42.590 --> 05:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much
 
05:57:49.670 --> 05:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:53.208 --> 05:57:53.218 align:start position:0%

05:57:55.740 --> 05:58:03.948 align:start position:0%
that's fine sure uh we'll call it Ted
Trust

05:58:03.948 --> 05:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:05.810 --> 05:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Ted trost
 
05:58:10.430 --> 05:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm from the town of Hudson I've served
 
05:58:11.990 --> 05:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the Hudson budget committee now for
 
05:58:14.270 --> 05:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
eight budget cycles and am the current
 
05:58:17.090 --> 05:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
chair of the Hudson budget committee I
 
05:58:19.610 --> 05:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
support hb123
 
05:58:22.090 --> 05:58:22.100 align:start position:0%
some of you may recall that last spring
 
05:58:24.830 --> 05:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
the Hudson budget committee took actions
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
to strip the budget the school board and
 
05:58:29.150 --> 05:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
the board of Selectmen from voting on
 
05:58:31.310 --> 05:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
the budget committee this resulted in
 
05:58:32.930 --> 05:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
the school board in select board suing
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
the budget committee which we ultimately
 
05:58:34.920 --> 05:58:36.948 align:start position:0%
the budget committee which we ultimately
lost

05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
lost
 
05:58:36.958 --> 05:58:37.730 align:start position:0%
lost
um

05:58:37.730 --> 05:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for this bill to pass because
 
05:58:42.708 --> 05:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
the school board and board of Selectmen
 
05:58:45.170 --> 05:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
in in communities spend many weeks
 
05:58:48.110 --> 05:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
crafting their budgets before forwarding
 
05:58:50.930 --> 05:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
a final budget to the respective budget
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee to allow those Liaisons to
 
05:58:54.708 --> 05:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
have votes on the budget committees
 
05:58:57.048 --> 05:58:57.058 align:start position:0%
after they have already completed their
 
05:58:59.390 --> 05:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
work and allowed them to now vote again
 
05:59:01.430 --> 05:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
on changes to their budgets allows for
 
05:59:02.810 --> 05:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
them to subvert the budget committee's
 
05:59:04.850 --> 05:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
efforts to present a budget that the
 
05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
voters find agreeable and represents a
 
05:59:10.730 --> 05:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
prudent appropriation of public funds
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
the primary effect of leaving the boards
 
05:59:14.930 --> 05:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
with voting ability that is to not pass
 
05:59:16.970 --> 05:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
this bill on a budget committee is to
 
05:59:18.410 --> 05:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
impede the ability of a budget committee
 
05:59:20.990 --> 05:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
to formulate its own budget to present
 
05:59:22.310 --> 05:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
to the voters
 
05:59:24.470 --> 05:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
when a motion is made in a budget
 
05:59:26.570 --> 05:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
committee to reduce budget amounts
 
05:59:28.128 --> 05:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
the Liaisons from those boards
 
05:59:30.470 --> 05:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
invariably vote about vote against it
 
05:59:32.690 --> 05:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
every motion to reduce a school budget
 
05:59:34.730 --> 05:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
or a town budget in a budget committee
 
05:59:37.190 --> 05:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
and inevitably starts with one and
 
05:59:39.708 --> 05:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes two vote disadvantage
 
05:59:41.690 --> 05:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
I ask that you vote ought to pass and
 
05:59:43.430 --> 05:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
return the full budget process to the
 
05:59:46.810 --> 05:59:46.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.570 --> 05:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
any questions representative power thank
 
05:59:52.010 --> 05:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:59:54.000 --> 05:59:54.708 align:start position:0%
my question
um

05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:56.930 --> 05:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
when a municipality has a statutory
 
05:59:58.730 --> 05:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
budget committee that's an official
 
06:00:00.770 --> 06:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
budget committee as opposed to a finance
 
06:00:03.230 --> 06:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
committee which is advisory only
 
06:00:06.350 --> 06:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
is it specified in statute that the
 
06:00:06.360 --> 06:00:07.390 align:start position:0%
is it specified in statute that the
budget

06:00:07.390 --> 06:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
belongs to the budget committee and
 
06:00:12.350 --> 06:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
therefore the budget committee is
 
06:00:14.230 --> 06:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
06:00:14.240 --> 06:00:15.850 align:start position:0%
responsible for
crafting

06:00:15.850 --> 06:00:15.860 align:start position:0%
crafting
 
06:00:18.410 --> 06:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
that budget it's their budget it
 
06:00:20.930 --> 06:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
originates with the budget committee and
 
06:00:24.890 --> 06:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
that a governing body select board or
 
06:00:27.410 --> 06:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
School Board they provide input to that
 
06:00:30.110 --> 06:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little confused as to why I've
 
06:00:31.690 --> 06:00:31.700 align:start position:0%
heard testimony
 
06:00:35.208 --> 06:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
stating that these governing bodies
 
06:00:37.910 --> 06:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
they have budgets and there's a conflict
 
06:00:40.128 --> 06:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
between two budgets could you speak to
 
06:00:41.930 --> 06:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
them yes thank you for the question that
 
06:00:43.430 --> 06:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
was confusing to me as well when I
 
06:00:45.230 --> 06:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
started on the budget committee so it's
 
06:00:47.090 --> 06:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
06:00:49.850 --> 06:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
in the case of budgets
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
um the school board and the select board
 
06:00:53.930 --> 06:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
both prepare their budgets and forwarded
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
them to the budget committees whether
 
06:00:56.990 --> 06:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
they are required to or not I'm not
 
06:00:59.390 --> 06:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
really clear on that however that is the
 
06:01:01.548 --> 06:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
way that it works in Hudson we are an
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
sb2 community in case that's relevant
 
06:01:05.750 --> 06:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the budget committee at that point
 
06:01:07.310 --> 06:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
does have the option we could throw
 
06:01:08.750 --> 06:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
those budgets in the garbage and start
 
06:01:10.430 --> 06:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
from scratch we absolutely could do that
 
06:01:10.440 --> 06:01:11.948 align:start position:0%
from scratch we absolutely could do that
however

06:01:11.948 --> 06:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:01:14.090 --> 06:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself not the budget
 
06:01:14.100 --> 06:01:15.288 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself not the budget
committee

06:01:15.288 --> 06:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:01:15.298 --> 06:01:15.830 align:start position:0%
committee
um

06:01:15.830 --> 06:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:17.930 --> 06:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
there is value in seeing where they
 
06:01:19.610 --> 06:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
Place their priorities where they see
 
06:01:21.530 --> 06:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be made it does
 
06:01:23.448 --> 06:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
spur discussion with those board members
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
who appear before or who appear with us
 
06:01:27.470 --> 06:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
in the budget committee
 
06:01:29.330 --> 06:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
um so I see there is value for that but
 
06:01:31.850 --> 06:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
that is that is the way that it works
 
06:01:34.010 --> 06:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
um in Hudson is that the school board
 
06:01:36.170 --> 06:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
and the board of Select do prepare a
 
06:01:37.310 --> 06:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
budget and forward it to the budget
 
06:01:37.320 --> 06:01:42.048 align:start position:0%
budget and forward it to the budget
committee

06:01:42.048 --> 06:01:42.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:44.330 --> 06:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:01:46.128 --> 06:01:46.138 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
06:01:59.810 --> 06:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Robert Clegg I also
 
06:02:03.410 --> 06:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
serve on the Hudson's budget committee
 
06:02:06.948 --> 06:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
and I apologize because I I had copies
 
06:02:10.010 --> 06:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
of the court case which may answer a
 
06:02:11.330 --> 06:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
whole lot of questions I'll bring them
 
06:02:13.250 --> 06:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I don't know where I left them
 
06:02:14.570 --> 06:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
there's some place over on the other
 
06:02:14.580 --> 06:02:16.730 align:start position:0%
there's some place over on the other
body

06:02:16.730 --> 06:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
body
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
um when we when we were sued by the
 
06:02:21.410 --> 06:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
Hudson school board and in the board of
 
06:02:23.628 --> 06:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
Selectmen we were sued because we
 
06:02:26.930 --> 06:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
decided in the law it says Liaisons
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
and in the law you have ex-official
 
06:02:29.040 --> 06:02:30.230 align:start position:0%
and in the law you have ex-official
members

06:02:30.230 --> 06:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:02:33.350 --> 06:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
our members that come in from the school
 
06:02:36.170 --> 06:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
board and from the select board are
 
06:02:36.180 --> 06:02:37.548 align:start position:0%
board and from the select board are
Liaisons

06:02:37.548 --> 06:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
Liaisons
 
06:02:40.310 --> 06:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
so we said we read the law that's and
 
06:02:41.868 --> 06:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
you can't vote
 
06:02:43.850 --> 06:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
so they sued us
 
06:02:45.830 --> 06:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
the superior court judge
 
06:02:49.010 --> 06:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
decided that Liaisons Annex official
 
06:02:51.230 --> 06:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
members are the same
 
06:02:54.110 --> 06:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
and she decided that we were wrong in
 
06:02:56.590 --> 06:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
that they had every right to vote
 
06:02:56.600 --> 06:02:58.330 align:start position:0%
that they had every right to vote
the

06:02:58.330 --> 06:02:58.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:03:00.650 --> 06:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
lawyer for the
 
06:03:02.330 --> 06:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
the town
 
06:03:04.430 --> 06:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
basically said that
 
06:03:07.970 --> 06:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
no member of the school board or the
 
06:03:11.628 --> 06:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen was required to vote
 
06:03:14.030 --> 06:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
as the school board or the board of
 
06:03:17.090 --> 06:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
Selectmen had voted already
 
06:03:19.970 --> 06:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
just the other night we had the chair of
 
06:03:21.470 --> 06:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
as the representative sitting on our
 
06:03:26.930 --> 06:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
committee tell us he voted against
 
06:03:29.570 --> 06:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
the expenditure of 27 million dollars as
 
06:03:31.430 --> 06:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
the chair of the school board
 
06:03:33.910 --> 06:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
but since he was there as the
 
06:03:36.590 --> 06:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
liaisonic's official member of the
 
06:03:38.448 --> 06:03:38.458 align:start position:0%
school board he would have to change his
 
06:03:39.948 --> 06:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
vote in the committee
 
06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
and vote in favor of the expenditure
 
06:03:44.510 --> 06:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what we found everything they
 
06:03:45.890 --> 06:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
said to the court
 
06:03:48.470 --> 06:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
is untrue they come they have one vote
 
06:03:50.030 --> 06:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
One Voice
 
06:03:52.850 --> 06:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
and and and the courts don't believe it
 
06:03:54.890 --> 06:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
and the courts basically said fix the
 
06:03:54.900 --> 06:03:55.730 align:start position:0%
and the courts basically said fix the
law

06:03:55.730 --> 06:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:03:58.010 --> 06:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
I as I said I will get you the court
 
06:03:58.020 --> 06:03:59.270 align:start position:0%
I as I said I will get you the court
case

06:03:59.270 --> 06:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
case
 
06:04:00.650 --> 06:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
um I'll drop have it dropped off at your
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
office I know you're in session tomorrow
 
06:04:04.670 --> 06:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
um but it's very important that you see
 
06:04:06.170 --> 06:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
that the courts
 
06:04:08.570 --> 06:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
we everything most people here said
 
06:04:11.090 --> 06:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
already is what we did
 
06:04:12.948 --> 06:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
we could have taken it and we could have
 
06:04:15.470 --> 06:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
gone to the Supreme Court but the budget
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
committee didn't feel right about
 
06:04:18.530 --> 06:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
spending any money we represented
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves in the Superior Court
 
06:04:22.730 --> 06:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
and said there's no reason for us to
 
06:04:24.530 --> 06:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
spend the money they spent
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars to make
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
sure that they had a vote on the budget
 
06:04:30.000 --> 06:04:31.310 align:start position:0%
sure that they had a vote on the budget
committee

06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:04:33.708 --> 06:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
so my chairman had to leave because we
 
06:04:36.410 --> 06:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
actually had to suspend our vote the
 
06:04:37.610 --> 06:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
other night
 
06:04:40.250 --> 06:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
until today because the
 
06:04:43.390 --> 06:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
schools refused to give us information
 
06:04:45.410 --> 06:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
and figured well if we don't give you
 
06:04:47.690 --> 06:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
the information and you can't vote on it
 
06:04:49.850 --> 06:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
so we have a very contentious system in
 
06:04:51.708 --> 06:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
Hudson always has been we are an sb2
 
06:04:51.718 --> 06:04:52.670 align:start position:0%
Hudson always has been we are an sb2
town

06:04:52.670 --> 06:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
town
 
06:04:55.368 --> 06:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
but this law is absolutely positively
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
needed I would like to offer that we
 
06:05:01.010 --> 06:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
need to talk about Liaisons as well it's
 
06:05:02.990 --> 06:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the same statute just not this
 
06:05:05.990 --> 06:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
section a liaison and an ex-officio
 
06:05:08.990 --> 06:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
member shouldn't vote they should be
 
06:05:10.548 --> 06:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
there as advisory they should be able to
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
explain to us why they did something
 
06:05:14.930 --> 06:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
that maybe we don't understand but
 
06:05:16.970 --> 06:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
06:05:18.530 --> 06:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
um this isn't my first time on the board
 
06:05:20.628 --> 06:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
so most of us that sit there sit there
 
06:05:22.368 --> 06:05:22.378 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to keep taxes done
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
we're a working family time
 
06:05:27.170 --> 06:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:05:29.208 --> 06:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
you were done sorry representative
 
06:05:29.218 --> 06:05:30.350 align:start position:0%
you were done sorry representative
Guthrie

06:05:30.350 --> 06:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
Guthrie
 
06:05:33.048 --> 06:05:33.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman welcome back
 
06:05:35.948 --> 06:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
uh am I
 
06:05:38.990 --> 06:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
how many members are on the budget
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
committee if the school and the in the
 
06:05:47.350 --> 06:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
town is excluded as liaison uh whatever
 
06:05:51.110 --> 06:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
ex-officio so when these step away
 
06:05:53.570 --> 06:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
how many members how many voting members
 
06:05:56.448 --> 06:05:56.458 align:start position:0%
are on the board is it five or seven do
 
06:05:58.730 --> 06:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
you have a seven member budget board
 
06:06:02.690 --> 06:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
with two alaisons or do you have
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
seven just seven members uh what What's
 
06:06:07.910 --> 06:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
the what's the breakup of the committee
 
06:06:12.410 --> 06:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
when you make these two ex-officios not
 
06:06:15.830 --> 06:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
being able to vote we have seven actual
 
06:06:18.288 --> 06:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
elected people to the budget committee
 
06:06:21.110 --> 06:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
and then we have two Liaisons making the
 
06:06:22.730 --> 06:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
total number of votes that we have to
 
06:06:24.708 --> 06:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
count nine
 
06:06:27.650 --> 06:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
and as the chair said previously from
 
06:06:30.530 --> 06:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
the Dodson chair
 
06:06:33.170 --> 06:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
um we start out with two no votes on any
 
06:06:35.930 --> 06:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
cut we ever do and if somebody's not
 
06:06:38.390 --> 06:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
there we actually have
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
um another member who is a
 
06:06:44.750 --> 06:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
is in Conflict but
 
06:06:47.150 --> 06:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
she's she's a full-time employee of the
 
06:06:49.070 --> 06:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
school and the law says you can't be on
 
06:06:51.548 --> 06:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
the budget committee
 
06:06:53.810 --> 06:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
they've played so much with the budget
 
06:06:56.690 --> 06:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
committee laws that this is the first
 
06:06:58.610 --> 06:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
step towards actually creating something
 
06:07:00.650 --> 06:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
that allows the people's voice to be
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
heard I'm if I may
 
06:07:06.530 --> 06:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
if my name is to change is to clarify I
 
06:07:13.548 --> 06:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:16.070 --> 06:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
let's assume that the two are off we
 
06:07:19.368 --> 06:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation so now you've got
 
06:07:22.128 --> 06:07:22.138 align:start position:0%
five members and two liaison or do you
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
have seven members
 
06:07:26.750 --> 06:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
we have seven we have seven members okay
 
06:07:28.670 --> 06:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
so the two liaison it's still a
 
06:07:31.910 --> 06:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
seven-member board that's going to come
 
06:07:33.708 --> 06:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
in with a recommendation so that makes
 
06:07:37.310 --> 06:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
it even more reason to do this take this
 
06:07:39.170 --> 06:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
action there's still seven members
 
06:07:41.390 --> 06:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the budget yes thank you Mr
 
06:07:45.470 --> 06:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
06:07:49.788 --> 06:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:07:52.788 --> 06:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
um before I close the hearing gentlemen
 
06:07:55.310 --> 06:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
you are going to work on clarifying some
 
06:07:57.708 --> 06:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
of the language
 
06:08:00.770 --> 06:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
excellent very good uh take your time on
 
06:08:02.810 --> 06:08:02.820 align:start position:0%

06:08:06.590 --> 06:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:08:09.770 --> 06:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
any other question any other speakers I
 
06:08:11.690 --> 06:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
see none
 
06:08:15.770 --> 06:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
so we'll close the hearing on HB 123 we
 
06:08:17.868 --> 06:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
had uh
 
06:08:23.090 --> 06:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:23.100 --> 06:08:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:08:37.368 --> 06:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
Republicans before you leave today could
 
06:08:39.230 --> 06:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
you give us about five more minutes and
 
06:08:42.170 --> 06:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
we'd ask that the Democrats give us the
 
06:08:44.810 --> 06:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
room here fairly quickly and with that
 
06:09:03.010 --> 06:09:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:05.090 --> 06:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it was my understanding that
 
06:09:07.250 --> 06:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
we're running about an hour
 
06:09:07.260 --> 06:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
we're running about an hour
