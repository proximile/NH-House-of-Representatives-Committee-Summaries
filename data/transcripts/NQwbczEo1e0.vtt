section I'm trying to remember where
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
begins

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
oh he had some definitions and some
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
language regarding which particular
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
schools would be right right this would
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
apply to yeah um because I think part of
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
our original discussion was that um
 
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.550 align:start position:0%
our original discussion was that um
contract

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
negotiations um would have to be
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
involved um in the process um which was
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
not in the original uh bill um that was
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
brought forward um and I know that uh uh
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton had worked on this um
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and she I got a message
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
from her she is on the way she's a few
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
minutes late um but this amendment does
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
address that um and I
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
checked um last week with the
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent baky from
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
gtown and he confirmed that through the
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
reason that he uh was interested in this
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
um legislation and had approached
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander was because he
 
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
did um try to go the union negotiation
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
route um but um received um there's
 
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.189 align:start position:0%
route um but um received um there's
attorney

00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
attorney
Fenton

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
Fenton
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
um uh did not receive a favorable
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
response to entering negotiations to all
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
um the uh more frequent background
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
checks um and was cited that there was
 
00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
nothing in statute um about more
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
frequent background checks so that was
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
the reason that he um put forward um
 
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.790 align:start position:0%
the reason that he um put forward um
this

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
amendment um uh attorney Fenton would
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
you like to talk about the amendment um
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative Al alander sent it to us
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
um the other day and um it was just read
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:57.749 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:24.829 align:start position:0%
 
on

00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
um so attorney Fenton um while hard I
 
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
are being made um as I think I mentioned
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Alexander did email
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment to us and um uh I was just
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if uh you would like to I
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
minutes late I was in a meeting with
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%

good morning thank you for uh your time
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
at the last hearing I want to make clear
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
um it was brought to my attention that I
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
my testimony was interpreted as being
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
against the bill and I want to be clear
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh with this committee that as a state
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
employee I am not here to express an
 
00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
opinion for or against a bill um that
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
I'm only here to provide technical
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
assistance I'm not a political appointee
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
um and so if my testimony was uh receive
 
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
that way I do apologize I was just here
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
to to provide information I was asked uh
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
by the sponsor and the superintendent
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
who um was interested in bringing this
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
bill forward if I could redraft it and I
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
I did I put some words together that I
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
thought addressed his concern
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
18913a it's earlier in the chapter and
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
it simply allows for the superintendent
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
to enter into that negotiation as I
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
testified last time it really has
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
nothing no impact on the Department of
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
Education um it's simply a matter of
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
employment has nothing to do with what
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
the department oversees but I know there
 
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
were a lot of questions last time I'm
 
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them the best to the
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.110 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um in
Your

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
Your
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
Capacity in working with the Department
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
how many incidents have you come across
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
problem thank you for the question and a
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
particular well how many how many times
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
if you had a superintendent contact you
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
with this with this
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
issue expressing a desire to do uh a
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
more frequent background check truly a
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
very small handful less than five I
 
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
would say and those are just all
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotal examples now thank you
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh if there is a
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
problem with it's just a followup if
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with an employee
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
employee you know they get arrested or
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
whatever the situ isn't it isn't there
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
current law that mandates a a
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
recognition or at least a report of that
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
incident so if someone is arrested for
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
one of the disqualifying offenses have
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
set out in statute um under the code of
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
conduct they have to report it to their
 
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent yes so if I had had a um
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
another followup excuse me uh so if I
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
had been been a senior employee and been
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
there for 20 years and uh I did
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
something that would violate the code
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
Etc uh it would mandate that that notice
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
would then have to be given correct it
 
00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:14.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't get pushed under the rug or
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
anything like that so I'll just clarify
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
your example if I may yes if you were a
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
longterm employee at a school district
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
and you were arrested for one of the
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses you would be
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
required to report that to the
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent there could be additional
 
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.789 align:start position:0%
superintendent there could be additional
school

00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
policy which would require you to report
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
any type of arrest I suppose that would
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
be possible but that would be a local
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
policy issue so what when the
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
superintendent was here before us
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
earlier this
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
session he was concerned about I think
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
particularly those senior
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
employees that uh were there prior to
 
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
his being hired as I recall and he was
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
just he was concerned about the ability
 
00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:04.039 align:start position:0%
to have another background check is that
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
necessary if in fact the when you're
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
initially employed there is a background
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
check that's made correct that is
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
correct yes uh so um what would be the
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
incident rate I mean what would be the
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
reason for wanting to have another one
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
just because as a superintendent well
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
you know Mel's been here for SE several
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
years I want to check him out well let
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
me clarify my answer a little bit
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
under the law as it stands now RSA 18
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
18913a upon employment there is a
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
background check I cannot speak to what
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
the law was 20 years ago when someone
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
reason this is not a bill the department
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
has requested to be brought forward I
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to testify as to the
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
why someone else wanted to bring this
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
bill forward I think my role here is
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat limited um I can answer some
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
technical questions I can testify as to
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
why I wrote what I wrote um but again
 
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of someone else I
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
think the intent the desire if you will
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
was simply to have the flexibility
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps to work that into a negotiation
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to go any further in
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
my testimony than
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
this thank you as I read this language
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
would you say that this is permissive
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
language enabling
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
language give me one second to have my
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
exactly my thought when I wrote this was
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
to make
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
it a local control issue first and
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
foremost absolutely 100% falling within
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
the realm of employment nothing to do
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education and to
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
make it permissible only not a mandate
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
in any sense of the word um the the
 
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
thought was to leave an enormous amount
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
of flexibility to the local districts to
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
enter into this negotiation with the
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
Union if they would like to do so as you
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
can see I think these are very uh broad
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
parameters the department did not craft
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
anything that gets into a lot of
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
detail that was the intent that was
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
expressed to me and that's what I tried
 
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
to capture here again keeping in mind I
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
play a unique role here this is not a
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
department issued bill this was just a
 
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.029 align:start position:0%
department issued bill this was just a
request

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you um any further
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
you I had a note from the initial
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
discussion about this bill that's not
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
regarding whether this only applies to
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
groups of employees or whether it could
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
individual yeah thank you for the
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
question that was certainly a concern
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
that I echoed at my prior
 
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and I think the the bill that
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
was previously before this
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
committee I think there was some
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
potential for that
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
um the way I crafted this my My Hope was
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
to make it as I previously testified to
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
an exclusive local control issue that
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
they could negotiate out so they could
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
address those
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
concerns I share your concern that this
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
allowance if you will could be used to
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
Target an individual I don't think
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
anyone has express that to me and I
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
would be remiss if we saw it used that
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
way so I wanted to craft it very broadly
 
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
to allow for those local negotiations to
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
occur so that at the local level they
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
could make sure that that didn't occur
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
they could make sure that it was broadly
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
individual I appreciate your explanation
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
of the intent of what was crafted makes
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
sense and I
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
still kind of wonder if it would be
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
better if it's specifically said
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of nothing in
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
this law shall be used to require an
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
individual to have a records check
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
distinct from the group calendar or
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
slots I would not be opposed to that I
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
certainly think that is well within this
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
committee's decision to add in that
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
additional language I think what I have
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
created is really a
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
framework and within that framework
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
could you add
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
those pieces that you feel would add
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
protection yes that's certainly within
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
the realm of this committee to do so
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
um I think the way that it is crafted I
 
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
trust the negotiations at the local
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
level to address those concerns but
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
certainly this legis it is well within
 
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
this legislative body's uh prerogative
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.549 align:start position:0%
 
those

00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
representative Luna thank you very much
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and uh and and and thanks um
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
Diana for uh for being here but and also
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
for um for uh sending over the uh the
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
draft amendment in um in reading it um
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
is would would this sort of you know
 
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.470 align:start position:0%
is would would this sort of you know
secondary

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
secondary
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
um or more more frequent um check of
 
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.149 align:start position:0%
um or more more frequent um check of
criminal

00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
history only apply to um um employees or
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
units the appropriate application of
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
because it's to be negotiated at the
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
local level so it would in the only
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
apply to those individuals who are in
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
that negotiating unit yes okay so follow
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
up on that so so it it wouldn't apply to
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
let's say um uh an office manager in a
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
public school who may not be a member of
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
the um the teachers or support staff
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
Union some are some aren't and it
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to the director of
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
student services who operates under a um
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
um a a a directly I mean that you know
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
the director of student services
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
typically will have a an employee
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
contract but that would be a one-on-one
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
negotiator with the superintendent in
 
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.549 align:start position:0%
 
board

00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
okay I whole idea was to allow that
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
local level negotiation to occur and to
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
have those individuals who would be
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
subject to this additional background
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
check have a voice in that with your
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
union but and just just a final question
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
on on this string um and and so it would
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
it would not permit the um the the
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
superintendent or head of school to to
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
make um more frequent background checks
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
a condition of employment other
 
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
than as a condition of employment for a
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
an employee who is a member of a
 
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining unit or has a
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
contract as a result of that collective
 
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.510 align:start position:0%
contract as a result of that collective
bargaining

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.389 align:start position:0%
bargaining
unit

00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
I think as I'm puzzling this out a
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
little bit if we look at the reason
 
00:27:37.399 --> 00:27:38.950 align:start position:0%
little bit if we look at the reason
super

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
super
 
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.909 align:start position:0%
super
don't

00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
reason feel that they don't have the
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
ability to run a background
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
check after that initi and so this is
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
that permissive language that they are
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
required to have the department of
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
safety cannot disseminate the federal
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
background check without statutory
 
00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:04.590 align:start position:0%
background check without statutory
enabling

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
ised don't think it would be broader
 
00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:21.559 align:start position:0%
than that um because again you have a
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
few layers of protection this talks
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
about the respective Union for that uh
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
particular district and then the
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
department of safety can't disseminate
 
00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.669 align:start position:0%
department of safety can't disseminate
the

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
record without this enabling language
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
which again I think is narrowly tailored
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
to just that group of people who are
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
represented so so the re reason I'm
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
bringing this up Mr chair and and and
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
and Miss Hunton is because like for
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
example the um the the the
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
school that serves the largest number of
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
public school students in the state
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
by far M um I don't believe has
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining so this wouldn't
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
even apply in in the situation of a
 
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
school that
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
employs and you know and I'm you know by
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
virtue of the number of students that
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
they serve probably more teachers than
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
any other school in New
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I guess I'm you know I'm
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
sorry I was a few minutes late but I'm
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is such a big problem
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
I would think it would certainly be a
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
at a larger school as opposed to a
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
smaller school and this wouldn't even
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
apply to the largest school in the
 
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:41.559 align:start position:0%
state and with all due respect I'm not
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
sure if there's a question there but I
 
00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:44.919 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
from this is very narrowly
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
would

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
langu um and I again want to be clear in
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
my testimony this is not a department
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
sponsored bill this is not a request the
 
00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:05.470 align:start position:0%
sponsored bill this is not a request the
department

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and the department has no opinion as
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
to PR on this bill but this
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
committee this committee had a lot of
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions I was happy to try to bring
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
something before this committee that
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
might be palatable it is certainly
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
within this committee's discretion to to
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
um the superintendent Association is not
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
here to talk about this bill I don't
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
know how far-reaching this is I know
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
what I was asked to do and I brought it
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
forward to to see if this could gain
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
some traction to see if it could address
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
concerns um and I think your point is
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
well taken it's it's not supposed to be
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
broad-based it's supposed to be very
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored as was requested just
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
that ability that was what was expressed
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
to me give the superintendent the
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
ability to enter into that negotiation
 
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
with the Union I think that's what this
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
bill addresses or at least that was
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
certainly my intent does it address all
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
the corresponding issues that could come
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
from that I don't think it does that's
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
do um if I any other questions of
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton um if I could just I do
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
have one
 
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
okay good morning good morning um you
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
you you spoke just very briefly just now
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
that this appears to be a singular issue
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
gtown you don't know where the other
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
super the superintendent Association is
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
on this um so that's my first concern is
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
it wise for us to build legislation
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
around a singular District or should we
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
doing something that's applicable
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide and secondly I have the
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
question are there any employees within
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
school districts that you know of
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
whether they're certificated or not that
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
require more than one criminal
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
background check other than the initial
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
For Hire what about school bus drivers
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
um well can you just ask that do you
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
know if any other employees that require
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
yeah um no off the top of my head I mean
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
the way the statute is written for
 
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
purposes of
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
employment a criminal background check
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
is done on at the time of employment and
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's for contractors that's for
 
00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:56.029 align:start position:0%
that's for contractors that's for
certified

00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.669 align:start position:0%
certified
educators

00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
educators
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
custodians School Personnel across the
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
board uh even volunteers they're subject
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
designated volunteers are subject to the
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
same level of background check um with
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
newer Educators they are now getting a
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
background check upon licensing because
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
the department does not want to license
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
someone who might be
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
unemployable and then they go into
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
employment and that background check at
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
the employment level can be more
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
thorough it goes beyond the
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offense
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
um and so to answer your question in
 
00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
that way yes now there is that
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
two-tiered approach of background checks
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
but for employment purposes I can't
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
think of a group of individuals who are
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
subject to more than one background
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
check upon employment thank
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
you um with as as you just said with the
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
employment background check um it's more
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive so you get to see
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors corre um Etc um and what
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here would be an
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
employment check rather than a a
 
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
licensing background check criminal
 
00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.079 align:start position:0%
record check so so if that initial
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
employment uh check is done only at the
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh initial certification additional
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
licensing um there could be U
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors um that uh um a person
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
would be convicted of um over the years
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
that um a uh superintendent or a
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
district might consider um
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
questionable um based on uh that
 
00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
person's status and the nature of the
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um over the years um and
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
those things would not be caught
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily at this point is is that
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
correct that is it seems to be going off
 
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
periodically uh
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
that is correct and if I may
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
explain the background check that is
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
done currently by the Department of
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
Education is only for those
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses anything that
 
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
would make someone unemployable by
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
Statute the Department's policy
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
is the department does not want to
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
license an individual who is statutorily
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
unemployable in our schools that being
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
said when we pivot away from lure and we
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
look at employment
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli is correct
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
school districts by Statute are allowed
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
to be much broader in their discretion
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
they are still subject to the
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses as is the
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
department but they can create a policy
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
that allows them to account for anything
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
that is found in that criminal
 
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
record the other important piece for
 
00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
this legislature uh legislative
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee to consider is to recognize
 
00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.190 align:start position:0%
committee to consider is to recognize
that

00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
18913a has been changed dramatically
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
over the past eight or nine
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
years and 10 years ago school districts
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
were not receiving criminal records 10
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
years ago school districts were not
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
subject to this information 10 years ago
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm using that number broadly but
 
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's a good
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
Milestone 10 years ago it was the
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety that would read
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
through an applicant's criminal record
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
and they would then send a letter to the
 
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
school district and say and it was a
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
binary option yes you can hire no you
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
cannot and so as this legislative
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee considers this uh bill before
 
00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599 align:start position:0%
it I think it's important to keep in
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
mind that the nature of criminal history
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
checks has changed dramatically so
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
people who were employed 20 years ago
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
were subject to a very different
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
analysis than individuals who are hired
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
today or even three years ago this
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
legislative body has made dramatic
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
changes in this area of the
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
law if I could follow up so for an
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
employe for an employee um who was hired
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
10 15 even 20 years ago um the statute
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
has changed in terms of offenses and
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses Etc which
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
probably or possibly could not have been
 
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
caught back on the initial uh criminal
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
record check um but this would allow
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
through a negotiation process to do a
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
new background
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
check um and possibly look at what is
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
now a disqualifying offense would that
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
be the case yes and one more followup um
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
I think you you just brought it up a
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
minute ago in that
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
um in this District um if the union had
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
agreed to negotiate more frequent
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
background checks um that would have um
 
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
been one step forward but because there
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
was no language in
 
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
statute they could not get the FBI data
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Public Safety is
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
that also correct that is correct the
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
department of safety cannot disseminate
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
the federal background check to a school
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
district or to the Department of
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
Education for that matter without
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
enabling statutory language simply put
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
it has to be in the book it has to be
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
allowed for for do Department of Safety
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
to then disseminate that record to a to
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
a governmental entity I.E a school
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
district or state agency so the real
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
this enabling or um uh permissible uh
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
language is to allow for the district to
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
get that FBI
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
language to receive the record yes yes
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
yeah represent Miler uh what's the
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
what's the feed for running
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
record check now oh gosh
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to Ballpark it and it
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
really is a ballpark
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
$50 and I think there is language in the
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
statute currently that says the school
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
district uh may require the individual
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
to pay that or the school district uh
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
picks up that cost and each district
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
determination yes repr thanks very much
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
and and follow on to to that if um uh if
 
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.030 align:start position:0%
and and follow on to to that if um uh if
an

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
employee actually let me let me back it
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
up further than that if an individual
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to contact the department of
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
safety and get of an FBI background
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
criminal history check on themselves
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
could they pay $50 and do that and then
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
get the report directly from the you
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.430 align:start position:0%
 
safety

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
you the answer is I don't know there's
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
been mixed information on that the FBI
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
department um my understanding is that
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
there are regulations by the FBI that
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
would prited I use myself as an example
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
from contacting the FBI and hey I want
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
to take a look at my own record here's
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
money I could beong
 
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.990 align:start position:0%
money I could beong
don't

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:41:21.309 --> 00:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
understand the reason it came up and the
 
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
reason I struggled with is if you
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
take if you take a private contractor
 
00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.030 align:start position:0%
take if you take a private contractor
for

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
example Diana's janitorial
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
services that is a non governmental
 
00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
entity they're not subject they cannot
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
receive the FBI background check they
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
can get the New Hampshire background
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
check I can go on to the New Hampshire
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
portal and type in my name or type in my
 
00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
neighbor's name and receive their New
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire criminal record but that is
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
limited to the state of New
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so when we saw all these
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
various changes occurring in
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
18913a part of the driving Factor
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative luno was the recognition
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
that a private company I.E Diana's
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
janitorial services can't receive the
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
full background check they can't get the
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
federal background check but the
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can because it
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
is a governmental entity
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
SAU one can because it is a governmental
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
entity we saw this with Brewster
 
00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:35.079 align:start position:0%
Academy and all nonpublic sorry to pick
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
on Brewster Academy but Brewster Academy
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
is not a governmental entity and it
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
check we worked with the feds to get
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
them an exception under the Adam wal
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
Shack because it is a child safety issue
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.670 align:start position:0%
Shack because it is a child safety issue
so

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's how I have become aware of some
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
of those regulations which would
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
prohibit individuals from just calling
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
up and and receiving it because if that
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
was the solution we could say to all the
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
individual contractors just call the FBI
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
directly and request it it is an issue
 
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.270 align:start position:0%
directly and request it it is an issue
of

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:17.549 --> 00:43:17.559 align:start position:0%
dissemination and that's what the FBI is
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about and again I'm not here
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
to speak on behalf of the FBI that's my
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
understanding just a just a quick follow
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
up on on that well it may not be quick
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for the war so so well the
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
followup but the answer may be the the
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
um so this exception
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
for non-government entities that you
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
were just talking about what does that
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
apply to the exception is just under the
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
Adam Walsh act and that was just
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
for those non-public
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
schools to have access to the federal
 
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:55.559 align:start position:0%
background check but that's not
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily applicable
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
to but but the they would have access to
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
the federal background check through the
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education because they can
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
only I thought you said they can only
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
disseminate to a government they can
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
only disseminate to a governmental
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
entity or another entity that is allowed
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
under the adom wall sha okay all right
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
and a good example of the Adam Walsh act
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
putting aside the non-public schools um
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
like a camp any program that works
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
exclusively with children my
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
understanding my limited understanding
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
of the Adam Walsh Act is it is that
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
child safety exception and and and the I
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
knew there was a reason I was was asking
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
this can they do that on an annual or
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
fre or more frequent basis or only on
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
the only as a condition prior to hiring
 
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.710 align:start position:0%
the only as a condition prior to hiring
the

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
employee my understanding is the way the
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
law is written it is upon employment
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
only I do not believe it would be
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
allowed for a reoccurring basis okay but
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
again I'm getting pushed out of my
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
comfort zone a little bit so I'm going
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
to put an asterisk next to that
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
testimony um because I'm I don't work
 
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
for the FBI I don't know all their regs
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
it is really a cursory understanding and
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
I don't want to mislead you in anyway
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
fair enough that is my understanding
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
thanks very much represent
 
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
L maybe I can push you back into your
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
comfort zone here that would be great on
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
lines 20 and 21 you speak about the
 
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the school
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
administrative unit or the chief
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
executive officer but in lines 20 on
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
line 23 you only speak of the
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent um is there a is that a
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh the second line should it read or
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
like you have up top where there may not
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
be a superintendent in a charter school
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
yes that's simply a typo where you left
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
out the four four words five words okay
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
secondly um If This Were to
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
pass uh Are We Now setting up a
 
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.309 align:start position:0%
pass uh Are We Now setting up a
situation

00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
where you have some districts that are
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
not able to do this there is no Union
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
and those that are which have a union is
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
Peter going to start coming after Paul
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
and say Hey you can do it so why can't I
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
do it as a superintendent or chief
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
administrative officer um should we if
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing something like this should
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
we make it then uh more Statewide to
 
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
involve all districts but we're only
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
involving those districts are union
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
districts that's the
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
question and there's two question you
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
if it is this legislature legislative
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
body's intent to have it applicable to
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
all districts then this language that is
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
suffice it's really a policy
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
determination to say if it's going to be
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
applicable to all or to defer to local
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
control and uh that would be beyond the
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
scope of my
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
testimony okay I'll follow that up if I
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
may then so the intent or the rational
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
behind this is for a superintendent to
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
address an issue which he feels or she
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
feels that's necessary wouldn't that
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
same situation might that same situation
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
occur in some other District that didn't
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
union the answer to both your questions
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
is yes
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for attorney
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
Fenton represent Miler well Rick raises
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
an interesting issue for me and and that
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
is if there's an
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
occurred that would need a record check
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
or something isn't there some other form
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
of discipline or prog or Progressive
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
nature of
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
discipline that would address this or
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
even fall under the uh code of conduct
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
that would trigger this kind of a thing
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
I mean I just I'm just concerned about
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
this law of enacting a piece of
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
legislation kind of what Rick was saying
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
earlier where you have one
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent who's come forward i' I
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
got a problem here and then all of a
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
sudden everything so my question is
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me the question is is there if
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
there is an incident that would cause
 
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.349 align:start position:0%
there is an incident that would cause
some

00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
concern isn't there aren't there other
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
factors that a superintendent could
 
00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
follow rather than having the necessar
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:49:04.510 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to push back on your question
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
just slightly simply because you're
 
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
making it targeted at an
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
individual and that's not what this
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
legislation was designed to do this
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
legislation if used in accordance with
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
his intent would be more
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
broad-based and shouldn't be used
 
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
to address as you say a a problem with
 
00:49:29.319 --> 00:49:30.430 align:start position:0%
to address as you say a a problem with
an

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
individual that was certainly not my
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
thought when when I spoke to the
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's not what was
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
conveyed to me and that's not the
 
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
purpose behind this as far as I
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
understood it to be so I push back only
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
because I think you're talking about a
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
particular fact pattern and an
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
individual whereas this is not intended
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
to be applied that way I hope that helps
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
thank you I like to follow sure and I'll
 
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
follow up on represent where we were
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
just now uh dealing with the issue of
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
broad base but this legislation is
 
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
allowing the local school district to
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
decide this employment issue uh whether
 
00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
it's targeted towards an individual or a
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
broad base it's going to be determined
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
by that negotiation so when we say that
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh but this is not necessarily broad
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
base um we don't
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
know you're you're right I I would
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
certainly hope that you know what was
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
expressed to me was not a desire to say
 
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
well there's a problem I need to conduct
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
another background check on on Diana
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
Fenton problem employee the the thought
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
was I want to as a superintendent be
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
able to negotiate this possibility with
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
the Union not to say well now I need it
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
as a tool and now I want to administer
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
this and so it was to put it as part of
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations along with a whole
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
host of other
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
superintendent utilize it in those
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations I suppose they
 
00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:12.710 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations I suppose they
could

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
but and I will defer to the union to
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
testify to this but my understanding is
 
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
when you have those contract
 
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
negotiations they are more broad-based
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
more broad arching it's not about an
 
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
individual and and again that's just my
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of it so I would be
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
surprised if this was to be used
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
to address a grievance with one
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
particular individual that's not what
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
was expressed to me when I spoke with
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and again limited
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge base but that's that is the
 
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
spirit in which I drafted this amendment
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it is certainly within the purview
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
of this committee to make mod I'm
 
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat concerned about where we're
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
going with this um if I'm the the
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
teacher on a playground a given an
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
analogy here and there's a individual
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
screwing up on the
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
yard do I line the whole playground kids
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
up on the wall or the one kid that's
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
screwing up on the
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
wall um it seems to me whether if if
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
this if the effort behind all this is to
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
deal with an individual this is the
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
wrong way to do it we're passing some
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
legislation that's a blanket for groups
 
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
what have you
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
rather than dealing with the specific
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
issue so I I I'm a little bit perplexed
 
00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:34.839 align:start position:0%
as to where we're going with this in
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
terms of what is the initial intent and
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this what is the end of
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
this what's that Endzone look like where
 
00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:46.839 align:start position:0%
are we going and
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
why my understanding of the spirit of
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
this proposal was that it was supposed
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
to be proactive in nature not reactive
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
I think the state government is Infamous
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
for being reactive and not proactive and
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
the thought from the superintendent and
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
again it's difficult to testify on
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
someone else's behalf
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
but the thought that as a superintendent
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
I want the ability to negotiate this and
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
it might not come to fruition I might
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
not be successful in those
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
negotiations that's part of the nature
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
of negotiations and that's fair game but
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
I want to have it as a bargaining chip
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
because I want to be able to subject
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
School Employees who are covered by the
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
union so that I make sure that they are
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
safe for lack of a better term and again
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
I'm stepping outside of my role here but
 
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
I can imagine from a superintendent's
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
position give me the tools to ensure
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
that these children are
 
00:53:45.549 --> 00:53:45.559 align:start position:0%
safe give me that tool or at least give
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
me the opportunity to negotiate for it
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that is what is being asked
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
but again I put a big asteris by that
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
testimony because I'm not a superintend
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
attendant I'm not a
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
lobbyist I was asked to draft this I
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
drafted it and here we are having a
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
great time talking about it but
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
um I think that's really the decision
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
this legislative committee has to has to
 
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
consider I think it is being asked as a
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
tool I don't think it's being used to
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
Target anyone individual and I would be
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
very remiss if it was used in that way
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
can I have one last thank you so
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
is your impression that this is you talk
 
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.549 align:start position:0%
is your impression that this is you talk
about

00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:29.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
proactive is this really proactive if it
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
were proactive what it not come from the
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent Association School boards
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
Association and the various associations
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
are representing Educators out in the
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
field but this is not this is coming
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
individual I think that is a very fair
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
concern to to bring up again I can't
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
speak for those other groups I I don't
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
know who has vetted this legislation in
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
terms of those other organizations and
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
they're certainly free to uh attend
 
00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
these hearings and and speak as to their
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I'm not in a
 
00:55:08.349 --> 00:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
position to say
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
that further questions for attorney
 
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
Fenton you seen none thank you very much
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's it yeah well we've got more bills
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
so so stick
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
around thank you very much um any other
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
conversation with the subcommittee
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think um yes yeah I just have a a
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
comment um chairman lad um I think our
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
duty as legislators is to listen to
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
constituents and not just Union
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
representation and we had a constituent
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
who also happens to be a superintendent
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
bring this legislation forward um so I
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily think he was being
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
reactive I thought he was being
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
proactive in trying to prevent future
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
situations like this from occurring
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
sure our responsibility here as an
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
education committee we represent
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
education in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in one specific district
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
and it's important that when we enact we
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
enact legislation it's appropo or
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
applicable to all districts and have
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
intent and rationale behind why we're
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
doing it uh I'm not negating what's
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
going on particularly in gtown but there
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
there's a process which we have to
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
follow but also that the superintendent
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
should be following and working
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
collectively together they bring forward
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
and Su of the so does the school boards
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
Association recommended policies which
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
they're working towards in any given
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
year they share that with us and then we
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
go forward if we react to every singular
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
issue that comes our statutes are going
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
to be much much larger than what we
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily see you know we see the
 
00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:56.200 align:start position:0%
green book that representative Tanner
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
was wanting to see every year we're
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
going to have to be carrying around you
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
know a cart pulling all this stuff so I
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
I I'm concerned that we we en enact
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that is really necessary and
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
rather than creating something here
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
which this is going to lead to another
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation because it's going
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
to be applicable only to certain
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
districts so it's lining up for more
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
legislation in fact let's do it right
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
when we initially do it thank
 
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
you I followup followup yes I I do agree
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
with that I don't necessarily think that
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
this is the particular vehicle with
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
which to but I think it did open up um
 
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
an area which does need some attention
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
paid to it and so I would thank that
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent for bringing this forward
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
because it did bring this discussion to
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
our attention I can respond to that too
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
as an administrator I've been in
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
situations like this however um I I it
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
this this issue is
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
a broad issue targeted or for whole
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
groups uh one District vers another
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
District whether you have a union or not
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
there are just too many Loose Ends Here
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh there is uh something behind it yes
 
00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
that's maybe we need to be looking at
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
and and working collectively with uh a
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
broader range of folks to get something
 
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
done that's going to be more lasting in
 
00:58:21.309 --> 00:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
nature veror
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
Damon thank
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
you I think I have three
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
thoughts one is it keeps sticking in my
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
head attorney Fenton's observation that
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
this statute has changed a lot since 10
 
00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:36.390 align:start position:0%
this statute has changed a lot since 10
years

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.950 align:start position:0%
years
ago

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
and it has raised my
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
concern that in fact we might not know
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
the background of people who are
 
00:58:50.029 --> 00:58:50.039 align:start position:0%
hired long enough ago that the current
 
00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
criminal records checks didn't apply to
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
them so that I think is something
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
to perhaps as chair lad said consider in
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
What legislation might look like I mean
 
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
I think we could amend this bill to
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
include the broader array that has been
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
referred to not just the public
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
schools and I've now forgotten my third
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
piece oops I'll stop there until it
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
comes back thank you um thank you I I
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh I think that um before November 13th
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
it is our full committee meeting um you
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
know as you've got your third point I
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
did go ahead it seems that we could ask
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
the professional associations that we
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
don't know what they think we could ask
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
them to tell us what they
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
think thank you um I think there can be
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
um between now and the 13th additional
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
looking at this language and possibly
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
other language to address some of the
 
01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
concerns but um uh I also think that it
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
has um raised an issue um representative
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
Damon you just mentioned one in terms of
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
the length of time after that initial
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
employment check um and the fact that um
 
01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
without statutory language if and if a
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
district did negotiate uh further
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
background checks um they could not get
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
the full set of information because it's
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
not in in statute um so I think that's
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh for me that's an important point also
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
and um you know I um you know we'll try
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
and find some time to uh you know play
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
around with the language a little bit
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
myself and hopefully uh others might
 
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
worthwhile anything well I I just think
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
that there there's none of our
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
associations and none of those non uh
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
folks which are not in Associates that
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
don't don't all want safety in our
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
schools and and and they have uh you
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
know folks in their schools which are
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be around children I
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
think we all agree on that uh so I think
 
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
this is something we shouldn't let go
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
but uh it you're right representative
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
cordelli it does you know maybe
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
something can be crafted uh however if
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
we do so I think we have to do it with
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
support of of all people that are coming
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
in contact with these
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
children okay thank you um I guess with
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
that we'll we'll close
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
on this bill uh 267 for today and um
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
we'll be revisiting it um and we have
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
another uh Bill uh to address during
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
this set of um bills um and that is
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
628 which requires certain non Public
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
Schools or educational service providers
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
that accept public funds to perform
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
background checks on all employees and
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers um and um I think
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative Miler you had something
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
you wanted to pass out and and uh I do
 
01:02:09.279 --> 01:02:23.349 align:start position:0%
you wanted to pass out and and uh I do
as

01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:47.630 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:03:23.230 align:start position:0%
 
me

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
sure we can take take a few minutes to
 
01:03:25.799 --> 01:03:34.910 align:start position:0%
sure we can take take a few minutes to
uh

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes so we'll we'll take a few minutes
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
breaks anyway in between um five minutes
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
and uh we can look over this
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
material okay
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
sure uh do you want to
 
01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:52.349 align:start position:0%
sure uh do you want to
start

01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
unforunately is down uh with a very
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
difficult cold at this point in time so
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
she was she's unable to be here her uh
 
01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
the intent of her amendment to her bill
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
is to eliminate uh any uh thought that
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
the homeschooled parents would not have
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
to go through a background check that's
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
basically what she was trying to do with
 
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.029 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
and what BR pass out information from
 
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.390 align:start position:0%
and what BR pass out information from
several

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
several
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
organizations in terms of their
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
background check policy um one is from
 
01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.069 align:start position:0%
background check policy um one is from
um

01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
prena um there is another from uh David

01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%

policies um so we can take a few minutes
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.079 --> 01:06:52.990 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%

just

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%

okay

01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
are we okay to um everyone had enough
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
time to read through these materials
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:10:21.189 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.199 --> 01:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
that's
you

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:12:04.229 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
everybody good to
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
go great um shall we um represent Miler
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
first

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:33.669 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
that um homeschool parents would not be
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
this but that but that others who are
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
receiving uh public funds would be uh
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
would be covered under this her her
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:13:01.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
because that was a major concern I think
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
when we talked about before she heard
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
that and wanted to make sure that it was
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
clear that uh this would she thinks this
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
would deal with
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
that uh yes so I just want to make sure
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
I'm in section 3D where it says the
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
section shall not ptain to a parent
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
giving a Nona home education program to
 
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
their children so basically what this is
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
making clear is a parent is not going to
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
be having to get a criminal background
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
check to educate their own children but
 
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
what about these situations in which
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
parents informally come together so
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
which I am becoming more and more
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
familiar with and where a neighbor uh
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
is maybe is better with math and so they
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
get to together in a sort of a informal
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
pod I don't know if that's the correct
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
word would those parents be required
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
to have a background check what I'm
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
becoming more and more familiar with is
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
this idea that you know I used to think
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooling was a parent just teaching
 
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
their kids and what I've learned is that
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's a lot different than that so so
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
just some I don't know if you can give
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
it because it's not your Amendment but I
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
don't want that's what I I take issue
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
with most with this this law this bill
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
is the burden it puts on
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
um parents who other parents know well
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
they have a relationship with they trust
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
and they will be subject to criminal
 
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if this
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
language doesn't address that it just
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
says a parent doesn't have
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
to with their own children doesn't need
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
a background check which don't answer I
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
mean obviously that that should be the
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
case just want to bring that up and if
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
anyone can offer clarification represent
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
Miler or yeah I can I can take it um and
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I think in sections one and sections
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
two which um which address the
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
conditions that would uh would um
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
require a uh uh criminal history records
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
check would not apply in the cases you
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
just mentioned because it doesn't um
 
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about home schooling it
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
talks about specific specific programs
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
to learn everywhere program the
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
program or are other funded program
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
through through a scholarship
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
organization so that would be like the
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
um so so I I think in the situation
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
where you've got um you know a neighbor
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
who's coming over to to teach a
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
homeschooled child music or art or
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
something like that it neither in
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
section one or section two does it
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
person um if I could mention on that
 
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
same section uh section
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
3D um the last
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
this section shall not pertain to a
 
01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
parent giving a non-fa home education
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
program to their children but we do have
 
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
e we do have homeschooled parents with
 
01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.669 align:start position:0%
e we do have homeschooled parents with
EFA

01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
EFA
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
accounts so they would be subject to the
 
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
background check but but those aren't
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
homeschool kids those are EFA kids we've
 
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
we've we we've heard that from the
 
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner that those aren't
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
considered homeschool um those are
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
considered EFA students
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
students but I I don't think that's
 
01:16:59.470 --> 01:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
clear in this in this section I the way
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
I read it is that if a parent is giving
 
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
a non-fa home education program to the
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
children there they don't have to submit
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
the records check but a parent who is
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
giving an um a program to a CH their
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
children with an EFA account they do
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
have to qualify or submit the background
 
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:33.070 align:start position:0%
have to qualify or submit the background
check

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
repres there are there are four ways
 
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
that in our state of New Hampshire that
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance can be uh
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
accomplished one
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
homeschooling EFA public and private
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
those the four links there is a a
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
difference between EFA and homeschooling
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
they are separate programs if you
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
receive an EFA you're part and recorded
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
as an EFA student so I think that should
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
clarify that but I I have a problem on
 
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.470 align:start position:0%
clarify that but I I have a problem on
line

01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
19 where it's talking about the
 
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship organization
 
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
funded programs are you talking is this
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
talking about the education tax credit
 
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
if so those are not government monies
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
those are monies which are tax credit
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
monies from business and they don't go
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
to the state we've had this discussion
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
over and over and over and so I don't
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
want to see any
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
linkage uh for this program applying to
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh students which are receiving solely
 
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
credit so so let me let me um would it
 
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
be acceptable to you if
 
01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
we took out um from the end of line 19
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
or our children scholarship funded
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
programs take out that
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
part and and basically just leave learn
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
everywhere and um um EFA program I I
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
think representative luno that that is a
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
concern and that needs to be struck from
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
this bill should it move forward my
 
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
overarching concern here is
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
that we have a number of private excuse
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
me number of private schools in the
 
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
state which we have students that are
 
01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.110 align:start position:0%
state which we have students that are
tuition

01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
to and they could be anything from uh a
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
a holderness Kimble Union to you know
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
those are private
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
schools and but they could receive
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
tuition students based upon the way we
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
have the tuition program set
 
01:19:45.149 --> 01:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
up uh I'm concerned that we got to be
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
very careful in over regulating private
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
schools if we do so we're going to lose
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
that opportunity for them to receive
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
tuition students they're going to say
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's not worth one or two or
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
three students but every student's
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
important so uh I'm real concerned that
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
we not encroach into private schools
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
that are separate from public they're
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
functioning basically yes they do
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
receive some tuition programs but
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's I I think we got to be very
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
careful if I could just mention in
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
regard to that that um the handouts um
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
that I provided um one of which is from
 
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh prena with their background um check
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
policy um which includes an annual
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
background check for their um
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
instructors um and also from the uh
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
chair of the non-public school um
 
01:20:46.199 --> 01:20:47.430 align:start position:0%
chair of the non-public school um
advisory

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
Council um who really Echoes the same
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
thing that the previous uh chair echoed
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
1999 um to uh excuse me 2019 to Prior
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um that if you're accredited
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
by Nas you have to perform background
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
checks and every school in New Hampshire
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
approved for attendance by the state
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
part of their P part of the process to
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
get approved is that you are going to be
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
performing background checks
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that it um I'll also
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
mention I was pointed out in one of
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
these that um these
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
policies go further than the public
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
school policy and the public school
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
policies um just require background
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
checks for designated volunteers where
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
these um do not have that restriction
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
and volunteers generally um are required
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
to have background
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:53.550 align:start position:0%
to have background
checks

01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
checks
 
01:21:57.149 --> 01:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
yeah re luno thank thanks very much I
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
mean as we as we heard um public school
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
policies require um criminal history
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
background checks the national uh
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
Crystal um FBI criminal history
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
background check for any prospective um
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh new hire so so I I would I would not
 
01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
say that that the example given here in
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
prena goes beyond what our what our
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
public schools um is doing are doing and
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
and I think even even more
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
concerning to
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
me uh you know in reading the U the
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
prena background check policy is it
 
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.189 align:start position:0%
prena background check policy is it
seems

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
seems
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
to conflict with
 
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
um what we just heard on the last bill
 
01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
and and um and I was wondering maybe if
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
um if if attorney Fenton might be able
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
to come up and and um particularly
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
address some of the um some of the
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
points that that prena is um
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
is you know talking about here and uh
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not that um that you know is
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
is actually even possible um uh to
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
happen because we know prena operates
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire we
 
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
know they have employees who are called
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
guides we know they have
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers and we have them saying that
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
they do a federal criminal search in a
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
national criminal search um uh yet they
 
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
um yet we we've heard that the uh
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent in gtown can't uh can't
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
get that information so I so I'm not
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
quite sure why Kenda can get that
 
01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.270 align:start position:0%
quite sure why Kenda can get that
information

01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
um working with public school kids and
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
non public school kids and a
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
superintendent can't get that
 
01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
information it appears to be in
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
Conflict would you like to uh offer
 
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
Fenton so the qu the question would the
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
question would be um
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh would would prena through a um a
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
third-party um private company and they
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
they call it
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
Checker um be able to conduct the the uh
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
Crim the N the the Federal Criminal
 
01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
search they call it here and a national
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
um would they be able to con to to
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
conduct those and um
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
and uh uh do those searches are those
 
01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
searches equivalent to um to what uh
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
what the state of New Hampshire requires
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
for um for um uh for public schools
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
prior to hiring an
 
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.790 align:start position:0%
prior to hiring an
employee

01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
today thank you for the question for the
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
record my name is Diana fent with the
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
Education

01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
Education
 
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
it would be the department of safety who
 
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
could best answer this question so with
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
that caveat in place my again my
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of the
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
system is the federal background check
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
does not get disseminated to
 
01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.790 align:start position:0%
does not get disseminated to
non-governmental

01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
non-governmental
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
entities you referenced a thirdparty
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
background check company those are very
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
common again my my limited understanding
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
is this third-party private vendors cuz
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's what that is it's a part it's a
 
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
private vendor um does not have access
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
to the FBI background check they will do
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
computer searches they'll check public
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
records things of that nature um there
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
could be an exception through the atom
 
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
wall Shack uh by
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
which they are getting that information
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
that federal background check but I
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
don't know that for sure um again this
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
is my cursory understanding of that
 
01:26:29.229 --> 01:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
checks if I could just point out the uh
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
letter from shaa nson um who works for a
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
pra nationally um that they comply with
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
18913a uh five that uh which I think are
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
the um disqualifying offenses right yes
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
can I ask uh sure a question um di if if
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
I'm a school district and I contract
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
with an agency let's say to provide the
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
services that we're looking for whether
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
it be speech or some other
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
area does the
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
agency is that the organization which
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
does the criminal background check um or
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
how's how's this this occurred the the
 
01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
individual that comes out to do this may
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be a speech pathologist
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
it may be somebody doing the job under
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
the supervision of somebody within that
 
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
agency uh how do we know that that
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
individual coming to have oneon-one with
 
01:27:39.199 --> 01:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
individual coming to have oneon-one with
a

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
student um has criminal background
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
check my understanding is it is a
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
function of the school district it will
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
be the school district that will take on
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
that role and run that background check
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
and review it so if a school district's
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
Contracting with the agency to provide
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
that and Mrs Jones shows up today and
 
01:28:07.109 --> 01:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
maybe Mr Smith the next day they have no
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
idea who is
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
coming so how do we ensure that there's
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
criminal background
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
checks is it the agency that's given
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
that check as an
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
individual so again and representative
 
01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
cascaden might have personal experience
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
with this um given her prior role as a
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent I will change your fact
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
pattern briefly and if you take it more
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
broad-based custodial
 
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
Services those background checks are
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
performed by the school
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
district employing those those
 
01:28:42.669 --> 01:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
individuals if you look at it as more
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
those one-on-one Services um it has been
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
problematic for the school district to
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
be able to conduct those background
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
checks because as you said it might be a
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
shif changing nature um those are very
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
fact dependent situations and they are
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
handled on a case-by Case basis by the
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
school district I have spoken to
 
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
superintendents who have grappled with
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
that from time to time um figuring out
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
how best to ensure the safety and comply
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
with the the law but in large part my
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is those private
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
entities do not have that access and the
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
does thank
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
you repr Luna thank you very much Mr

I guess inperson for inperson
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
instruction with a with a public school
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
student um I guess it's two parts of the
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
question what's the uh what's the
 
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
Department's position in in public
 
01:30:07.229 --> 01:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
schools uh Contracting with prenda to
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
provide iners instruction and then
 
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
number two what is the Department's
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
position with respect to criminal
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
history records checks on pra employees
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
and volunteers that provide um in-person
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
C I don't know if I'm able to speak on
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
our position
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
um I can answer technical questions I
 
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'm here to speak as to
 
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
broad-based policy initiatives um well
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
so so so so let me I'll turn it into a
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
technical question then as opposed to a
 
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
policy initiative if um if the um if the
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
hoptman school district was to contract
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
with uh with
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh for a prena pod uh that used both
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
employee guides and volunteers to
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
provide in-person
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
instruction um what would the Hopkinson
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
school board's
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility be in so far as um as a
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
criminal history check on these um on
 
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
Personnel I I would have to look at that
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
contract I really don't I don't know the
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
interplay I do know that for all the
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives the department undertakes we
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
do so keeping in mind that criminal
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
history check is Paramount but I can
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
look into that interplay and get back to
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
I I just don't have okay thanks and that
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
that I think would be a big help and I
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
think you know the the question we're
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
putting putting for that just you know
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
put out here I think it's very similar
 
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
to what what Rick just put out with
 
01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
respect to um you know a contracted
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
occupational therapist
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
service and um that that a school a
 
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
school May contract with you're not
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
quite sure who you're going to get for
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
personnel on any given day but what's
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
the school districts what's the school
 
01:32:05.709 --> 01:32:05.719 align:start position:0%
board's responsibility as far as
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
criminal history check on these um uh on
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
these Personnel who are um uh providing
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
students represent Damon thank you um I
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
have three things to again maybe I'll
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
remember all three so just to clarify
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli on your remark
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
before we brought attorney Fenton
 
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
forward the amendment proposed to the
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
bill does specify designated volunteer
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
the original Bill didn't say designated
 
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
but the amendment does
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
statute y
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
y sorry so so it it is specific to
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
designated volunteer not um in the
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
amendment um my question to to attorney
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
Fenton my screen just close I'm on
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
Checker's website the company that the
 
01:33:02.189 --> 01:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
prena um materials indicate they use and
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
in part it references doing their
 
01:33:07.109 --> 01:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
Federal criminal records check through
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
Pacer which I'm not familiar with the
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
public access to court electronic
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
records can you comment
 
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
on what's available through that similar
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
to the questions that have been asked
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
about you know discussion of the prior
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
Bill information not being just readily
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
available to individuals Is this
 
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
that so I
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
just typed in Pacer as well I'm never
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
I've never explored this website uh
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
you've given me something to do this
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
afternoon um so I thank you very much um
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is you court is an
 
01:33:57.679 --> 01:33:58.870 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is you court is an
open

01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
Forum anyone can walk into any
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
courthouse and listen to the
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
docket um and these are public documents
 
01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
people don't think of them as public
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
documents but if you go into court you
 
01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
can watch a trial you can hear a case
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
and you can hear what the verdict is you
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
can find out if someone's guilty this is
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
why we watch WMUR in the morning and
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
eagerly await where Ray Brewer is in the
 
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
morning before a courthouse they it is
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
public information it is a public record
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
I think what these private companies
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
such as Pacer do and again I I have
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
limited information but this is my
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is they can look up Diana
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
Fenton and individually say in the state
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has she been been
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
convicted of something in Nevada has she
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
been convicted of something and they go
 
01:34:50.109 --> 01:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
through and it's just a constant
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
computer search
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
whereas pivot you can get all that
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
information or pivot and you go to the
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
federal background check and it's all
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
given to you on one paper right and so
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
the information is all
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
obtainable it's just how do you obtain
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
it it's not that it's private it's not
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
confidential it's just there's one
 
01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
entity that compil it as part of their
 
01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.310 align:start position:0%
entity that compil it as part of their
administrative

01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
obligation and then they can disseminate
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
it or I sit here and I type in Hope
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
Damon in all these different capacities
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
and I pull and compile the same
 
01:35:38.669 --> 01:35:38.679 align:start position:0%
information I think that's what you're
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
finding that's what the third party
 
01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.669 align:start position:0%
finding that's what the third party
vendor

01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
does so if I'm understanding you
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
correctly in theory Checker or other
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
companies like them through Pacer could
 
01:35:56.189 --> 01:35:56.199 align:start position:0%
come up with all the information that
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
would be in the FBI record but they
 
01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
would need to be very diligent and
 
01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.390 align:start position:0%
would need to be very diligent and
thorough

01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
thorough
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
to to do that I agree with that
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
statement yes thank you represent Pell
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you sorry the last piece I had
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
is I just wanted to make the observation
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
that regardless of whether we agree or
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
disagree with the adequacy of the prena
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
process prena is by no means the only
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
micropod correct terminology if possible
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh option that is available in New
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so when we look at what we
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
might do with this
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill even if we think what pra is doing
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
is fine and adequate it doesn't cover
 
01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.229 align:start position:0%
is fine and adequate it doesn't cover
that

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:42.239 --> 01:36:44.310 align:start position:0%
that
whole

01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
students p know if we really want to
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
open up a can of worms in both of these
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation if you look
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
further down the page on Checker they
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
have um continuous criminal background
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
checks so you can be alerted anytime
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
there's a reportable offense from your
 
01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:11.750 align:start position:0%
there's a reportable offense from your
active

01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%

questions for attorney Fenton seen none
 
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%

representative it just seems to me that
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
in order for these
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
schools to remain in business they have
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
to provide a level of criminal
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
background checks that will maintain the
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
parents trust case in point well what
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
representative pel just mentioned about
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
that organization but just to draw your
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
attention to the dasis of
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh Robert Dunn and the final
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph of that letter
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
says that uh the dasis of Manchester has
 
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
a robust criminal background check
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
process in place for its School
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
Employees and volunteers he goes into
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
the details and then says the dasis of
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester has instituted these
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
procedures even even without the Mandate
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
that HB 1664 would impose um we don't
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
need this law these schools have to do
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
this in order to stay in business the C
 
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
and I know from personal experience the
 
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools went through a rough
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
time uh enrollment plummeted in order to
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
regain the trust of parents they had to
 
01:38:36.669 --> 01:38:36.679 align:start position:0%
Institute impeccable standards of
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
background checks and they have regained
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
that trust greatly you know you know I I
 
01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
I I just got to stop you right there the
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools went through a tough
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
time how about their students that were
 
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
abused they go through a tough time
 
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
say that this is oh the poor Catholic
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
schools I mean this
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
is this comment right here is just
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
laughable it happens in public schools
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
too so let's not go there what do you
 
01:39:04.589 --> 01:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
mean it's laughable I kind of object to
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
this I'm just trying step back I'm
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
speaking from my own experience having
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
had a lot of experience with Catholic
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
schools as a parent having to go through
 
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
all the hoops and all the watching
 
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
videos and the fingerprints and the
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
what I my point is I'm just using it as
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
an example as PR do in order for these
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
private schools to maintain their
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment to have parents trust they
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
have to do this they that just for that
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
reason and and so do and they do it so
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
they do this without a mandate of a
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
government over overreaching with with
 
01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:45.070 align:start position:0%
government over overreaching with with
more

01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:39:48.109 --> 01:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
regulations um representative
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
p i I have to agree with representative
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
quell because I went through this also
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
and the silver lining in that in this in
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
that Scandal that the Catholic Church
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
went through had repercussions making
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
everybody aware of sexual abuse that can
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
occur any abuse that can occur and I
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
routinely go through training even
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
though I'm not a teacher to stay safe
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
having interactions with youth and I've
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
gone through multiple trainings as as a
 
01:40:22.109 --> 01:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
a coach as a strok and turn judge for
 
01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:26.679 align:start position:0%
swim teams as a soccer parent um and
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
I've seen people regardless of
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
background checks regardless of training
 
01:40:36.669 --> 01:40:36.679 align:start position:0%
still behave as if the rules don't apply
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
to them and if if anything the other
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
letter that we received from Mr tibol
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
from the dicese emphasizes parents being
 
01:40:49.149 --> 01:40:49.159 align:start position:0%
educated and I think that would be the
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
most important takeaway from any of this
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
legislation is that parents seek the
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
education they need to look for these
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
behaviors that they should be alerted to
 
01:40:58.109 --> 01:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
so that they can keep their children
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
safe because regardless of the
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
background checks regardless of as much
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
safety we put
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
Educators volunteers anybody through
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
there are still criminals who will
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
behave in ways that supersede the
 
01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:17.719 align:start position:0%
rules and as we've seen a background
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
check is a snapshot in time you know you
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
can have background check today but what
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
happens on Friday you know is something
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
different um I thought I saw someone
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
else with a hand up um yes
 
01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:32.430 align:start position:0%
else with a hand up um yes
representative

01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
Damon thank
 
01:41:35.199 --> 01:41:37.950 align:start position:0%
Damon thank
you

01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand and I would like
 
01:41:42.239 --> 01:41:44.310 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand and I would like
to

01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
understand if in
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
fact the Catholic schools and various
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
other entities that are being
 
01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
referenced are already so completely
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
thorough in their background checks then
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
why would there be an objection to what
 
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
this bill says because they would
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
already be doing
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
it repres P that's a very good question
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
because we just heard a bill where the
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
public schools have objection to further
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
background checks I'm seeing evidence
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I you you said um prle wasn't the
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
only example but I did see that acting
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
Academy in order to maintain your status
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
as an acting academy you need to perform
 
01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:27.639 align:start position:0%
background checks every four years on
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
your Educators in that in that system we
 
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
have two AC andies in New Hampshire um
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
I'm my question and kind of a rebuttal
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
to your
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
statement is there any specific
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
situation or an example of a situation
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
that makes this legislation necessary
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
the the last bill that we heard there
 
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
was a specific situation that was
 
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:54.679 align:start position:0%
brought forward this one I'm not seeing
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
a specific situation I'm not seeing a
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
specific um organization that is having
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
concerns other than legislators who seem
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
to think it's necessary to attack um
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
recipients of Education Freedom accounts
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
or non um Public Schools um and quite
 
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
honestly has a former homeschooler I see
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
this as an attack by uh the public Ed
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
education system um on families that
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
they want more information from than
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
receiving I would hope that we could
 
01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
find a
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
way to so prioritize the safety of all
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
children regardless of the environment
 
01:43:46.990 --> 01:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
in which they receive
 
01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
education that no one would perceive
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
this as an attack
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
and I come at this as a
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
victim so it deeply deeply troubles me
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
that we would put barriers in the path
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
of doing the best that we
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
can to assure that people who are
 
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
interacting with our children have no
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
criminal record history and yes
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
something could happen tomorrow that's
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely true in any
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:22.109 align:start position:0%
absolutely true in any
context

01:44:22.109 --> 01:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
the majority of perpetrators of harm to
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
children are known to their
 
01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:30.430 align:start position:0%
children are known to their
families

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful responsible well-intended
 
01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
parents don't well-informed parents
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
don't always see it this is just a piece
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
I think both of these bills actually to
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
try to increase the level of safety will
 
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
never be perfect but it's not an attack
 
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
at least that's not at all how I
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
um I I would just say I think that
 
01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:01.719 align:start position:0%
um I see it more of of an attack on
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
myself um and I don't think that as
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen with the documents um about
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
background check policies from various
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
organizations um they are I think
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative perinel you mentioned
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
that they're doing it without a
 
01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
government mandate um they're doing it
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
because of their con concern um for
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
safety um and uh I I think it also leads
 
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
back to to the last bill and um doing
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
something so that uh background checks
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
are not performed um once um in a a
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
teachers uh or Educator's career um and
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
are yes you had to thank you so
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
if the bill currently before
 
01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
us is an attack which
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
I for me it totally is not but if it
 
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
is then the prior bill is also an attack
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
to a different population I mean I don't
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
think we can have it both ways we can
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
either say both bills Endeavor to create
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
a better safety net for
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
children or we can say they're both
 
01:46:21.629 --> 01:46:21.639 align:start position:0%
attacks or they're overreach or for
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
whatever reason we don't support them
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
mean it seems to me it shouldn't matter
 
01:46:28.350 --> 01:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
what context a student is being educated
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
in that they be safe they need to be
 
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
safe no matter
 
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
what I I don't think we can as
 
01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
legislators or parents or anything else
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee safety um you
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
know go go to the playground go you know
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
play at the neighbor's house and you
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
know um we just uh have to hope that uh
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
and pray that they are always safe um
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
but um I just wanted to raise one other
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
question on the amendment um on line
 
01:47:03.149 --> 01:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
11 it requires submission of the
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
who so non-public
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
schools um are going to be required to
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
do background checks and then submit
 
01:47:19.709 --> 01:47:19.719 align:start position:0%
them to the Department of Education or
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
who so um as described under RSA 18913a
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
so so it may be addressed in that I'm
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
not an expert on this bill Glenn but it
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
may be addressed um in that um I I I I
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
was also wondering if if it might be a
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
benefit to to the committee to maybe get
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
a representative from the Department of
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
Safety in here because Glenn you just
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
you just said you know things like well
 
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
prenda is doing it and others are doing
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
it and it would really be good to
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
understand what it is here because the
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire requires um uh
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
employees that are that are that are uh
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
working with our public school students
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
to um to uh to have an FBI criminal
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
records check prior to to employment and
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
if that the standard we should
 
01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
understand if if the the you know the
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
products that are listed here by prena
 
01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
and possibly by others uh are are
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
equivalent to that are the same as that
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
or or somehow different uh than that so
 
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
that we can sort of compare apples
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
whether we're comparing talking about
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples here and um and I think
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
Miss Venton has done a done a tremendous
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
job to try to provide some advice to to
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
this committee uh with respect to the
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
the um uh how the the I guess the um how
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
robust these these various
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
uh criminal records checks are but uh
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know when we when we go from the
 
01:49:09.629 --> 01:49:09.639 align:start position:0%
statute and what we've heard in
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
testimony before and then we go to the
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
Pena letter we're seeing different terms
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
here we're seeing terms like Federal
 
01:49:18.430 --> 01:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
Criminal search and a national criminal
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
search um
 
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
whether that's the same as an FBI
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
criminal history records check I don't
 
01:49:27.950 --> 01:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
know and and U maybe there's somebody
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety that can
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
that can help advise this committee on
 
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
what the FBI does and what um what some
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the the third parties like Checker
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
and others that have um uh been
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
discussed what what products they
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
provide uh and and what level of safety
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
um uh or at least what level of um of of
 
01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
assurance they're um they're providing
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
the entities that are requesting these
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
um history checks thank you
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative lad thank you very much
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair um I I think we've got to be
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
very careful we're not going to compare
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
what we're doing right here in 628 to
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
what we were just looking at in
 
01:50:14.669 --> 01:50:14.679 align:start position:0%
267 we're talking about separate areas
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
of statutory
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
language in the one we just dealt with
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
267 we're talking about
 
01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:25.030 align:start position:0%
267 we're talking about
18913a

01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
18913a
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
1A if you were to look at that statutory
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
language in
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
1B which we haven't even focused on it
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
specifically says a nonpublic school may
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
elect to require criminal records check
 
01:50:46.069 --> 01:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
on selected employees so 1B talks to the
 
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
non-public this right we have right here
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
in 628 it's also talking about
 
01:50:53.199 --> 01:50:54.750 align:start position:0%
in 628 it's also talking about
nonpublic

01:50:54.750 --> 01:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
nonpublic
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
so there's another area statute says
 
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
they may elect to do this now they were
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
saying right here in this which we're
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
not changing 1B at all that it's going
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.109 --> 01:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
required only for non that's
 
01:51:14.119 --> 01:51:15.870 align:start position:0%
required only for non that's
right

01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
nonpublic only the ones that participate
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.589 --> 01:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
I I'd be very careful there because you
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
know when you start involving
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
nonpublic there's a reason why we had
 
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
the May there before regardless of where
 
01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:35.719 align:start position:0%
you know the the students which are
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
being tuition to them whether it be
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
through a tuition program or through an
 
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
sort yes
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
represent I feel the need to make this
 
01:51:50.589 --> 01:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
comment um
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that in this committee we
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
are often talking about issues where we
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
agree on the what I'm thinking mental
 
01:51:59.229 --> 01:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
health I'm thinking school lunch feeding
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
children children not going
 
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
hungry here's another one safety of
 
01:52:06.589 --> 01:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
children I care deeply about those poor
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
children who suffered during that crisis
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't mean to downplay it by not
 
01:52:14.189 --> 01:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
mentioning you know
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
um what we seem to always disagree on is
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
the how and often that how regards
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
government overreach you may call it an
 
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
attack I'll be more subtle call it
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
government overreach is what this is
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
about and the difference between these
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
two bills is that the previous one was
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
about public schools okay I don't think
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
the government can overreach in their
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
own schools but this one's about private
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
schools so that's what I take issue
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
with okay so so just
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
um and and and I appreciate your your
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
your your your com comments Arlene and
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for my earlier um um
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
Interruption so
 
01:52:59.950 --> 01:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh but but I what I what what you just
 
01:53:03.069 --> 01:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
were were suggesting uh reminded me of a
 
01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
of a bill that that was passed earlier
 
01:53:08.430 --> 01:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
um that would uh would allow a um Public
 
01:53:15.629 --> 01:53:15.639 align:start position:0%
School Board to contract with a private
 
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
school for um to to provide educational
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
program for all of its students and in
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
that case
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
obligations I I and maybe this is
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
another attorney Fenton question what
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
are the obligations that the local
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
school board the contracting school
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
board has in terms of assuring the um
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
01:53:50.189 --> 01:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
or assuring I guess assuring the safety
 
01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
of its of of their public school
 
01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
students in an environment where um
 
01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
where where the employees of that
 
01:54:00.669 --> 01:54:00.679 align:start position:0%
private school have undergone uh FBI
 
01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
criminal history checks the same way an
 
01:54:06.069 --> 01:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
employee of a of a um a direct employee
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
of a public school uh so does that does
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
that apply to the Contra to a public
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
school district that contracts with a
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
private school for Educational Services
 
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
does that private school have to comply
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
with the same
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
FBI it's it's it's it's really related
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the one we're talking about right now
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
628 which which is specific to
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
non-public schools that are providing
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
Services Under learn everywhere and efas
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
but um but if um if the argument goes
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
that non-public schools should not be
 
01:54:48.189 --> 01:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
mandated to provide to require criminal
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
history checks on employees does that
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
does that also apply to when a
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
non-public school is contracted by a
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
school district to provide all
 
01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
Educational Services um for their for
 
01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:03.589 align:start position:0%
Educational Services um for their for
their

01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
students well we have a we have a bill
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
that um yeah I mean there's there's a
 
01:55:12.589 --> 01:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
bill that says that um that a school
 
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
board can approve a non-public school
 
01:55:19.950 --> 01:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
for um under tuition uh agreement for to
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
provide services for its students so
 
01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
what does that non-public school have as
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
far as um as far as FBI criminal history
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
staff yeah yeah right and I thought a
 
01:55:44.669 --> 01:55:44.679 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago Rick that there that
 
01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
we were that e uh that Edna was doing a
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
were there was is there a study
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee hist whether it was sb8 at the
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
time or not but we we underneath the
 
01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
tuition School tuition program where the
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
local school board makes the decision
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
where the kids are going to go to they
 
01:56:09.069 --> 01:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
have to they they approve the local
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
board approves that receiving School
 
01:56:12.199 --> 01:56:13.189 align:start position:0%
board approves that receiving School
based

01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
based
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
upon certain identified requirements
 
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
that are in that language I'd have to go
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
back and but I know the health and
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
safety are are all part of that um can't
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
education the the the local school
 
01:56:32.109 --> 01:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
district is still responsible for
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
providing yeah oh yes that's sending
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
school still responsible for that but
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
the but the receiving school which may
 
01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.390 align:start position:0%
the but the receiving school which may
be

01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
a a school like fford Academy which is
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
in Vermont which is taking kids from all
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
over this side of the Connecticut River
 
01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
um they may not provide all those Serv
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
services but they meet whatever the
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
local board has set up and I I think
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
they do meet those standards because
 
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're pretty well established school
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
um but um we'd have to look at the
 
01:57:02.189 --> 01:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
statute see specifically what it say
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
right um I I think maybe that's headed
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
in a different direction than um our
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
Focus right now and we're um a little
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
bit behind uh a schedule um with our
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
next two bills so uh if there any final
 
01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
comments let me just I think I want to
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
respond to the issue of
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
overreach I think one of the concerns
 
01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
here is that as we begin to expand
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
public Monies to other
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
entities it is the responsibility of
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
this committee and of this
 
01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
legislature to ensure that those public
 
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
monies have the have the appropriate
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
oversight and this happens to be I we
 
01:57:47.470 --> 01:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
can all agree on the issue of student
 
01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
safety but I think
 
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not like You' still have
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
got these private entities out there
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
that are operating independently once
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
they begin to receive public
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
monies taxpayer
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
monies then it is the legislator's
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure that the
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate oversight is there and I
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
think that is really the I can't speak
 
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
for representative Tanner but I think
 
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
that's the intent here is that when you
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
have public monies going into these
 
01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
various programs
 
01:58:22.589 --> 01:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be some oversight
 
01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
some some entity that's looking out to
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that the uh taxpayers are in
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
fact getting that kind of oversight
 
01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's needed that's that's that's I
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
think what the intent is here thank you
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
um so given the time and we have some
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
members of the uh uh next subcommittee
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
who have been sitting uh waiting for a
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%

morning
 
02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
is coffee machine working coffee

02:04:47.760 --> 02:07:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:25.950 --> 02:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
I I think maybe we're finally ready to
 
02:07:28.990 --> 02:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh begin these this set of
 
02:07:33.069 --> 02:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
bills um apologize for the delayed start
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
um me got into a a little bit of lengthy
 
02:07:39.549 --> 02:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
conversation with the previous
 
02:07:43.149 --> 02:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
ones um but this uh
 
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
first uh bill is uh 218
 
02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
and representative Miler I think you
 
02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
just handed out an amendment no mine
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
mine is were two 61 oh 623 right yeah
 
02:08:01.069 --> 02:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's what we're doing 623
 
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
all right all right so here's where we
 
02:08:05.709 --> 02:08:05.719 align:start position:0%
are with this uh
 
02:08:10.589 --> 02:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
baby uh when we when we left the last
 
02:08:14.189 --> 02:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
session I did take this bill uh to our
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage committee and did pass
 
02:08:21.069 --> 02:08:21.079 align:start position:0%
it out seeking some of their
 
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
input uh frankly I didn't get much uh
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
but I did uh did get an opportunity to
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
work with uh Steve applebe on this when
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
we left uh this conversation last time
 
02:08:37.950 --> 02:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
there were five areas of
 
02:08:42.669 --> 02:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
concern one area was that the uh that
 
02:08:44.910 --> 02:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
this should be a state program
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
administered by the doe and not uh uh
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
obligating local school districts to
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
have to budget uh for this that was one
 
02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
area uh second was an area of whether or
 
02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
not this could be retroactive to other
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh to employees that would qualify under
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
that one to five year
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
stipulation uh the third area that we
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
talked about was should we include in
 
02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:18.639 align:start position:0%
the bill also shortage of teachers in
 
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
special education math and
 
02:09:23.709 --> 02:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
science uh the fourth area that we
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
talked about was that it should be more
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
than just University graduates from the
 
02:09:28.719 --> 02:09:30.350 align:start position:0%
than just University graduates from the
University

02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
University
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
system um and uh the fifth area was kind
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the definition of the teacher
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
shortage so what we've done in this
 
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is that we won we have uh made
 
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
this a state
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
program on the sixth area was of course
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
the cost cost of the program uh so what
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
we've done in this amendment we've made
 
02:09:56.669 --> 02:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
this uh a basically Department program
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
to be administered by the
 
02:10:01.229 --> 02:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
department uh in thinking about the
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
issue of having it retro OS said that
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
that's a very difficult kind of language
 
02:10:10.109 --> 02:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
to put in to make it retro rather that
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
it should be more prospective rather
 
02:10:13.199 --> 02:10:14.950 align:start position:0%
it should be more prospective rather
than

02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
retrospective um then we looked at the
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not should
 
02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
include uh shortages in special ed
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
teachers and administrators Math and
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
Science and I talked with applebe about
 
02:10:30.750 --> 02:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
this at length and we both came to the
 
02:10:33.709 --> 02:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
conclusion no that this should be a
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
program that basically deals with as
 
02:10:38.549 --> 02:10:38.559 align:start position:0%
it's as it's as it's intended is to deal
 
02:10:43.069 --> 02:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
with the rural and um and the
 
02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
those Pro those school districts that
 
02:10:51.229 --> 02:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
are um are underperforming schools so we
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
did not include that in here uh we also
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
then excluded the issue of only
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
university only University students and
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
that it would be any new teacher that
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
would be uh going into a school district
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh then the other area deals with the um
 
02:11:13.229 --> 02:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
the financing of this and I learned uh
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
recently that the current um fund
 
02:11:19.709 --> 02:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
balance of the education and trust fund
 
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
is $220 million that's sitting there so
 
02:11:26.589 --> 02:11:26.599 align:start position:0%
the 1 million and the2 million
 
02:11:29.310 --> 02:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
respectively that are mentioned in the
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
um bill should be able to have ample
 
02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
funding from the trust fund uh and then
 
02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
we also updated the um dates that this
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
would be uh appropriate you also will
 
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
note on uh the third page line
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
three uh there's an indicator that
 
02:11:50.910 --> 02:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
including the cost of administering by
 
02:11:53.709 --> 02:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
the department and talking with Mr
 
02:11:55.950 --> 02:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
applebe he he didn't think it was going
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
to take a lot to do this but he said
 
02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
he'd like to have at least some note
 
02:12:01.709 --> 02:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
that if he had to have an employee that
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
would work you know 20% of the time or
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
something that would be covered uh by
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
the uh by the appropriation so those
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
were the changes that we made and uh
 
02:12:15.310 --> 02:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
that's uh where this where we stand with
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
this right now Mr chair
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um comments or questions for
 
02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:32.430 --> 02:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
cascaden uh thank you
 
02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to figure out what would
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
identify a rural school and I think it's
 
02:12:43.549 --> 02:12:43.559 align:start position:0%
20 enoll students per square mile so can
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
the department kind of come up with a
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
list of schools based on that criteria
 
02:12:51.149 --> 02:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
was their criteria okay so they've got
 
02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
definitions I didn't put obviously in
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
the bill but they have def definitions
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
for um uh both Rural and those
 
02:12:59.599 --> 02:13:02.589 align:start position:0%
for um uh both Rural and those
underperforming

02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
underperforming
 
02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
schools just yeah just one more question
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
um UNH had done a a rurual um school
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
program I don't know if that's still
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
operating or was it just a 5year grant
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
project you I don't know the status of
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
that no but I am aware of that program
 
02:13:23.470 --> 02:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
yes because it was very successful if
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
the state could do something very
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
similar um which it sounds like this
 
02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
would do that does some of that yeah
 
02:13:35.470 --> 02:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
coupled with a mentor program obviously
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for
 
02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative Miler or um comments uh
 
02:13:44.910 --> 02:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
generally on the uh the proposed
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
amendment I do have one question um
 
02:13:52.270 --> 02:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
the uh appropriation of $1 million for
 
02:13:54.669 --> 02:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
25 and 2 million for
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
26 um those are uh caps to the program
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
um so that if there are you know more
 
02:14:06.990 --> 02:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
new teachers let's say um I do believe
 
02:14:09.229 --> 02:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere in here that the governor is
 
02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
authorized to draw more okay yes I see
 
02:14:15.390 --> 02:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
it um on page three and yeah I'll C the
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
million and two million is a shot that
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
right have no idea what that would be
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
y I do know that that as represent lad
 
02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:29.549 align:start position:0%
y I do know that that as represent lad
said

02:14:29.549 --> 02:14:29.559 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
earlier representative lad said earlier
 
02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
there is a a p a very similar Bill
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
pending in the senate in
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
217 um so I just I want to make sure
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
that we have uh both bills may come into
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
if if this were to pass would come into
 
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of a conference committee
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
to look at whatever the differences are
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
of the bills and um 217 is um a retained
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill in the Senate as well correct yes
 
02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:56.470 align:start position:0%
bill in the Senate as well correct yes
yeah

02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
yeah repr K Ken so this loan repayment
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
would apply to a firste teacher going
 
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
into a rural District yes okay is there
 
02:15:07.950 --> 02:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
any commitment for them to stay so many
 
02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
years within that District or does it
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
matter we we talked about that we talked
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
about you know if you go from one one
 
02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
school in the district to another school
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
in the same district we just we just
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
want to get this moving to try to have
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
some incentive for people to to be in
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
these Rural and under under service
 
02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:28.549 align:start position:0%
these Rural and under under service
schools

02:15:28.549 --> 02:15:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah uh thank you I had a a good
 
02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
telephone conversation with Brian
 
02:15:37.870 --> 02:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
sitting here with us today just last
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
night or it was yesterday afternoon
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way Brian um that
 
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
this uh we have a number of bills right
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
here coming for us we have 6 23 218 and
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
217 which is in the
 
02:15:56.189 --> 02:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
Senate 217 then um in our my discussion
 
02:15:59.069 --> 02:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
with uh Mr Hawkins was that it kind of
 
02:16:01.709 --> 02:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
Echoes legislation that was recently
 
02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
passed by the state of Idaho uh and
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
there is a very similar bill which they
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
passed they used uh much of the same
 
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
language which you're seeing here
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
including the amount of money to be
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
awarded over the first second third
 
02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
awarded over the first second third
fourth

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
years um they also addressed rule
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
isolation schools uh pursuant to what
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
they identify as rule out in Idaho of
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
course their definition going to be a
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
little bit different than what we have
 
02:16:31.310 --> 02:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
here because they really do have some
 
02:16:34.110 --> 02:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
rule rural areas out there uh but they
 
02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
also have monies going towards economic
 
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
disadvantage school-based on
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
eligibilities that receive uh Title One
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
monies so that would bring in in our
 
02:16:44.399 --> 02:16:45.389 align:start position:0%
monies so that would bring in in our
case

02:16:45.389 --> 02:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester and those schools which are
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
economically um hurting so it's it's not
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's just not just rule it's rule in
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
underserved uh Educators and and
 
02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
districts which are are hampered by the
 
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
the the economic situation within those
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
communities and federal dollars which
 
02:17:08.429 --> 02:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
they receive so I would really uh
 
02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
because the whole concept what I see
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
what Idaho did is very positive and
 
02:17:16.349 --> 02:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
that's reflected in 217 and to a degree
 
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
in 218 as well it's
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
all this language is kind of coming
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
together so um i' i' I'd encourage us to
 
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
you know I had a good conversation with
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
Brian on that he also forwarded to me
 
02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
the information that came from Idaho
 
02:17:31.709 --> 02:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
with their
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh how how it's working
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
um seems to be a real good program so I
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
think maybe there's room here for
 
02:17:43.309 --> 02:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
merging these things into something that
 
02:17:45.389 --> 02:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
we have and we discuss this again
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at 1:00 with the teacher
 
02:17:49.469 --> 02:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
shortage committee and we're just
 
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
finishing that up but uh I know that
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
this will be a point of discussion there
 
02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.389 align:start position:0%
this will be a point of discussion there
as

02:17:55.389 --> 02:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
well representative cascaden thank you I
 
02:17:59.910 --> 02:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this addresses it on
 
02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
line four it does have Part B this on
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
page two economic disadvantage of the
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
school based on eligibility for funds
 
02:18:10.589 --> 02:18:10.599 align:start position:0%
pursuant to Title One Part A of the
 
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
elementary and and secondary Education
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
Act I don't know if that's what you were
 
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
talking about but that would be included
 
02:18:19.309 --> 02:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
here from what I I
 
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
understand represent Damon thank you on
 
02:18:26.190 --> 02:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
the same topic um charlot actually spoke
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
to what I was thinking about that
 
02:18:28.399 --> 02:18:30.349 align:start position:0%
to what I was thinking about that
Manchester

02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
02:18:32.589 --> 02:18:32.599 align:start position:0%
Claremont um probably some other
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
communities wouldn't qualify as rural
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
based on the definition in first page
 
02:18:38.359 --> 02:18:40.190 align:start position:0%
based on the definition in first page
line

02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
2324 so I keep wondering if this
 
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be rural or underperforming
 
02:18:50.190 --> 02:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
school education program or and or so in
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
other words you'd be eligible if you
 
02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
taught in either the rural District the
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
underperforming or
 
02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
both you know um I look at Claremont and
 
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
Newport as desperately needing this to
 
02:19:05.389 --> 02:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
help with retention but I don't think
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
they qualify as rural repres I agree
 
02:19:13.629 --> 02:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
with the the rural part of that and the
 
02:19:17.469 --> 02:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
or and but I when we say or underperform
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
pering School
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
District um I like the language that
 
02:19:26.589 --> 02:19:26.599 align:start position:0%
Idol has even more and it reads
 
02:19:29.429 --> 02:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
specifically economic disadvantage of
 
02:19:31.549 --> 02:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
the school based on eligibility for
 
02:19:33.549 --> 02:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
funds pursuant to Title One Part a
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
federal Elementary and secretary
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
Education Act as
 
02:19:41.709 --> 02:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
amended um so it's the economic money
 
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
flowing to it and that's that economic
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
base it's not necessarily
 
02:19:48.509 --> 02:19:48.519 align:start position:0%
underperforming which might you know
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
well you're not performing well with the
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
achievement scores and I don't think we
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
should be basing on that I think it's
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
should be based on this other Target
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
which uh Idaho put in place I I think
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
maybe that language from Idaho is what
 
02:20:06.190 --> 02:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
you were referring to representative
 
02:20:08.349 --> 02:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
Damon in terms of economic disadvantage
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
on Roman
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
2B um so I think if anything um Roman 6
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
where it says role and
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
underperforming School educator it
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
really should refer to Roman 2 which has
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
two

02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.389 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
sure okay may I yes go ahead I if I may
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
my my concern is is um I don't know
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to 2117 in the
 
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
Senate all right and so I think by
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
having two concurrent Two Bills moving
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
in a concurrent
 
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
fashion um I have let me I have Greater
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
Hope for the house because I don't know
 
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the Senate
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
so it's always a crap shoot over in the
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
S it is and I so my sense is if if if
 
02:21:25.150 --> 02:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
something were to possibly happen in the
 
02:21:26.429 --> 02:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
Senate obviously it's going to come over
 
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
to here again it's we're going to see it
 
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
here but I just think
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
um we've not been able to get much uh as
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
a result of the uh teacher shortage
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee through uh before the the
 
02:21:44.830 --> 02:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
house uh and so that was why I was even
 
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
though I knew that 217 was moving
 
02:21:48.270 --> 02:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
through it I just thought we should have
 
02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
another one over here too as a
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
compliment right they complement one
 
02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
another yeah and I just off from if
 
02:21:58.590 --> 02:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
there any Senators um tuning in on my
 
02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
apologies for that prior comment about a
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
crapshoot um represent cordelli yes um I
 
02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
would I would suggest that
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
we have a side by side made here between
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
217 and 263 of course we have two
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.830 --> 02:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
um is is is uh doesn't really specify
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
all the things that 218
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
does um or 217 because 217 and 218 are
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
are verbage is very very
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.389 --> 02:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
263 are are these three bills all for
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
the the same intent the same purpose
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
yeah because when when I look at 217 and
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
218 and
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
Idaho the numbers are the same Romans 7
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
is on on on
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
2623 those are the same numbers that
 
02:23:21.269 --> 02:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
appear in the others uh one500 2500 3
 
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
3500 4500 the $1 million $2 million same
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
thing uh as we see in all these bills so
 
02:23:30.910 --> 02:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
I I think there's there's a possibility
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
here we could be able to use one of
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
these bills as coming from the house and
 
02:23:42.349 --> 02:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
parallel it with
 
02:23:44.670 --> 02:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
27 and I think we have a better chance
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
of getting something happened
 
02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
I I I would suggest that we have general
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
for four work on a side by side for us y
 
02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
we can make that request could I ask one
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
question um resident Miler on your
 
02:24:01.269 --> 02:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
amendment to make sure I have my
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
understanding correct in terms of the um
 
02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
the award so that if a teacher an
 
02:24:12.030 --> 02:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
educator goes into one of the um uh um
 
02:24:15.469 --> 02:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
schools that we're defining here um they
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
could and they stay for four years years
 
02:24:22.110 --> 02:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
um they could get uh a total of uh I
 
02:24:25.630 --> 02:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
think $112,000 that's correct
 
02:24:29.349 --> 02:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay and if if they leave beforehand
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
they would just get whatever they've
 
02:24:34.630 --> 02:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
been uh based on the number of years
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you I mean I I think
 
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
I think frankly the intent here
 
02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
is it's kind of a
 
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
um a um an incentive that hopefully if
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
they're there for three or four years
 
02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
they'll want to stay I mean that's
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
really that's what the intent is here as
 
02:24:58.469 --> 02:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
well as to help them out too sure
 
02:24:58.479 --> 02:24:59.510 align:start position:0%
well as to help them out too sure
represent

02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you I just wanted to add a
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
perspective um last night I was at a
 
02:25:07.230 --> 02:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
Goan school board meeting Goan tuitions
 
02:25:10.990 --> 02:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
all their students to other schools um
 
02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
kada2 and the main meeting was Newport
 
02:25:18.429 --> 02:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
School District which uh receives their
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
students they had nine people presenting
 
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
the various different programs in the
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
Newport school district and in the
 
02:25:27.670 --> 02:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
discussion it came out that the entry
 
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
level salary in Newport for a bachelor's
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
level teacher is
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
$37,000 in
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
change you know it just I mean we know
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
how different the payment the salaries
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
are in different
 
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
districts but you can go 15 minutes down
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
the road to sunap and get5 to $220,000
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
more so the need for this to
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
address these economically poor
 
02:25:57.269 --> 02:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
districts is
 
02:25:59.790 --> 02:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
profound I I would just come in I think
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
that we see that in many professions um
 
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
you know nursing uh I know for instance
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
with County nursing homes versus
 
02:26:12.309 --> 02:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals Etc so um representative L
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
yeah in uh my conversation the other
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
evening too um there there are some
 
02:26:18.190 --> 02:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
different is you know two of the bills
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
have four years one has five years but I
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking right at the titles right
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
now and I I think that we got to be very
 
02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
careful uh of the the impact we may get
 
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
from some people within our community
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
when we talk about forgiveness you might
 
02:26:39.070 --> 02:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
have those saying well I just went to
 
02:26:41.870 --> 02:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
school and got a two-year skill uh
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
training in an associates degree I'm not
 
02:26:46.269 --> 02:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
going to get any forgiveness on that
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
skill I paid my way whereas I look at
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
the other two bills one says as a title
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh establishing an early educated
 
02:26:57.710 --> 02:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
professional development Grant taking
 
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
that word forgiveness out the other one
 
02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
217 establishing a rule in underserved
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
Area Educator incentive program for
 
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
higher education and making
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation thereof therefore I think
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's I I I just inclined to think
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
that when we talking about forgiveness
 
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
what's are we going to be doing next for
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
what other training and skills areas uh
 
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
whereas we're recognizing there is a
 
02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
shortage and C certain areas we have
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
problems in underserved area economic
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
service areas like Manchester with that
 
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
shortage of Science and Math and special
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
education Etc um I I think that the
 
02:27:39.269 --> 02:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
whole thing is not necessarily the
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
primary purpose for this is to get
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
qualified people into the classroom to
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
teach and to keep people there rather
 
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
than than jumping ship and going and
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
working for Exxon Mobile or some other
 
02:27:54.429 --> 02:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
outfit uh and but so I'd rather not call
 
02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
this a pro forgiveness program I'd
 
02:27:57.920 --> 02:27:58.790 align:start position:0%
this a pro forgiveness program I'd
rather

02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
rather
 
02:28:01.630 --> 02:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
address something more specific like 218
 
02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:02.389 align:start position:0%
address something more specific like 218
or

02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
217 right I I believe representative
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
miler in your Amendment you did change
 
02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:07.550 align:start position:0%
miler in your Amendment you did change
the

02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
title well it says incentive program you
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
I was looking at the original yeah the
 
02:28:17.269 --> 02:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
original title which know it it says
 
02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
early educated professional development
 
02:28:24.269 --> 02:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
on summer on 218 uh 623
 
02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
says in it does say loan forgiveness
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
program it said loan forgiveness
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
program on on the initial right right
 
02:28:36.349 --> 02:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's got to change right in 322
 
02:28:36.359 --> 02:28:37.790 align:start position:0%
that's got to change right in 322
Amendment

02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:28:41.070 --> 02:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
2322 it looks like uh the title is
 
02:28:43.469 --> 02:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
replaced with establishing the rural and
 
02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
underperforming school educator
 
02:28:46.750 --> 02:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
incentive program and making an
 
02:28:50.590 --> 02:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation therefore that's echoing
 
02:28:53.790 --> 02:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
217 which I think is
 
02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate yeah yeah
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative mcon thank you
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
um I posed a similar question at our
 
02:29:04.269 --> 02:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
last meeting on this bill but it still
 
02:29:06.269 --> 02:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
pertains to the amendment specifically
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
page three beginning on line five which
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
is again the governor being authorized
 
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
to draw a warrant for the additional sum
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
out of any money in the treasur
 
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
is that a typical practice to not have
 
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
checked by the executive counsil
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
especially as wring to not have a limit
 
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
on that says any money could that just
 
02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
be unlimited and is that a mistake or
 
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
should that be addressed within this
 
02:29:35.630 --> 02:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
bill to put a cap there perhaps process
 
02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
right the process for that is that any
 
02:29:39.389 --> 02:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
money it's it's going to have to go
 
02:29:39.399 --> 02:29:40.469 align:start position:0%
money it's it's going to have to go
through

02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:29:44.190 --> 02:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal so there is a legislative step uh
 
02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
which oversees this process so that's a
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
committee a joint committee of the
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house and then it's
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
everything that goes before the governor
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
and counsil goes through fiscal so I I
 
02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
think and this is typically the way
 
02:30:01.469 --> 02:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
things are written when we're at the
 
02:30:04.269 --> 02:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
second year or a year in which we have
 
02:30:06.269 --> 02:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
already approved the budget so we're
 
02:30:08.469 --> 02:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
looking where can we go to find these
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
monies uh whether through a Federal
 
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
grant a state money might have something
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
doe or are we going to go back and dip
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
into the a trust fund of kind and I
 
02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
believe that um is in the education
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund similar language so that if
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
there is not a surplus and there is
 
02:30:26.349 --> 02:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
money needed the governor can just uh
 
02:30:29.469 --> 02:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
draw a warrant for the needed funds
 
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah good question yeah further
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
questions on this bill or you know we'll
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
we'll see about a a side by side and um
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
well I I'll work uh I'm trying to maybe
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
have another amendment that that makes
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
it even closer okay great thank you when
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
you talk about side by side you mean
 
02:30:53.950 --> 02:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
218 yeah I I really think that's where
 
02:30:59.269 --> 02:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
we need to go to to Really spread it out
 
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we need to incorporate this
 
02:31:04.110 --> 02:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
compared to what the Senate has if we
 
02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
can get on the same page pretty much or
 
02:31:09.070 --> 02:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
we can get them on our page I think we
 
02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
have a better chance having this move
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
forward and we do know that uh the those
 
02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
two bills have been mimicked off of
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
other states specifically
 
02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
idah and and that's that's important to
 
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
help carry something through where
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
they're seeing success in the program
 
02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:28.030 align:start position:0%
they're seeing success in the program
out

02:31:28.030 --> 02:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
there and I can speak to where I was on
 
02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
the northwest when I was a Ministry up
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
in the Northwest we had a similar
 
02:31:37.990 --> 02:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
program it works it works helps keep
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
people so um I think it's a good effort
 
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:45.160 align:start position:0%
um the side by side 218 217 I do that
 
02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
side by side and try to match those and
 
02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
I put the time and effort there Mel
 
02:31:53.269 --> 02:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
rather than putting it in a 623 you're a
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
anyways but put 623 on it oh yeah put
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
623 there too but it's going to have to
 
02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
come together yeah yeah great yes a
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
question for representative Myer about
 
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment were the grant or partial
 
02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
years factored in if a teacher stay only
 
02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
part of a year and then had to leave
 
02:32:21.389 --> 02:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
would they get half of the amount for a
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
giving year or is that just not factored
 
02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
in good question I don't have an answer
 
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
question my my my presumption is is that
 
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
the the grant would not be awarded until
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of the end of the to have
 
02:32:40.349 --> 02:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
completed the cont complete
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
contract so they're always in a year in
 
02:32:47.469 --> 02:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
re okay thank you
 
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
um any further comments on 623 um and I
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
think we've at the same time talked
 
02:32:55.389 --> 02:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
218 uh pretty much in terms of where we
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to uh um look at a
 
02:33:05.230 --> 02:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
comparison between the three bills um uh
 
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
heading into I I don't think we need a a
 
02:33:12.030 --> 02:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
further meeting until November um I
 
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
think we can uh deal deal with it at
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
that point if that's okay yeah can I say
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
one more thing sure 623 is very specific
 
02:33:24.670 --> 02:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
to it talks about the university system
 
02:33:26.910 --> 02:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
no not anymore okay so we're we're
 
02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
taking that all aside good it's all gone
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's great straight break
 
02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so starting to shape up like the
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
other two bills yeah yeah yeah yeah good
 
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:44.840 align:start position:0%

02:33:47.429 --> 02:33:47.439 align:start position:0%

02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
