good morning it's a little after 10:
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
a.m. sorry for the delay here I'm going
 
00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and open the subcommittee
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
from the special Family Court committee
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
on title 4 and do we want to start with
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
justice for
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
you so I believe part of why we wanted
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
to to start this subcommittee was to
 
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.629 align:start position:0%
to to start this subcommittee was to
find

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
out how much money was coming in from
 
00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
title 4 and then where it was going and
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative Smith actually found a
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive LBA report
 
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.909 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive LBA report
which

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
shows the exact kind of amount in the of
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
the awards into the different areas so I
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see if if anybody had
 
00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:03.879 align:start position:0%
anything that they wanted to add in
 
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
terms of things that they wanted to
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
discuss regarding
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
this yes representative
 
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
long yeah from what I we call the
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
testimony is
 
00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
um that a lot of the child support
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
initiatives are to fund these
 
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I mean TANF I wouldn't think that
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
that' be one but some of these promoting
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
safe and stable families you know I'm
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a tie in
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
from employees working on these programs
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
that there there's a lot of testimony uh
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
with they're looking for child support
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
because they get they get compensated
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
through the feds and they want want to
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
know uh like there's an incentive to
 
00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
have John
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
support um so can you
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
sorry so I did repl get some of that
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
information from attorney crean with the
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
court who was able to provide and I was
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
just trying to look and see how it maps
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
in where
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
come up come up even closer we don't B I
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
promise sit at one of these chairs here
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then we can all hear each other
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
because with any luck at all you have
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
information that could be helpful to us
 
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
that's why we
 
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:51.430 align:start position:0%
that's why we
G

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah why don't we just I don't know
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
if if everybody knows who everybody is
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
if we want to just introduce each other
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
real quick I'm representative cab
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
smithan thank you very
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
much what's the difference between the
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
two of you so he's doing tanif and she's
 
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
so she's doing title A tanif and she's
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
doing title 4 d which is child support
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
you okay so
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
um attorney KGAN provided to us that in
 
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959 align:start position:0%
under title
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
4D they get 1 million in
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
funding and their overall court system
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
budget is roughly 130 million so it's a
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
small it's less than 1% of their
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
operating budget and I was trying to see
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
if we can see here who was they you
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
should they get the court
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
court so I'm guessing that's what this
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
1.2 million is maybe we're rounding here
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
that well D is two lines
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
here um
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
is do you know like if the child 15 and
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
a half and then 1.2 well total yeah do
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
you know if the if the
 
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
14.3 billion is what goes to DHHS for
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
child support enforcement is that
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
approximately do you know approximately
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
if that's your operating budget for that
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
and she's um she's
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
party her yes okay and then she attorney
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
krian also mentioned that they also got
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
an additional 50k a year for the office
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
of mediation and arbitration which comes
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
from title 40 which is part of the axis
 
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
and visitation so that makes it like
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
1.05 so I'm sure that there's probably a
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
couple other programs that we just
 
00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:30.150 align:start position:0%
couple other programs that we just
didn't

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
do you mind turning your mic on thank
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
you so much just so everybody that's
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
watching could hear you have to pull it
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
closer uh if you look on the the back of
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
the the page it talks about what the uh
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
incentives are so it has to do with the
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
five key performance
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
areas and then depending on how you do
 
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
on those you get those incentive funds
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
which then have to be reinvested in the
 
00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:01.110 align:start position:0%
which then have to be reinvested in the
program

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
so the performance areas of fraternity
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
support order establishment current
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
collections AAR Collections and cost
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and how does New Hampshire
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
do on
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
those it I don't have the information in
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
front of me we always do very well in
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
we I we I don't think we're up to
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
getting 100% but we're somewhere between
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
70 and
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
100% but again I can I can get you that
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
information so I guess so do you know
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what kind of how the breakdown
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
of the incentive is I guess for for
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
establishing a support order and can you
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
explain what that means is that is that
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
in the is that in the sense of when the
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
court establishes the order or is that
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
in the sense of this person's in a rears
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
and we're finding that person and
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
establishing how the funds are going to
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
come through wage G establishment is
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
actually establishing an order Okay so
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
get when when they talk about patern
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
let's go through paternity establishment
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
obviously establishing paternity of of a
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
child who comes into one of our cases
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
that does not have a second parent on
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
the birth
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
certificate support order establishment
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
is establishing a support order for a
 
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
case and that can be the first temporary
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
order could be the final
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
Uso during the life during the life of a
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
case Uh current collection so
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
collections towards the the ter of art
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
is uh MSO which is the monthly support
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
obligation the current monthly support
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
obligation so that's what they they talk
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
about current
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
Collections and then aage collections
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
would be arear that had been owed prior
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
to the month that they're currently in
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
and then cost Effectiveness is a very
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
complicated math problem with regards to
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
how much is spent and then per how how
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
many dollars come in for child support
 
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
C could you tell
 
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.389 align:start position:0%
C could you tell
me

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
um what falls to the
 
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
department and what falls to the court
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of responsibility here is the
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
court making these determinations or is
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
the department making the determinations
 
00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
the department making the determinations
determinations

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
determinations
 
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.230 align:start position:0%
determinations
well

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
establishing paternity establish modify
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
and enforce support obligations obtain
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
child and medical support for
 
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
know do you make those determinations
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
and report them to the court for what is
 
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
your role and what is the Court's role I
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
guess is is would be my question does
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
that make sense yes yes it doesn't you
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
know just tell me it
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't um we are a a federally 66%
 
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
federally funded program so the federal
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
government has
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
said in order to get these funds you
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
need to do these various things which
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
includes all the stuff that's on here
 
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
and part of that that's allowed on in
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
the statutes and in the uh the Federal
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
Regulations is the use of um Cooperative
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
agreements with courts law enforcement I
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
think there's a couple others as well so
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
we have a Cooperative agreement or a
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding with the
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
court that describes our relationship
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
with regards to
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
what we do and what they do so then they
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
provide us with what we call expedited
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
process and then we pay them for the
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
time that they spend on cases so let me
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
ask you this is title 4D only is the
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
intention of that to recover
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
money for Tan families is that the
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
intent on that or is it for families
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
even it's both it started out originally
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
as tan of recovery but only less than
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
10% of our cases are tan of cases now t
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
t of cases are falling across the across
 
00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.069 align:start position:0%
t of cases are falling across the across
the

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
country and both cases both kinds of
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
cases get treated exactly the same so
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
we just bring them forward and then we
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
get an order we try to uh and then we
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
enforce it we also can take applications
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
from people who didn't who have a child
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
support order
 
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
already um and then they can bring it to
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement so if I may that so so child
 
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.789 align:start position:0%
enforcement so if I may that so so child
support

00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
incentives is just for your
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
division yes okay and theou you have
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
with the uh Family
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
Court does that payment come out of
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
this out of the incentives no comes out
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
of the regular the regular your your
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
regular buget as far as I know yes so is
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
there a line
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
item uh is there a line item that kind
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
of matches quasi matches what you paid
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
last year and what will be paid this
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
year now we're now we're getting into
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
areas that I don't know anything about
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
and that's your we can make people from
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
our finance division available to you to
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
ask to answer those type of questions
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
66% um 66 66% of your division is
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
correct through this alone Char sport
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
incentives no not the incentives the
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
incentives are separate oh so okay six
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
just the reg the regular budget and so
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
we have the regular budget and then we
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
extra so let me ask you this are the
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
only people that are involved in this
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
program people who didn't pay their
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
child support orders to begin with I'm
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand what what
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
establishes that the
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
person would go through title go through
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
your office rather than just paying the
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
other parent directly
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
what what is the you know the the
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
precursor to your office getting
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
involved is it well if we estab if we
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
helped to establish paternity then we're
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to stay involved in the case
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
indefinitely because we were involved
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
after that point or is it only if the
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
the party isn't
 
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.750 align:start position:0%
the party isn't
paying

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
we've the first
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
major differentiation between cases are
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
tan and on tan if you are on tanif
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
you've assigned your right to child
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
support to the state so you're required
 
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.350 align:start position:0%
support to the state so you're required
to

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
cooperate so if there is a child if
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
there already is a child support order
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
we would just take it over and enforce
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
it if there isn't a child support order
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
which also includes if there isn't
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
paternity we would bring a case forward
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
establish paternity establish a child
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
support order and enforce
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
it when
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
the residential parent the the terms are
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
all over the place with regards to what
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
you call people but if the oblige or the
 
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.230 align:start position:0%
you call people but if the oblige or the
paye

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
paye
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
then no longer wants our services they
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
can just say no longer want your
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
services we close our case and then they
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
can go forward and you know they have an
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
agreement how however however they they
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
get paid but the vast majority of our
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
cases are just an application from
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants their services which
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
most of the time is to paye in that they
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
want child support if they don't have an
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
order or they want their child support
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
enforced um if if they already have an
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
order we do get we do do take
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
applications from payors who want their
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
payments to go through us so that so
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
that there's a record so that they don't
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
have to worry
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
about proving they made
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
payments um we also help people with uh
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
modifications of child support the child
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
support order so those are the S those
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
are the sort of the broad broad brush s
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
to speak of how that works if I could
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
can you make those decisions
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
within the department or do you have to
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
get the court to agree we get a court
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
order because that's what our job is to
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
enforce the court orders so if the
 
00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.510 align:start position:0%
enforce the court orders so if the
parties

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
agree we can write up the agreement it's
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
called a uniform support order is the
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
requirement of of all child support
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
orders need to be on a uniform support
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
order so it makees sure we check all the
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
boxes so if the parties agree we get
 
00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.710 align:start position:0%
boxes so if the parties agree we get
them

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
together do do all the relev paperwork
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of paperwork um and
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
then we can submit that to the court and
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
the court in most instances will sign
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
off on it then what's the fee for that I
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
guess the fee um if the only time we
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
charge a fee is if you've never been on
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
tanip then the paye is charged $35 a
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
year but if you've ever been on public
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
assistance there is no fee at
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
schedule um schedule is not the right
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
word how long does it take from when
 
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
you prepare in order until the court
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
signs off on
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
it that's entirely impossible to predict
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
so much of it depends on the parties it
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
depends on which court we're dealing
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
with some courts are much more busy than
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
others um our stuff is generally handled
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly because we do have
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
expedited service from the
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
court um a lot of the times the biggest
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
issue is locating one or both of the
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
parties because we can't do anything
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
without we're looking for Dad we got to
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
be able to find Dad and we got to be
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
able to serve dad because we can't do
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
things in court without parties being
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
served so sometimes that can take a long
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
time and you say Dad um or mom well I
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
understand that but I mean do you say
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
Dad because it's more
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
likely to be
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
Dad where there might be
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
some delay
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
in locating him and not necessarily I
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
mean the
 
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
um it just it just depends on how easy
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
it is to locate them do they have an
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
actual uh a regular address are they
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
living where they've always lived or are
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
they couch surfing because the party's
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
just broke up and Dad
 
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't gotten an apartment yet so then
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's like where where is he how do we
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
serve him sometimes we can serve people
 
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
at at their jobs if they have a regular
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
address of their jobs things like that
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of people do the tanif or I'm
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
sorry do the application for services
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
because the the biggest tool that we
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
have in our toolbox is wage
 
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.590 align:start position:0%
have in our toolbox is wage
assignment

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
assignment
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
so if you have a child support order we
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
get a wage assignment then then money
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
comes in the the rule is is that if when
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
an employer writes the employee a check
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to write write child
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
support a check so it should be coming
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
in it goes through our sdu which is our
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh secure our state dispersement unit
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
which brings the money in and then
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
writes a check right back out it's got
 
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
to be out within 48 hours it's usually
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
out within 24
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
hours that's important to note right and
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
then we keep all the records so
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
that years down the road they
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
um you verify right you can verify and
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go look for every
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
canceled check or argue that oh I gave
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
you cash or that type of thing and there
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
have been studies that talk about how uh
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
if if you take the money piece off the
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
table if Mom doesn't have to ask Dad for
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
a check or vice versa every time they
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
exchange the children or they give it to
 
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
the the child and the child you know
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
drops it in a puddle or whatever if the
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
if the money piece is sort of going
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
automatically that that it helps the
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
tensions between the parties sort of
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
relax because it's just one thing they
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to think
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
about now is the 66% funding that's
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
given is that given by a contract
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
between the the federal governing
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
program I guess and DHHS or how does
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
that work how does that 66% funding come
 
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.389 align:start position:0%
that work how does that 66% funding come
into

00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
play that's a good question I mean we
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
are considered a for a a 4D agency it's
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's a function that the state of New
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is required to have and in the
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
like federally required fed required
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
right and in the broadest possible terms
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
because again this is all I this is the
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
way I think of it in my head because I
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
don't need to know anything more past
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
that um it's my understanding that we
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
take our
 
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.669 align:start position:0%
take our
budget

00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
monthly uh in some form and they and
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
send it to the feds and the FEDS send us
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
back 66% of that so basically this is
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
what we spent this month and then they
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
send us 66% back so we so we're required
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
essentially to engage with
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
the with the the federal program for for
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
child support enforcement that's like
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay in terms of um your interaction
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
with the state judicial
 
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.789 align:start position:0%
with the state judicial
branch

00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
charge what would you do to make that
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
interaction better or is it just working
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
fine I would well we everybody always
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
wants more
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
people and I know that that the court is
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
working on that their budget has been
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
increased and that they're hiring people
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
and type things one of the things that
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
the court has um
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
that and and use in this process are
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
hearings officers so they're not judges
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
they deal with child support issues
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
only and I think they need a couple
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
more so we have we sort of have a mix of
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
where we get our orders in some some
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
Court we get them from the hearings
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
officers the hearings officers make
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations and the judges sign off
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
in some courts we we appear in front of
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
the judges so when you mean the differen
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
is in county by county at court by Court
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
yes court by Court okay there's 32
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
Family Division courts right now we we
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
have hearings in 30 of them because we
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
don't have hearing the uh C Brook
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
hearings are heard in Lancaster and
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
Candia hearings have been moved to Derek
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
is there a state plan I've heard
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
something referred to as a state plan
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
regarding child the child support
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
services and whatnot is is there a state
 
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
plan is and do you know where I can get
 
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519 align:start position:0%
a copy of that oh I can get you a copy
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
so a state plan is part of the um the
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
federal statutes and regulations and it
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
it basically sort of lays out all the
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
pieces these are all the things you have
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
some of which um there are choices like
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
you can if if you want to do this you
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
can do it this way you can do it this
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
way just tell us which way you're doing
 
00:29:03.549 --> 00:29:03.559 align:start position:0%
it okay so so when you say that we're
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
required I guess
 
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
to to do these things my my question is
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
is are we required in order to get the
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
funding or are we required just in
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
general that you have to you have to
 
00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.950 align:start position:0%
general that you have to you have to
have

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay I have a list of some of the
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
helpful so with with respect to um the
 
00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:44.919 align:start position:0%
court orders uh what percentage of those
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
would be wage
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
garnishments I don't have the number off
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but I would say more
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
than 70% More than
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
70% and do some people ask for that if I
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
if I'm a pay
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
and I'm voluntarily want to go through
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
you to keep the record straight can I
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
ask for that yes okay when do you know
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
when judges preside over these cases are
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
they reimbursed for each case that they
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
preside over no okay well it's
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
complicated there's theou and I'll have
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
I can get you a copy of the of theou the
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
judges judges time is not charged to the
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
expedited ser to the expedited uh
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
services that we get okay hearings
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
officers are and then there's a the
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
judge doesn't do peace work the judge
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
has a salary correct and I mean they
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
they they do but they've done they've
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
done time studies that that that show
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
what percentage of time do you spend on
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
4D information so the hearings officers
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily judges and they're
 
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
not paid as judges cor okay so are the
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
hearings officers attorneys or do you
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
does so I guess is there an incentive to
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
do are you paid separately for each one
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
of these five things in the sense of
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
like for each case if you establish you
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
know paternity um establish a support
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
order and then
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
you have you you have the person current
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
on Collections and all that are you
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursed that 66% for each of these
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
steps or is it just if we do these
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
things overall then we are reimbursed
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
for 66% of our overall operating budget
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
we only work on 40 40 cases so we get
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
66% of all of our expenses that have to
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
do with every case the incentives deal
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
with the entire case load it's not
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
individual cases it's percentage of
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
cases so paternity establishment we over
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
90% of our cases that needed paternity
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
establishment have paternity
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
establishment and is that what the
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
require is that what the the requirement
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
is more than 90% each one is is set
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
differently and I don't I don't have
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
that the state plan yes okay Y and then
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
the same thing with how many of your
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
cases have orders established how many
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
of your cases have a payment this
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
month towards current support how many
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
cases have payments towards rear and
 
00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
then cost Effectiveness is a whole
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
different set of math okay um and then
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask a question that some I
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
guess it got asked of the Court as well
 
00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:00.519 align:start position:0%
are the employees that are handling
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
this or these cases are they paid on
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
like a salary basis or are there any
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
incentives for them like bonuses or
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
whatnot for more of these types of C we
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
are state employees we get paid just
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
like every other state employee I
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
thought so but I wanted to just sorry to
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
ask the question but I wanted to get it
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
on the record that that's not how that
 
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:23.720 align:start position:0%
works I and I understand that the turn
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
incentive can be a little
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
confusing so with respect to uh Child
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
Support Enforcement are the feds
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
qualifying that well yes because because
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
they they're dealing with
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
the collections of current support and
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
then collections of the aers so that's
 
00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
that's the enforcement side okay but
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
like the goal is to achieve positive
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
outcome for children by addressing the
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
needs and responsibility of the parents
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
right do they do they look at what
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
you've done or or do you just
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
put that category down in
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
$80,000 and they'll give you 66% no they
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
look they definitely we are audited
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
yearly so they verify oh yes oh yes most
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
Uso the
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
Uso's I think seven pages long now five
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
of which get filled out two of which are
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
instructions um most of the requirements
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
that are on that are things that the FED
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
that that the feds have required over
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
over time with regards to what's
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to be on there notices to the
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
parties about things that happen um
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
medical supports a big thing takes up
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
like a page at one point years ago and
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
I've been with the department for 24
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
years so feels like a million some days
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
um at one point they were moving medical
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
support into they were that was going to
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
be another one of these incentive
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
categories but um it's been bogged down
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh with the feds so are there any
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
federal employees that are part of bccs
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
or is it all New Hampshire state
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
employees it's all New Hampshire state
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
employees and we have contracts with
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
various vendors that perform certain
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
things but if you're talking about
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement of Child
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
Support it's state employees we are
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
we're based in we have 11 district
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
offices one in each County and two in
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
two in Hillsboro one in Manchester one
 
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.150 align:start position:0%
two in Hillsboro one in Manchester one
in

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
ASA and that's where the cases are are
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
based out of the district offices
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
because they're they're the ones who
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
start the cases on the enforcement end
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
or the establishment end and then
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who live with the cases
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
on the enforce enforcement end and is
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
not a federally assigned employee
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
overseeing aspects of this through
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
aspects of the state's incentives no
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay so there no I mean we have we have
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
a a federal office out of Boston that
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
that uh overseeing is is a is too strong
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
a word that you know they they offer
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
support mostly a lot of technical type
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
type things um my understanding that the
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
ones we have right now they're they're
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
having issues with Staffing as well but
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
they don't uh they're not even attorneys
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
so and they covered New England and
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
Boston yes region one is uh New England
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
all right so is bcss is it a federally
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
contracted program or is it just that
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
it's federally required but it's not
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
contracted I'm just right it's not
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
contracted not contracted okay have you
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
has there ever been a t I hope if you
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to answer any of these
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions of course you don't have to
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
and if we are really you know digging
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
down there and you want to say enough we
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
understand don't please you
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
know has there ever been a time when the
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
state has
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
not passed
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
muster in the
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
feds that's that's a hard question to
 
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.790 align:start position:0%
feds that's that's a hard question to
answer

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
um there are different different levels
 
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
of passing and it depends on on which
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
review there's a lot of
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
reviews and they do a data
 
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
reliability review which is
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
their that's yearly um because obviously
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
they they they check our system to make
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
sure that the system which is
 
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.910 align:start position:0%
sure that the system which is
Nexus

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
Nexus
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
um shows the same information that's
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
actually in the file because the data
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
which we deal with that's all in in the
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
database needs to be accurate
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
so that's that's their sort of biggest
 
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
thing we also deal with the IRS we've
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
got uh they review us I believe it's
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
every three
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
years you you mentioned that the there's
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
a bcss federal office that's in Boston
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
so let's say that somebody in New
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a complaint can they
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
complain to the New Hampshire Federal
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
office like is that I mean the sry
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
Boston federal office okay and then how
 
00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
does that work like then they they would
 
00:38:27.319 --> 00:38:27.990 align:start position:0%
does that work like then they they would
get

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
most likely get in touch with our
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
director and they'd figure figure it out
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
from there and that's the closest
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
Enforcement office well we enforcement
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
is done throughout all our I meant
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
federally federally yes yeah okay yes
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
they they don't turn it over to you to
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
enforce they enforce it themselves so if
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
I called and complained about something
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
they would give me a resolve they
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say turn it over to you and
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
tell me call whever it really depends on
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
the case I mean they're gonna they're
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
gonna have to check in with us because
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
they don't know anything about the case
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
right and they wouldn't have any access
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
to it right how it then gets handled
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's really going to depend on what the
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
what the but are there times when they
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
would I would be in stay in contact with
 
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
the regional office yes I mean they okay
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
but sometimes they'll just the regional
 
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
office will just turn it over to you yes
 
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
and is it is it to you or to the
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
director as a specific person who would
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
they reach out it would be the director
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
first who's and who is the director
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
latowski okay
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then she would bring in whichever uh
 
00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
you know she'd make a team of of who she
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
would think appropriate based on what
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
the the nature of the complaint is
 
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.109 align:start position:0%
the the nature of the complaint is
okay

00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
yes I have a really basic question and I
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
apologize um but I want to go all the
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
way back to the beginning just to make
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
sure I really have a clear understanding
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
and anybody who's watching has a clear
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
understanding too um so it's my
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
understanding from what you're saying is
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
that only those who receive the can if
 
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
are required to participate in a wage
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
garnishment program the well they're
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
required to to participate in the child
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
support program okay the wage assignment
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
is a piece of that but it's not all of
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
it and if they did not receive that do
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
the person who's the obligator whoever's
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
paying um do they acknowledge or sign
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
anything anywhere to know that this is a
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
voluntary um that they are not required
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
to participate that they can make
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
personal payments and do they
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that through putting their
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
signature on a piece of paper saying
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
that they're voluntarily um enrolling in
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
this there's an application process it's
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
all application driven if we don't have
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
an application we can't enforce that
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
order okay and both have to apply no
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
just one so if one applies and then so
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
if the one person who's receiving the
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
money applies and the other person who's
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
paying the money says I don't want to do
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
that then what happens then the case is
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
still open with us and we enforce it and
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
technically they can they can go to
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
court to to ask them to ask the court to
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
have us not be the enforcer of the case
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
but if the if the order says that it's
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
payable through us it's payable through
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
us they would have to get the order
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
changed to have it be payable to
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
directly to the oblig so they'd have to
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
go so just again for clarification so
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
one parent puts in an application that
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
they want to get paid directly that way
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
and not through a personal check um and
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
then what's the next step does it go
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
back to the courts or does the person
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
who's paying now have to pay for an
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
attorney to go back to court to say I
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
just want to pay on my own I don't want
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know I'm perfectly capable of paying
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
my own I don't want to participate I I'm
 
00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
not understanding how does it then get
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
decided that one person gets to say what
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
they want to do and the other person has
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
no inut that's what the this this the
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
statute says as long as the let's let's
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
take an example every application is
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
approved was what you're saying well the
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
application is they're always approved I
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
mean assuming they've given us the
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
information that we need there is no
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
there is no qualification like tan up
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
where you have to have a certain type
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
thing so I guess that's where I'm it's
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary but it's voluntary on I
 
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
understand because you've got the two
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
the two people okay so that's what I'm
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
getting at so it's really not voluntary
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
it's one person saying what they want
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the other one has to go along with
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
it without any saying process there are
 
00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances under which it doesn't
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
have to be it it can't it
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
so what is the process if the other
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
person doesn't want to
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
participate um in having let's take an
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
example non tanip yeah no Take that off
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
they get divorced right they get
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
divorced they have a uniform support
 
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.710 align:start position:0%
divorced they have a uniform support
order

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
okay on the second page it's there's a
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
check off box for payable to it's either
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
to the oblig or bcss and then it says
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
other if it's payable to bcss which is
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
what we usually advise the courts to
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
do and the oblige applies for services
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
we will take the ca we we take the
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
case forward because it's payable
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
through us and we have an application
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
and then is that only the $35 a year or
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
do you take a percentage of those funds
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
$35 a year so you guys don't get any
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
percentage of the nope
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay so we so we're still going back to
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
what I said the other person are they
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
being made aware that they can they
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
challenge it or can they set up a
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
different account to deposit directly
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
into the child's that gets done during
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
the child support hearing or the divorce
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
hearing or
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
whoever okay and is someone there to
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
guide um the other one to let them know
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
what their options are that I'm not in
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
the room so I I I it depends
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
on what kind of hearing or meeting
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
they're having where the Uso gets put
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
together okay uh the court has case
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
managers the court has mediation the
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
court has court hearings so and at any
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
one of those points a Uso can be issued
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
if the parties agree okay so if the
 
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
parties agree that that that dad's GNA
 
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
pay mom and is gonna do a um direct
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
deposit or if they've never had any
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
concerns with regards to yes he's going
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
to pay me you know we get a long fine we
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
just don't want to be married anymore
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
you can do that
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
and then it's payable to the oore we
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
never payable to the oig we never see
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
the case they go on their merry way but
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
then what what'll happen is that if when
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
if if Dad stops
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
paying mom can come to us and say I need
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
help in forcing it and there are there's
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
part of the statute that that talks
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
about what the rules are um mostly she
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
would need to come in and say he's 30
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
days behind on child support if he's 30
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
days behind on child support we file
 
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
something with this called and notice to
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
make payable
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
which basically says Dear oore since
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
you're 30 days behind we're taking over
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement and they don't like that
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
they can ask the court for year right I
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
understand that and I I appreciate that
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
part of it that when that happens I
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
guess from the people who came in who to
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
testified before us I think the question
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
was that they or the concern was that
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
they weren't aware that they even had an
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
option of saying I prefer not to do that
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
and I prefer to um pay directly um and I
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
think that was where there was kind of a
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
contention there um and I think I guess
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get out is how
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
do we make sure before they sign a paper
 
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
that they know that they have that there
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
are specific options for them if they
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't have an attorney there to explain
 
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
it to them I mean there are instructions
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
on the on the uniform support order that
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
there's a check off box where you can
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
say the parties agree to make this
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
payable you know between themselves to
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
have no wage assignment because
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
then they explain it so it's the option
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
is right there on the form again I'm
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
been in a full divorce hearing since I
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
was in private practice so okay I guess
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to come from the other aspect
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
when I hear somebody say well the
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
options are on the form and the people
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
can read it unfortunately we know that
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
so many people are not reading um or
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
would even understand this and so I
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
think that's where I get concerned
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
because I think that things have to be
 
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
verbally explained to people they have
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
to accept understand acknowledge that
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
they actually understand it and I think
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
that when people are in these really
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
contentious or even just this very high
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
anxiety kind of a time they're going to
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
sign things without really understanding
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
what they're signing then they come in
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
and they testify and say I didn't even
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
know and then you get that thrown back
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
well you should have read it and it's
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
like but we know that half our society
 
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
is not reading at proficient levels um
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
so I I guess that's where I'm coming
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
from is to making sure that before
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
people sign it that everything is
 
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
explained that they know their options
 
00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.829 align:start position:0%
explained that they know their options
um

00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
and and we make sure that we're not
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
coming back to the table because they're
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't understand what they were
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
I'm unclear as to how much information
 
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
the Court gives people I know that
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
they're required to watch some videos at
 
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
a first appearance when they first start
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
this whether they deal with that or not
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
and then again with the case managers
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
and with the
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
mediators about how much they actually
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
explain right okay that might be an area
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
done for the part we to look in that
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
more information is always better than
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
less information you mentioned that the
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
application is is done by Statute and I
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
was pulling that up that's 458a is that
 
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
what that's
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
under and if so I'm I'm my question
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
regarding that is is that is it required
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
by federal law or or the federal program
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
that we have these statutes in place in
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
order to be able to receive that 66%
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
funding or just in general is it
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
required that we
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
have sort of both they there are are
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
definitely requirements which is part of
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
the state plan of you shall have these
 
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
things and who writes the state
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
plan the the requirements of the state
 
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
plan are set out in federal statute and
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
regulations the requirements are fedal
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
each state shall have a state plan and
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
each state plan shall
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
have these many things some of which
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
are you shall have a wage assignment
 
00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
statute you shall have a driver's
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
license replication uh system that type
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
of thing a lot of it has to do with the
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
the Nexus in the computer system as well
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
and so who actually does that work is
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
there is it a is it multiple people or
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
is it the director that mostly takes
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
care of that well putting together the
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
state plan yeah well the state plan is
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
is sort of housed in our policy
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
department and they're they're the ones
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
who sort of keep it together as a as
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
a document and then anytime we make a
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
change to the document including our the
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
new guidelines worksheet we're going to
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
have to change the state plan um anytime
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
we change it we have to give it to the
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
feds and the feds have to approve it
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
does that go to jail car at all
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
no it's so it the approval process
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
involves the feds but not
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
State corre okay thank you yes we do
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
have a couple we do have a couple of
 
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
internal of um regulations that and
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
rules that we go through through ja
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
power but not those not the state
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
plan if you look at it's the the federal
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
statute that deals with with all of this
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
is 42 USC 651 through 669 can you say
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
that one more time sorry 42
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
USC 651 through
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
669 thank you and one of those
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with the state plan
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
does the does the administrative office
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the Court have have weigh in with the
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
state plan as well or is it just d H HS
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's just the HHS okay and are there
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
requirements in the state plan for the
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
court I would I'm just curious because I
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
guess I would see now that you're
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
mentioning the the
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
worksheet it would be then a requirement
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the court to use that worksheet right
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
right well the worksheet is required by
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
okay by federal statute or state statute
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
so to go back to your previous question
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
458 a that's that's the uniform child
 
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
custody jurisdiction and enforcement
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
action that doesn't Adit yeah no sorry I
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
think I gave the wrong one we start 458b
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
which is the income assignment 458 C
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
which is child support
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines so B and C yeah and then we
 
00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:54.799 align:start position:0%
skip to
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
461a 14
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
which is where all the child
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.599 --> 00:51:06.109 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
okay and then if you want to have a lot
 
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.990 align:start position:0%
okay and then if you want to have a lot
of

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
fun you can read
 
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
youa which is four or sorry
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
546b that's the uniform Interstate
 
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
Family Support
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
act which deals with cases between
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
states and between countries okay um and
 
00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
I know that we have a quadrennial child
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
support report that comes out which is
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
believe does that report and I I've read
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
through much of it but it's a huge
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
report I know that it had suggested you
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
know changes to the way that we do some
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know the child support calculations
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
which we made a few changes on that this
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
year and we'll see what happens the next
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
time but are there other changes in
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
there that are relative to rec
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations for updating of the
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
state plan and the ways that we do
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
things that are not legislative or is
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
that mostly just suggestions
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
on the legislative piece of it I guess
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
it's most it has to do with the
 
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines so if it's not sort of
 
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:14.910 align:start position:0%
guidelines so if it's not sort of
guidelines

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
specific it it that's that's all it went
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
to because that's the only thing that's
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
guidelines and do you know if we've ever
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
um CH you know
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations we've done some
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
um it's been difficult I
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
mean we've
 
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
had we don't take a position with
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
regards to what the guidelines should be
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
we do the review we present the
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
review to the people in this building
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
and then it's up to them to to decide if
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
they think our if our guidelines are
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
fair and appropriate or whatever the
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
language is in the in the in the statute
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
to to keep
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
going as long as they're 4D compliant
 
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
going as long as they're 4D compliant
meaning

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
that it meets all the the the
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
requirements for from the 4D
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
program and those requirements are the
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
ones that are in the US the 4D T USC 651
 
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:34.589 align:start position:0%
ones that are in the US the 4D T USC 651
through

00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
669 um and then somebody mentioned some
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
sort of like a Cooperative agency
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
agreement with the
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
DMV we have a cont we have anou with
 
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
with with the with the DMV for our
 
00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:53.309 align:start position:0%
with with the with the DMV for our
license

00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
verification now I'm curious on a piece
 
00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
of that have has there do to your
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
knowledge has there ever been any
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
challenge with I guess the
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to travel and the
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
the license being hold to your knowledge
 
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.390 align:start position:0%
the license being hold to your knowledge
has

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I can look I mean I'm sure it's
 
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
been challenged has it been challenged
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
successfully I don't believe so and
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's a federal requirement right it is
 
00:54:21.549 --> 00:54:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
b11 and nothing about the logic of
 
00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
who might need that license in order to
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
job who would no longer be able to get
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
to the job to earn the money that's
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
support I guess what I would say is we
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take the license of somebody
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
job so generally generally the the issue
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
is they come in well how am I supposed
 
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
to get a job if I don't have a driver's
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
license and the thing is is you've got a
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
driver's license now and you're not
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
making their payments if somebody has a
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
job and they're making they're making
 
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
their payments there's no reason we
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
would take their take their D's license
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
thank you that's except for we we are
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
allowed we don't we haven't I don't
 
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
think we've ever actually done it at
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
least in my my tenure um if somebody's
 
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
refusing to cooperate with paternity
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
testing technically we can take their
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
license well but we usually don't we
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
usually don't do that we usually just
 
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
take them to court and have the judge
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
yell at them and then then they'll show
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
that so that's the department is
 
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
actually authorized to revoke the
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
license and it doesn't necessarily have
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
to go through court so you don't there's
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
not really due process on that I guess
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
the due process is built into the
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
statute they have notice we don't it's
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh suddenly get pulled over because they
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a license they get a they get
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
they get a notice there's time type
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
built into the built into the uh into
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
the statute and then a lot of times it's
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
a way to get somebody's attention
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
they're not paying they're not
 
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
contacting us they're not letting us
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
know what let us know what's happening
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
and then we we say if you don't do this
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to take your license then
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
they get a hold of us and go well I
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
broke my leg six weeks ago and it's like
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
dude you didn't tell us you know we need
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
to we need to know what's happening
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
especially in cases we can help them get
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
a modification if they're not working
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
and have a good reason not to be working
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
we can help them get a modification of
 
00:56:37.039 --> 00:56:38.109 align:start position:0%
we can help them get a modification of
their

00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
order but we can't do that if they don't
 
00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
us I believe we have yes and it's not uh
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
license but if they're working and
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
making their payments we wouldn't take
 
00:56:57.029 --> 00:56:57.039 align:start position:0%
it like you can can have a CDL but if
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
you're not using
 
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
it and we we also do come in with
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
negotiations so if somebody came to us
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
and said look I can get this job but I
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
need my license we will contact the
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
employer to to confirm that that's
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
what's happening and we will give the
 
00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:21.510 align:start position:0%
what's happening and we will give the
license

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
back they right they don't I don't if if
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
they verif I don't know what it how
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what what they would what that
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
like we are also U it's not just
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses we can do professional
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh licenses we get a a very good turnout
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
for um hunting
 
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:45.559 align:start position:0%
licenses some people don't care about
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
their driver's license but Bo they care
 
00:57:50.109 --> 00:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
about what's
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
their agreement with fishing game for
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
that yes what's the reinstatement
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
process that I'm not um I might be
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
skipping over it but so let's say you've
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
revoked somebody's driver's license how
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
do they get it back let's say hey they
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
they now have this great job offer but
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to drive to work
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
how how would they go about getting we
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
we send a notice to DMB asking them to
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
revoke the revocation or resend the
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
revocation so is there is that is there
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
like um jail car rules on that because
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just not seeing no I don't believe
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
there are it's it's just you guys just
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
how or is it just there we go if you
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
B1 Roman Neal
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
six when an obligor after certification
 
00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:51.039 align:start position:0%
subse subsequently complies with the
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
legal order of support the department
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
shall provide the obligor with a written
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
release indicating the obligor is comp
 
00:58:58.589 --> 00:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
with the legal order of support but but
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be in compliance at
 
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
this point because they need the job in
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
order to get back the the aers that they
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
owe but that means they're I mean we're
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
gonna we're g to put it together for
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
them so that they're going to get a good
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
job with especially a wage assignable
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
job I mean that's that's the point is to
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
get them is to get them working we don't
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
take their license because well do you
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
think that that piece of the statute
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
should be updated because it says when
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
they subsequently comply with the order
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
the department shall give them a written
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
release but what about before they
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
comply but they're making a good faith
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
attempt to comply by getting that job
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
like is there any is there any is there
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
we would want something from the
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:13.549 align:start position:0%
 
it's

01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
right not no because I mean in theory
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
there there could be
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate jobs that don't have wage
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
assignment a available but that's going
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
to be a harder
 
01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:32.390 align:start position:0%
to be a harder
row

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
too right and a lot of times the other
 
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
thing they'll do is they'll be like all
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
right you know you need you have a job
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
you need to show me that you can that
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
you're making your payments so even if
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
you don't have a a you know a real job
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
they're doing Uber and door Dash and all
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
those other things but if they start
 
01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:50.839 align:start position:0%
making their payments they'll they'll
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement with them of of
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
what they think's going to work and it's
 
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
like okay if you show me you know three
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
weeks in a row you're you're making your
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
payments then we'll have a discussion
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
now do you think that that should
 
01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
potentially be updated though because it
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't really
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
require that the license be given back
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
until they have complied with the order
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
I guess it's just that's a little bit
 
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
concerning to me because especially I I
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying about well for
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
sure if the job has wage garnishment
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
then we're going to do that
 
01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:23.039 align:start position:0%
but if the job doesn't because maybe
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
they're getting a job at a small
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
landscaping business that just doesn't
 
01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:27.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enough employees where wage
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
garnish because I think that's the
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
requirement for wage garnishment right
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
like there has to in order for wage
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
garnishment to be applicable it has to
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
be a certain number of employees or
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
something how does that work if it's a
 
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a W2 job the employers are
 
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.430 align:start position:0%
if it's a W2 job the employers are
required

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
to go with it okay so it's when it's if
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're getting a contract position like
 
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.470 align:start position:0%
you're getting a contract position like
w49

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
w49
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
10 there's legal debate over that as
 
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
well given given the definition of
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
income but right now we we don't ask for
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
wage assignment against 1099 wages okay
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
so I mean I guess do you think that like
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.839 --> 01:02:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
person

01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
is you know
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
is is trying to become imp if the person
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
needs their driver's license in order
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
to go to the job which they have a job
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
offer for because we'd want to make sure
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
we said that they actually had the job
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
offer not not just that they need the
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
license in order for employment because
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
then like you're saying sometimes they
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
don't try and actually get a job but
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
let's say that they do have a job offer
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
from for employment that there's a
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
path for them to be able to get the
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
license back because I'm only seeing in
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
the statute it's saying that they shall
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
provide it when they comply with the
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
order could because could anybody just
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
decide hey I'm not I'm I'm just not
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
going to give you your license back
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
because I just don't really believe
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
it we usually put together an agreement
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
is that's just with the relationship
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
between the case worker and the and the
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
oore and there's no rules on that it's
 
01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
just how that person right every every
 
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
case is different and there's no role or
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
let me reward that is do you see a role
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
for either the legislature or jail car
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
in that process I don't know anything
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
about jail car um are you
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
lucky that's what I've heard
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
um so how that how that would get
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
involved I that I don't but but
 
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
involved I that I don't but but
you

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
your work relationships with the
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
relative departments fishing game DMV
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
whatever and with um the two
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
parties um whichever terms you want to
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
use for them the pay the pay or the you
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
know o or
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
whatever those
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
proceed in a as smooth and timely a way
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
as they
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
can without you seeing the need for
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
legislative intervention is that
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
true I mean I'm not saying that
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislative intervention is
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
never needed but I guess I just don't
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
know what it would look like in this in
 
01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:56.950 align:start position:0%
know what it would look like in this in
this

01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.789 align:start position:0%
this
circumstance

01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
um just because there are so many
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
different scenario scenarios about how
 
01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:18.950 align:start position:0%
different scenario scenarios about how
this

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
happens can you turn on your mic sorry
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
yeah if if we would if we would change I
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
think a case where work with with an
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
individual has a better Rapport than if
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
we statutorily
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
said if somebody comes to you uh with a
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
job offer and they need a
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
license um then you may you must uh I I
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like it because what I
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony is
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
that as soon as they get a hold of the
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
person that's in a rage and talk about
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
their license I'm looking at a 90% of
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
the time or that somebody uh would get
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
back to you if you're looking to take my
 
01:06:04.829 --> 01:06:04.839 align:start position:0%
license I'm I'm giving you a call and
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
I'm cutting a deal that I those type of
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
numbers I don't have have in front of me
 
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
but it is it is one of our most useful
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
tools right okay so I mean I guess
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
though but is there a way to appeal it
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
what if you have
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
a what if you have a a case worker who
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
just they don't like this person and
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
they don't want
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
an internal um administrative appeal
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
unit you do yes in
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
DHHS okay um and then I know you said
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
that there's like the $35 a year fee but
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
I'm curious of the weight of the money
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's I guess garnished from the wages
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
or whatever that's that's taken that for
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
somebody that's not on tanip how much of
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
that actually goes to the oblige all it
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
except except for the $35 so they get
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
100% of it so you you you take in $1,000
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
you give the other parent $1,000 okay
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
the only time that would be different is
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
if there are tan aers because somebody
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
can be on tanip and then be come off
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
tanip and there might still be a reers
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
owed to
 
01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
tanif um the fed the all the money the
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
rule is all the money goes to the
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
oblige first and then to tan except for
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
federal tax
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
refunds that we take from
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
I IRS those are required by federal
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
statute to be paid towards Tanana perers
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
first if there're No Tan of perers then
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
they would go to so the an employee an
 
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
employer um they get compensated for uh
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
doing that added work for um I I think
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
they're allowed
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:04.710 align:start position:0%
 
it's

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
458b 458
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
B6 in addition to the amount withheld
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
for support in a reage the employer May
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
deduct a fee of $1 for each withholding
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
$1 that's they can I don't think they
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to and I'm okay and where does that
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
dollar come from it doesn't come from
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
the it would come out correct correct it
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
would come from the
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
avore okay so they would take $300 from
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
his check send us a check for
 
01:08:39.309 --> 01:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
$299 okay and keep $1 do you know if
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
there's somewhere we could find out like
 
01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.349 align:start position:0%
there's somewhere we could find out like
how

01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
many cases that there are per year and I
 
01:08:46.769 --> 01:08:46.779 align:start position:0%
guess what case type that they
 
01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:48.590 align:start position:0%
guess what case type that they
[Music]

01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
are I mean we have we have those
 
01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:52.759 align:start position:0%
breakdown breakdown of numbers our case
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
load right now is about 28,000 oh you do
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
course so you're just looking for Tan up
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
versus non- tanip or anything else just
 
01:09:12.269 --> 01:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
title four cases in general like how
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
many there are and you know the
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
breakdown of I guess kind of what they
 
01:09:16.159 --> 01:09:19.110 align:start position:0%
breakdown of I guess kind of what they
are

01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
okay it's always it's always more
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
Enforcement cases than establishment
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
cases because obviously establishment
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
cases turn into enfor
 
01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
and then Enforcement cases live as long
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
as the cases are open which can be years
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
and years and years is there also a way
 
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
to track um
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
Interstate cases where the party has
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes we have a an entire
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
separate Interstate
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
unit that deals with where the C the
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
court case is being done in a different
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
state so they're charge so basically
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
whoever had applied for services usually
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
the oblige is here in New Hampshire but
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for some reason doesn't
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over the obligor so
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
then we send the case to the appropriate
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
State and ask the state there to
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
establish if we don't already have an
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
order and then to
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
enforce and it is that a process that
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
generally Works smoothly do you need
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
individual um mlus with other states or
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
is it just standard the UA the
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
458b uniform Interstate Family Support
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
Act is a required piece of legislation
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's required the the feds required
 
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
all 50 states to pass it exactly the
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
same okay thank you you had to ask for
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
permission to change a
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
word so in theory it should go it's to
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
me it's still amazing after all this
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
time that each state still does stuff
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
different um based on how their state
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
set up um I mean I could complain about
 
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
Florida forever but that's a whole other
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
thing does this does the state plan
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
contain all the details on all Theus
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
that you guys have
 
01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
question it may or it may not but I can
 
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
get you all of the all of the use that
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
we that we yeah that would be great just
 
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
so we have all the we have all the
 
01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
information that would be if that's an
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
easy thing for you to get so I have to
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
go back I want I want to go back to ask
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
the chair a
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
question are
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
we this has been incredibly helpful I
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
can't thank you enough for your being
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
willing to be here and to answer all
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
these questions and I think those of us
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
um really appreciate
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
it but I want to go back one step
 
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.229 align:start position:0%
it but I want to go back one step
because

01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding which might be
 
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
completely off base is that what brought
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
us to this isn't how
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS handles this but how the court
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
handles it and are there problems that
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
the family court the problems with how
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
the family
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.629 --> 01:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
far what I've taken from this morning's
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
discussion is that the
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility rests very
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
solidly in the
 
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
department and that the family
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
court is just uh just puts it in
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
premature on
 
01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
what the department has worked out and
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
it would appear that they are doing that
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
in as timely a manner
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
as is
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable is is that an accurate
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
assessment I would I would agree with
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
that I mean we we use the Federal the
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
Family Division
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
system because obviously there are the
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
Family Division has cases that don't
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with DHHS right um
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
we we're given block scheduling um
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
expedited expedited service so we can
 
01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
generally get in a little faster maybe
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
um but they don't do anything to our
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
cases that they wouldn't do with anybody
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
else the forms are the same standards
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
are the same um it's just that we're
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
we're bringing it
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
I think we'd have to go back and talk I
 
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
want to have a little talk with chairman
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
Pearson about this because I think part
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
of it was this came over from the
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
other committee as well where they had
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
been discussing it through the
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
that what do you call that committee the
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
um special Department of Child the the
 
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
the one that the DHHS that Eric go L on
 
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.310 align:start position:0%
the one that the DHHS that Eric go L on
is

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
chering oh that's the D the dcyf one I
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
think part of that came I think part of
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
that was yeah because it came up as like
 
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
it came up in there but it wasn't really
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily appropriate in that so it
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
right so it came back over to here
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
although I think Ito either yeah because
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's more of like a DHHS so I
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
but I want to it would be nice if you
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
don't if it's easy to send the data just
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
so we have the data can give them the
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
data and then I want to see what we if
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
anything should be done with it because
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
I do agree that it does seem what where
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations they're not really
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
falling on the court part of it they're
 
01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.430 align:start position:0%
falling on the court part of it they're
more

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
on the administrative part of it and and
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
as we discussed I'm not sure how much we
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
want to legis legislative mandate things
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
ver letting the case workers work
 
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
through them but I do
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
think it would be nice if there were
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
some I
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
mean I I hear where you're trying to go
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and and I'm quite
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
sympathetic but it seems to me what we
 
01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.350 align:start position:0%
sympathetic but it seems to me what we
could

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
say was that this conversation has been
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
very helpful very informative we've
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
gotten a good deal of of data and the
 
01:15:59.790 --> 01:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
bottom line is this um while no system
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
is perfect and there always is room for
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
improvement none of this has anything to
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
 
court

01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
unless unless the division's enforcement
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
they have to go to like if they pull my
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
license I may I may file with the court
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
to can I don't see that you can do that
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
under the stat
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
stue yeah it's an administrative process
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
I mean people do try to get the court to
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
get them back but the court explains
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
part of me wonders if there should be a
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
way through the court to be able to
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
appeal that but I mean I again I don't
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
know that that's actually and I I guess
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
I think in some of the things we've
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
heard people have felt that the court
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
should have given it back but I don't
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
see that
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
they are legisl that that's
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
legislatively permissible for them to do
 
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
that it seems like it does go through
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
the depart
 
01:16:58.270 --> 01:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
so maybe they got blame you know kind of
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say blame but blame for
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
lack of a better word for something that
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
they had no control over they don't they
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
don't have the power to do that and I
 
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
wonder if should they have the power to
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
do that I don't know but I don't see
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
things that they actually have the power
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
to do right now that's under the family
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
court that seem problematic it's more
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
things that are not within their perview
 
01:17:20.189 --> 01:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
I guess is the better way for me to say
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
it and this has been extremely helpful
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
and I really do appreciate you coming
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't I I don't know if um Brian
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
if you had anything that you wanted to
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
add because I I really appreciate you
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
coming as
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
well uh no thank you okay I thank you so
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
much for all of this information it's
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
been great it's been really extremely
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
helpful did anybody else have any other
 
01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.390 align:start position:0%
helpful did anybody else have any other
questions

01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
for do you have an email address do you
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
want me to send all that to is there a
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
general special committee or should I
 
01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
send it to if you could send it to me I
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
can forward it out to the to the
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
committee so the whole committee has it
 
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
yeah if I if I could just uh one one
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
other question on
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
tanif uh it's it's the higher it's the
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
higher number and we're hearing that
 
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
tanif has been going
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
right well I mean year to date it's 28
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
million 28 and a half million oh I meant
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
of the cases were 10% is that what
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
number how was that number figured in
 
01:18:36.719 --> 01:18:37.590 align:start position:0%
number how was that number figured in
the

01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
66% it is
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
there the the 66% is that broken down
 
01:18:46.669 --> 01:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
into the uh ABD
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
and no it's not no all right so it's
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
just here is 66% in the state of the
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
child support program right
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
and but costs for the child support
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
program are subid
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
6% okay so TANF is um
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's right uh what is that 34%
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
so so you add 34% and that's the actual
 
01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
so so you add 34% and that's the actual
TANF

01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
TANF
 
01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.270 align:start position:0%
TANF
appropriation

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
right to the
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
child their own no
 
01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.270 align:start position:0%
child their own no
right

01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay just one more clarification for me
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
um the revoking of licenses is the thing
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
that really makes my ears perk up and so
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to other than the driver's
 
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
license you mentioned professional or
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
fishing game is taking the professional
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
or fishing game I know you said the
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
driver's license is the federal says
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
that you can do that moving over and
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
taking per professional licenses or fish
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
and gain licenses is that required under
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
federal or is that something we're just
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
doing as a state as a means having
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
something in our toolbox in addition to
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
taking a driver's license I will have to
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
double check on that for you but I'm
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it's just licenses doesn't
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
specify okay I and the reason I'm asking
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
that is because I do I get concerned
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
with the fishing game one because there
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
are people who hunt purely to get food
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
and um so when we have so much food
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
insecurity I'm like well wait a minute
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
now we're we're interfering with their
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
ability to get the food to put in their
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
feet um their freezer um so that's in it
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
it just I don't know something just
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
didn't sit right with me but I'd like to
 
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
know if that's required by the federal
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
government or if that's something we're
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
just doing as a state thank
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
you guess oh well my understanding is
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
that these numbers are low uh can we can
 
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
we get numbers of those that actually
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
had license pulled or those that
 
01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.030 align:start position:0%
had license pulled or those that
actually

01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
had uh you know their fishing game
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
license their hunting license or
 
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.629 --> 01:21:13.639 align:start position:0%
okay database with regards to yes they
 
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
the license but which license okay so it
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
seems like I want to make sure I
 
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:19.719 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly it seems like
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
the areas where the court actually is
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
involved with title four is merely to
 
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
establish the support order through the
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
worksheet um and then do they do the
 
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
court order for establishing
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
paternity yes it's all I mean it's all
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
one piece you you you come in you ask
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
for paternity and child
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
support in general we'll do the
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
maternity piece first hopefully
 
01:21:46.159 --> 01:21:47.189 align:start position:0%
maternity piece first hopefully
everybody

01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
cooperates then we move on to j court
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
and that's through the court
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
though well it depends I mean if we have
 
01:21:57.149 --> 01:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
a child for daughter and dad has a job
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
at you know Boeing we put in a wage
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
assignment we get money from thing yay
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
everybody's good some I mean a lot of
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
cases you never go back you don't have
 
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
to you know money's coming in money's
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
going out you review it every three
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
years um for
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
appropriateness and everything's off I
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
mean to bring it back to court that
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
something we would have to ask for or
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
the parties can ask as well it's their
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
case so um so the court is only involved
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
with the establishment of support order
 
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes paternity establishment and
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
then if they want to go back for the was
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
it every three or four every four years
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
modification every three years or
 
01:22:39.149 --> 01:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
anytime either of the parties um have a
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
substantial change in
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
circumstance and is the modification
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
every three years one of the parties has
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
to ask for that right so those are
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
really the only times that the court
 
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
itself is getting involved with DHHS
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
right except for well for the title cor
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
show what now what's that so at the end
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
of the enforcement process we try to we
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
use a lot of
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
different administrative processes
 
01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:07.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license credit bureau leans
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
against Real Property that type of thing
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
um but if somebody's not paying we can
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
take them to court for what called show
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
cause which is basically them having to
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
court those are handled by our child
 
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.229 align:start position:0%
court those are handled by our child
offic

01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
offic
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
so the so the the show cause hearings
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
don't go to court they do go to court
 
01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:36.550 align:start position:0%
don't go to court they do go to court
theyed

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
okay so if I had my license pulled and
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
I'm still not paying that would be a
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
show that that you would motion to court
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
I'd have to explain right why
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right so just really those
 
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
three areas that the court is involved
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
with and besides that it's mostly just
 
01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.149 align:start position:0%
with and besides that it's mostly just
done

01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
through DHHS itself without Court
 
01:23:57.679 --> 01:24:01.950 align:start position:0%
through DHHS itself without Court
involvement

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
ad this is not the other piece that's
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
not handled by
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
the uh Family Division that actually the
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
Superior Court we do have a criminal non
 
01:24:12.159 --> 01:24:13.030 align:start position:0%
Superior Court we do have a criminal non
support

01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
unit because the failure to pay child
 
01:24:17.229 --> 01:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
support is when it gets to a certain
 
01:24:19.149 --> 01:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
level it's also a
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
crime and that's and that can you say
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
the name the name of that again criminal
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
non support criminal nons support
 
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
right and that's through Superior Court
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
right so what we do in those cases is we
 
01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
put together a packet we send it to the
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate County
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
attorney and if they want to bring the
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
case forward we help them prep the case
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
we testify and then we through our
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
statute we have the ability to act
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
as pration parole officers if somebody
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
is convicted but doesn't get jail but we
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
how often does that situation occur very
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
rarely very rarely I me you really have
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
to the issue is in child boort is always
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
ability to pay and that I mean that's at
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
the The Establishment level the
 
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement level and then when you get
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
to per and then you have to prove it
 
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
beyond the reason and is very rare does
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
that mean
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
like one to five cases a year less than
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
10 like less definitely less than 10 um
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
some of that has to do with we don't
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
have the resources to bring to bring the
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
case forward um but it's also it's it's
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
something we want to do really it's not
 
01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
we're not if we have a case where we
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
know the out has a drug problem and you
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
know doesn't really have a place to live
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
and hasn't had a real job that they've
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
kept for more than a month in four years
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
we're not going to put them in
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
j u the point you know we're trying to
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
get we're trying to collect the child
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
support and having somebody
 
01:25:57.629 --> 01:25:57.639 align:start position:0%
like that then all they do is they come
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
out of jail and now they're
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
Fel and less likely and less but there
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
are people and we have gotten um you
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
know people who
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
are not going to pay they have the
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
not and those can be pretty satisfying
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
so if the parties don't agree for
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
establishing paternity that's when you
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
would go into court for the
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
establishment corre and then the court
 
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
could order that they have to do right
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
then they have to show
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
up and then we R do the
 
01:26:34.239 --> 01:26:35.990 align:start position:0%
up and then we R do the
testing

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
and tell everybody once the testing's
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
done assuming that they are dead then we
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
ask the court to schedule Med on the
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
issue of child support and when we do a
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
child support order we will check off
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
the Box on the Uso
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
that makes him the dad so that they'll
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
all right so I guess like as a committee
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
I would just thank you so much it's been
 
01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
hugely helpful I guess as a committee I
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
would say that I just kind of summarized
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
that you know the majority of all
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
administration of title for is through
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
DHHS in the only areas that the court
 
01:27:13.149 --> 01:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
administers Are Family Court by
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
establishing the uniform support order
 
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
and paternity establishment if the party
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
refuses testing the modification every 3
 
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
years if a party requests it or sooner
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
if a party request it because of a
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
significant change and then show cause
 
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
hearings and then criminal non support
 
01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.709 align:start position:0%
hearings and then criminal non support
support

01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
orders um are through Superior Court and
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's very rare you know less than 10
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
cases a year so those are really the
 
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
only pieces So within those pieces does
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
anybody here feel that there's a need
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations through those Family
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
so enforcement isn't one of those uh the
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
involved well other other than what she
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
had mentioned uh because I believe some
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the enforcement is what you had
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned but I I just wanted to make
 
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
sure that there's no other enforcement
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
that the court would be involved other
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
than what she already
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.709 --> 01:28:25.719 align:start position:0%
okay does anybody on the commit feel
 
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
that regarding the family court piece of
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
it that we should consider
 
01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the Family Court only
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
pieces that we've discussed do you think
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
that there should changes that should be
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
considered on any of these Family Court
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
pieces or do you guys feel like this any
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
of the changes that you're thinking
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
might necessarily be more DHHS base
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
changes and they're not they're outside
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the purview of the family
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
court I don't see any I don't see
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
any my conclusions and they're only my
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
conclusions they're not the conclusions
 
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
committee after the year or more that
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
we've spent on this is that there are
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
problems with the family court and to me
 
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:20.990 align:start position:0%
problems with the family court and to me
the

01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
problems come down again and again
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
to the lack
 
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.070 align:start position:0%
to the lack
of

01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.149 align:start position:0%
of
essential

01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
essential
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
Staffing support to the judges
 
01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.709 align:start position:0%
Staffing support to the judges
clerks

01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
um other organizational and
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
administrative difficulties that make
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
it almost impossible for the judges to
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
carry out the resp responsibilities that
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
we expect them to carry out and that is
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
where I see the problems rather
 
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
than um in other
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
areas and with respect to uh male
 
01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
areas and with respect to uh male
female

01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
female
 
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.550 align:start position:0%
female
punishment

01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
see I mean with the new guidelines that
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
became effective uh July
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
first September they the new guidelines
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
become effective January 1st January 1st
 
01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.669 align:start position:0%
become effective January 1st January 1st
of

01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
25 okay um yeah I I think those guidel I
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
think the new guidelines will help that
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
matter it's just a matter
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
of I'm just trying to think of the um
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
you know the complaints testimony that
 
01:30:49.149 --> 01:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
we get
 
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
um and the new guidelines I think will
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
suppress some of that testimony that I
 
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
see I don't see what else we can do with
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
that all did you have me I would like to
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
reserve my opinion on that because um
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of great information
 
01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
today but we've also requested um some
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
information and I think until I have an
 
01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to really look at that and
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
digest it um I'd like to reserve uh my
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable okay I was just looking back
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
on like the original I guess kind of
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
charge of us as a subcommittee which was
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
to research title four of the Social
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
Security Act specific to the state of
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire how much is collected hi
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
how why and where does it go and I think
 
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.070 align:start position:0%
how why and where does it go and I think
we

01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
have with this information like
 
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
the a rough outline of of that
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
information and then we'll
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
get further information out of this
 
01:32:12.189 --> 01:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
state plan so I think
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
we've done the research that was
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
suggested out of this and let's let's
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
take the time to I guess go through see
 
01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.270 align:start position:0%
take the time to I guess go through see
if

01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
anybody finds anything in that that they
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
want to bring up and
 
01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
I know that chairman Pearson was
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
meeting of the overall
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I I think he suggested we
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
do that on October 22nd so he was
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
looking to hear back from us before the
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
full committee so do we want to meet one
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
more time before then
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
to see if there's anything else that we
 
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.790 align:start position:0%
to see if there's anything else that we
wanted

01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
thoughts how long do you think it will
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
take to get I'm not sure how readily
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
available some of this stuff is how long
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
do you think it would take approximately
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so do we want to play and maybe to
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
all right I think that kind of concludes
 
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
for us today unless anybody else has
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
anything thank you all so much I really
 
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:22.709 align:start position:0%
anything thank you all so much I really
appreciate

01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
