conversation
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of State is actually a
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
pretty good sized state agency we do a
 
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
lot more than just elections and I think
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's important for the committee to
 
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
leading off our administrative offices
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
of course are in on the second floor of
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
the State House room 204 just down the
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
hall from The Andy room on reps Hall
 
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
um you're welcome to come in there
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
anytime like I said we usually have a
 
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
candy dish on the table that's full so
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
if you need a little
 
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
you know a little energy that's a good
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
place to go and get it
 
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.130 align:start position:0%
place to go and get it
um

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
in that office we receive many of the
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
filings that are required by Statute
 
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.370 align:start position:0%
filings that are required by Statute
um

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380 align:start position:0%

00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
everything from justices of the piece
 
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
and notary applications to obtaining
 
00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:17.509 align:start position:0%
and notary applications to obtaining
apostills

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
apostills
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
which are a certification of notaries
 
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
that are signing documents usually for
 
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
foreign countries mostly related to
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
adoptions and things like that
 
00:09:31.449 --> 00:09:31.459 align:start position:0%
uh we cater to the governor and Council
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
we're in attendance at all of their
 
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
meetings taking the minutes
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
and so we handle a lot of their needs as
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
we have a corporations division which
 
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
which registers all business entities in
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
they're located in the annex we take up
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
probably 75 percent of the third floor
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
in that building and we also have the
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Securities which regulates
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
dealer Brokers those people that sell
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
financial instruments and they also are
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for some enforcement
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
activity in fact it's the enforcement
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
activity and the fines that they receive
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
that actually fund the operation
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
Securities collects probably 40 million
 
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.250 align:start position:0%
Securities collects probably 40 million
dollars

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459 align:start position:0%
uh in uh in registration fees and all of
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
that money goes directly to the general
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
fund so it's a major uh Revenue
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
generator in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
up on the state hospital grounds the the
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
management division
 
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.130 align:start position:0%
management division

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
you know we manage agency records that
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
are in the process of becoming dormant
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're no longer needed by the agency
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
but if they are we'll retrieve those
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
records for the agency and make sure
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
that they get them and then retrieve
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
them whenever they're done
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
uh we also have some of the state's most
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
historical precious documents up there
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
including the ratification document
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
which actually made the United States
 
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
um a tremendous amount of civil war
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
records revolutionary war records I
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
think the oldest document we have dates
 
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:24.980 align:start position:0%
back to the 1630s
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
and so it's a it's a fascinating place
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
Vital Records I mentioned we keep track
 
00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
of marriages deaths births
 
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh just statistical records that we
 
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
share primarily with the Department of
 
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and uh that's
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
also an important division within the
 
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.230 align:start position:0%
also an important division within the
office

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
and then finally uh we have a
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
significant part of our elections
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
division up there we'll refer to it
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
often as the Hava office
 
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.140 align:start position:0%
stands for the help America vote act
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
which was passed in 2002
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
and that act requires us to uh required
 
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
us to create and maintain a centralized
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
voter database of all voters in the
 
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
it required that we have accessible
 
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
voting equipment in every polling place
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
it requires that we conduct poll worker
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
training it requires that we educate
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
voters on elections and election laws
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
and there's also a provision in there to
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
fund the enforcement activity that the
 
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:47.660 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office May engage
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
related to enforcement of the help
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
America vote act in the state of New
 
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.030 align:start position:0%
America vote act in the state of New
Hampshire

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
we received significant funds when the
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
Act was created
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
and periodically we have received
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
additional funds related to the help of
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
America vote act those additional funds
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
usually require a state match of funds
 
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:13.820 align:start position:0%
currently the balance in the fund is
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
12.8 million dollars
 
00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:19.019 align:start position:0%
um and there is another appropriation
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
that we have not received yet of roughly
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
another million dollars
 
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
you may have heard some issues related
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
to funds from Hava in the past one of
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
them comes up regularly when there's a
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
race for secretary of state that this
 
00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:39.139 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State's office
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
inappropriately paid a million dollars
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
to fund construction up at the state
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
archives we have been through a couple
 
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
of audits on that uh you know on that
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
subject the most recent one was the
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
Federal audit
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
that specific to the Haba funds and they
 
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
concluded that those have a funds were
 
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019 align:start position:0%
appropriately expended and in fact
 
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
spending the million dollars
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
as prepaid rent for the facility at the
 
00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:14.459 align:start position:0%
help in the archives actually save the
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
taxpayers quite a bit of money by taking
 
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
that route and like I said there's no
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
question now that the way that money was
 
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
spent was appropriate and uh any subject
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
any suggestion to the contrary is simply
 
00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:29.449 align:start position:0%
any suggestion to the contrary is simply
inaccurate

00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:29.459 align:start position:0%
inaccurate
 
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
the the legislature when the help
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
America vote Act was passed uh
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
created the election Fund in the state
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire where that money is
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
deposited and the legislature determined
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh that we would only spend a portion of
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
those funds in every any given year to
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements actually the
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
mandates of the help America vote Act
 
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
with the policy being that we would keep
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
as much of the principle as far into the
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
future as possible to fund those
 
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:05.660 align:start position:0%
programs so that we would not have to
 
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
fund the federal mandate by General
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
funds in the future so here we are 20
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
years later we still have a healthy
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
balance in that fund which allows us to
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
spend roughly a million dollars a year
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh that million dollars is spent on the
 
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
staff required to run the Java program
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
those are the individuals that that
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
maintain the Statewide voter database
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's a project it's staff that are
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
involved in the extensive local election
 
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
official training that we put on every
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
year the funds paid for the Statewide
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
voter registration database and we're
 
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
currently using funds to replace the
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
Legacy system that was built in 2006 of
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
the new system the new voter database
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
will be completed in 2024 I'm sorry 2023
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
sometime this summer we will have the
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
new the new database in place that
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
project was put out to bid and I believe
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
the price tag on is
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
some are close to four million dollars
 
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019 align:start position:0%
so it's not a you know it's not an
 
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
inexpensive project
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
the money also pays for the accessible
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
voting equipment that you see in your
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
polling place when you go and vote
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
uh it that there's actually a white tent
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
that is set up and then when a voter
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
just a voter with disabilities goes in
 
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
to vote on the equipment they're able to
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
use a touch screen pad to make their
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
choices on their ballot and when they
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
are completed they they push a button
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
and an actual ballot goes through the
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
printer printing device and the printer
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
will make marks in the oval on the
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
ballot and then the disabled voter is
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
able to take that ballot and run it
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
through an optical scan voting machine
 
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
if that's what your polling place uses
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
or or directly in a Ballot Box if it's a
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
hand count town so uh the idea is that
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
the you know we want the voter with a
 
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:21.140 align:start position:0%
disability to be able to vote
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
independently and freely without
 
00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
assistance if that is possible
 
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
I think we're on our second or third
 
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
generation of accessible voting device
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the polling place and again that
 
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:36.860 align:start position:0%
equipment is paid forth with ahava funds
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
for the 2022 election it
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
we had an online system which was
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
available to voters with site
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities where the voter similar to
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
a uocaba vote or a military who oversees
 
00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
voter who are authorized to receive
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
their ballot by email
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh can then print it off vote on it and
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
then return it through a regular mail
 
00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:05.870 align:start position:0%
then return it through a regular mail
the

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
voters besite disabilities were able to
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
vote in a similar manner so they could
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
receive their ballot at home by email
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
have a program on their computer that
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
would allow them to make the choices of
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
their candidates on the ballot they
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
could then print a ballot off and then
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
mail it back to the town clerks that it
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
and then I met as I mentioned uh you
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
know our
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
poll worker training is quite extensive
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
and those uh those training sessions are
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:47.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
so the the elections division which is
 
00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
where we interact a great deal with this
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh committee
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
um you know the activities in general
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we conduct related to elections are
 
00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:10.580 align:start position:0%
uh receiving campaign Finance filings
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
and we have an online
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
filing system
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
which has been problematic and the
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that we inherited
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
through the sale of a company a vendor
 
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
who has not been maintaining the system
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
properly for us I believe that they're
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
incompetent the contract with them
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
expires this spring and we already have
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
plans to replace the campaign Finance
 
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
system and that will be completed well
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
before the 20
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
2024 election cycle so that we have a
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
system that is running properly and
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully glitch free but I know it has
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
been embarrassing the way that uh that
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
system has worked in fact that same
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
vendor was uh was responsible for our
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
elections database and our corporations
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
database and we had significant issues
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
with them uh in both respects uh we were
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
able to get out from the corporations
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
contract with them last
 
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh last year we have a new vendor that
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
has completely upgraded that system and
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
it is working fantastic right now so
 
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
your constituents that will be doing
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
business filings should have a really
 
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
good experience now uh interacting with
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office in that
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
regard and then the elections database
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
of course is our users are local
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
election officials primarily Town clerks
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
and supervisors of the checklist and the
 
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:45.020 align:start position:0%
new system that we're building for them
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
is going to make their life a lot easier
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
too so we're really excited about that
 
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
um we received candidate filings in the
 
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:56.830 align:start position:0%
um we received candidate filings in the
office

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:00.059 align:start position:0%
we issue notices to voters and all the
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
instructional Publications uh to the
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
local election officials that are
 
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
required by Statute
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
we prepare all of the ballots for the
 
00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419 align:start position:0%
elections and that involves receiving
 
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:15.140 align:start position:0%
the candidate filings uh
 
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
preparing the ballot with the candidates
 
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.150 align:start position:0%
preparing the ballot with the candidates
names

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
names
 
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.710 align:start position:0%
names
we

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
incorporate the appropriate rotations
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
both for candidate name order and party
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
columns that appear on the ballot and we
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
do all of the proofing that is necessary
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the ballots are
 
00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:34.490 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the ballots are
accurate

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that um
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
that that's completed we deliver
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
the that information to the printer we
 
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
oversee the printing process which is
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
done by a local printer
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
we ship the ballots to the local
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
election officials when they're ready
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
make sure that they get there on time so
 
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
that especially the absentee ballots can
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
get out in a timely manner
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
we undertake again significant election
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
official training we conduct recounts
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
and then in the end we certify the
 
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:20.690 align:start position:0%
and then in the end we certify the
results

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
you know a number of the the initiatives
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
that are currently ongoing and have been
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh since uh last year uh we talked about
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
replacing the voter registration
 
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.409 align:start position:0%
replacing the voter registration
database

00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
um and that will have additional uh uh
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
ability and capability one thing that we
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
are looking at because I know it's a
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
topic of of this legislature and it was
 
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh during the last session but the
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
ability to have some kind of a voter
 
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
access portal where voters can interact
 
00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
with local election officials on things
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
like filing voter registration
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
applications uh maybe being able to
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
request absentee ballots and things like
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
that and as that is created we'll
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
certainly seek the input of the you know
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the legislators
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
and voters and election officials on
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
what that might look like
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
we're currently looking at the next
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
because we all know the devices that are
 
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:33.620 align:start position:0%
being used right now are decades old
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
they are reaching the end of their
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
useful life although I think we could
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
squeeze a couple more elections out of
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
them you know we are testing other
 
00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:45.980 align:start position:0%
devices in the last
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh general election we tested an open
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
source voting device which is brand new
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
it's not I don't know that's being used
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the country uh we had a
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
positive experience with that by the way
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
open source for those of you that don't
 
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
know is uh is software that is not
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
proprietary so that anybody that is
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
interested in looking at the code and
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
how the code programs the machined
 
00:24:17.169 --> 00:24:17.179 align:start position:0%
account ballots can actually do that
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
there have been concerns about the
 
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:22.340 align:start position:0%
proprietary code which the major
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
companies that
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
provide ball accounting devices used
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
because you can't see how the software
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
is interacting with the counting of the
 
00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:33.049 align:start position:0%
is interacting with the counting of the
ballot

00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:34.010 align:start position:0%
ballot
um

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
the software the open source software
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
that we used I think worked really
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
really well but the hardware design of
 
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
the actual equipment that was used to
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know run the ballots through did
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
have issues and those will have to be
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
addressed before that device could be
 
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
addressed before that device could be
used

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire elections on a
 
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
uh we will be testing additional devices
 
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:01.940 align:start position:0%
in the in the
 
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:04.940 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections this spring and fall
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
the ballot commission is meeting
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the battle law commission is
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
the agency that is approved that will
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
approve ballot counting devices uh they
 
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
are going to they've approved the device
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured by Dominion uh in the towns
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
of Milford and Londonderry
 
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
in March and uh and they're going to be
 
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:28.460 align:start position:0%
looking at a couple of other devices
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
manufactured by a company called es and
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
S and and another company clear ballot
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh tomorrow and so we'll see if they
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
give those approvals or not and if they
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
do I expect we'll be testing those this
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
March as well
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh e-poll books are have been approved
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
by the legislature for use we are seeing
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
growing use by municipalities uh we're
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
up to 15 polling places now that are
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
actually using uh e-poll books in the
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
poll books representing about 126 000
 
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.070 align:start position:0%
poll books representing about 126 000
voters

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.029 align:start position:0%
voters
um

00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
for the new members and E public an
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
electronic poll book is a an alarm an
 
00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:23.779 align:start position:0%
electronic check-in device that is used
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh by a voter that can actually present
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
their driver's license and have the
 
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:30.980 align:start position:0%
device you know record that information
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh so that it doesn't have to be typed
 
00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
in by the polar by the by the ballot
 
00:26:36.179 --> 00:26:37.130 align:start position:0%
in by the polar by the by the ballot
Clerk

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
Clerk
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
and then the voter can proceed to vote
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
the benefit to the towns is that it
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
eliminates the need for lines set up by
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
alphabet a voter can go to the shortest
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
line and check in and then at the end of
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
the night when the polls close the
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
a Pogba can be closed out and then very
 
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
quickly a printout of the number of
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
Voters that checked in is available and
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist don't
 
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
have to go through and count the number
 
00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:12.380 align:start position:0%
of Voters that checked in on each page
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
we're currently working on an interface
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
program so that the local election
 
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
officials at the municipal level will be
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
able to take the data from the
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
electronic poll book and actually
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
link it right to the voter database so
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
it will save you know it will save a
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of time in entering
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
that data manually into the elections
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
database so you know we're pretty
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
excited about that
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
the use of the poll books is still done
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
in parallel with a paper checklist
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
we want to be absolutely sure before we
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
go to just the e-poll book uh
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
by itself that it's going to be
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
Fail-Safe and that there is that there
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
is a way to retrieve voters who have
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
checked in prior to an e-pol book
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
failure that's been an issue in some
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
other states that have used these and so
 
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
we're just being tremendously cautious
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
until we can
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
reach a certain confidence level that
 
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
we've expanded poll worker training and
 
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to do that we do
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
trainings in person in all regions of
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
the state we're using WebEx and actually
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
recording video training videos that
 
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
we've put up on uh
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
YouTube and other places our website
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
where the local election officials can
 
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
obtain them view them at their own uh
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
you know at their own pleasure uh and um
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's working well
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh we're we have growing efforts on
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
voter education last year we hired a
 
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
communications director Anna Faye she
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
did a tremendous amount of postings on
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
social media we had a bunch of election
 
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
fun facts hopefully you got to see those
 
00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
on Twitter and YouTube
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
but those were really well received
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of work with the
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
traditional media we're engaging more
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
with speaking engagements to groups like
 
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
rotary clubs or you know anybody that
 
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:30.500 align:start position:0%
you know wants to learn about elections
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I would you know offer that to you
 
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
as well if you would like us to come to
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
your community to give a presentation
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're certainly more than happy to do
 
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.630 align:start position:0%
we're certainly more than happy to do
that

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
we have plans to engage in a poll worker
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
recruitment initiative this year uh you
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
know we're pretty excited about an
 
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.299 align:start position:0%
opportunity where we might be able to
 
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
focus on Veterans primarily you know
 
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
people that have helped defend our
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
country uh you know and serve to
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
promote democracy and involve them now
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
that they're retired from service to you
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
know help out you know continue their
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
civic duty in polling place and so we'll
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
be working with veterans groups on that
 
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.769 align:start position:0%
be working with veterans groups on that
initiative

00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:18.419 align:start position:0%
uh we continue to enhance enhance the
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
website we've done a tremendous amount
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
in that regard uh it's a lot more user
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
friendly uh more importantly it is
 
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
completely Ada accessible so that
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities can go on
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
and access all parts of the elections
 
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.470 align:start position:0%
and access all parts of the elections
website

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
it did require us to remove a lot of
 
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
content until we can make it Ada
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
accessible and as we complete that we're
 
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059 align:start position:0%
putting that information back up we are
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
going to be working on a municipal
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
template that spends something that has
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
been suggested so that we can offer the
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in New Hampshire a
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
uniform website template related to
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
um we continue to work with
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
post-election audits that was a policy
 
00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:15.059 align:start position:0%
decision of the legislature that
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
required Us in the last election to do
 
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh 10
 
00:31:23.049 --> 00:31:23.059 align:start position:0%
state representative districts
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
it required us to take
 
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.230 align:start position:0%
it required us to take
10

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
state representative districts that had
 
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
to be recounted and from those ballots
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
count an office a higher office on the
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
ballot either
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
Governor U.S Senate Congress
 
00:31:44.409 --> 00:31:44.419 align:start position:0%
uh maybe executive Council
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
so we completed that for 10 Towns which
 
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:49.940 align:start position:0%
were selected
 
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we had a high speed
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
scanner conduct an audit of four
 
00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
polling places uh in the around the
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire of various sizes
 
00:32:03.299 --> 00:32:06.669 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire of various sizes
those

00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
audits were very positive I mean they
 
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
did they did validate the counts uh you
 
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:15.620 align:start position:0%
know on the ballots uh as being accurate
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
which was good the legislature also
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
required us to start keeping track of
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
undervotes and overvotes on the ballot
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
which had to be reported by the
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then as we did
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
recounts we also kept track of that
 
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:33.860 align:start position:0%
information during the recount
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
and it gave us quite a bit more
 
00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:38.630 align:start position:0%
and it gave us quite a bit more
confidence

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
in the count and it also uh you know we
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
had the issue in Manchester Ward 6 where
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
with between the Audits and the and the
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
information uh that was collected
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
related to undervotes and over votes
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
made it very clear that there was an
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
undercount of ballots in that Ward six
 
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.370 align:start position:0%
undercount of ballots in that Ward six
uh

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:03.299 align:start position:0%
uh race
 
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
it put me in a very difficult position
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
because you know we're only allowed one
 
00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.950 align:start position:0%
because you know we're only allowed one
recount

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
recount
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
um but we knew that there was a very
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
obvious error that all of the ballots
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
were not counted uh in that particular
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
race to me it didn't matter which party
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
was involved you know in the outcome
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
um but I had to struggle whether you
 
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.090 align:start position:0%
um but I had to struggle whether you
know

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
you know we were just going to go with a
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
status quo or whether because we knew
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
there was an error that we would force
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
the issue allow allow it to be taken to
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
court where a judge did decide that the
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
right thing to do was to count all of
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
the ballots in that race which is what
 
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.389 align:start position:0%
the ballots in that race which is what
happened

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:33:44.399 --> 00:33:49.250 align:start position:0%
happened
um

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
the last thing that that I'll mention is
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
that related to our elections
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
initiatives is that we did have a a
 
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:01.940 align:start position:0%
special committee on voter confidence
 
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
which was a sounding board they you know
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
they went out around the state listened
 
00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:09.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
from all
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
political parties and ideologies and you
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
know they heard a lot of issues related
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
to the elections that uh you know in
 
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
some some situations they were venting
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
sessions and I think that was a healthy
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
thing to go through they collected a lot
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
of information a lot of data a lot of
 
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
emails a lot of testimony uh the very
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
diverse committee got together
 
00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
and over several meeting sessions did
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
come up with a report that was signed by
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
all but one of the members of the
 
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.190 align:start position:0%
all but one of the members of the
committee

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
uh uh the the member that did not sign
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
also issued a report uh which was not
 
00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.099 align:start position:0%
too much different from the report that
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
was issued by the committee itself but I
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
I there were no surprises in what they
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
recommended uh to me and I don't think
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
that there will be surprises to you but
 
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
I think it'll be really useful
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
information for the committee when
 
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
you're you know looking at the issues
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
that are going to be before you to see
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
what this bipartisan Group found uh uh
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know when they went around and
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
conducted that exercise so I think there
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
will be some positive things that come
 
00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:22.700 align:start position:0%
out of that and I look forward to that
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
with policy decisions is that I want to
 
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
focus on the local election officials
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
because the legislature has been
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
throwing a lot at them over the last few
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
bienniums they are required to do a lot
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
more work there is a lot more scrutiny
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
on what they do I think we have to
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
remember that for the most part these
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
individuals are volunteers they do the
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
job because they want to participate in
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
Civic activity
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
um they do it be like because they like
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
it it's a social event for them
 
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that we continue to
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
burden them and make the job more
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
difficult and and place a lot more uh
 
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
you know challenging scrutiny and
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
observation on what they do I think
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a harder job finding
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
people to do that job and so you know
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's a challenge that I think we have
 
00:36:28.089 --> 00:36:28.099 align:start position:0%
to be cognizant of as we move forward
 
00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:31.619 align:start position:0%
and and just make sure that you know
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
that the people that really make the
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
elections in New Hampshire work are
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
treated properly and that we you know
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
that we make their job easier if we can
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
not harder and and just recognize the
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
important role that they play in this
 
00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:46.609 align:start position:0%
important role that they play in this
process

00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
so with that Mr chairman I think that
 
00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599 align:start position:0%
was a mouthful
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
we were all here to answer questions if
 
00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:55.220 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
Aaron has been working a lot on uh the
 
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes that will be appearing on
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
the backs of the bills that you receive
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
and Patty has been doing a tremendous
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
amount with the reporting that's being
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
required at the federal level for the
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
election assistance commission and that
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
information includes uh you know the the
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
you know the number of absentee voters
 
00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:25.220 align:start position:0%
we had the number of uh
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
verification letters that we had to mail
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
out for voters that you know registered
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
or obtained ballots using affidavits and
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:37:35.579 --> 00:37:36.170 align:start position:0%
things like that
um

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
but we're all here as a resource you
 
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
know you you search any one of us out uh
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
Aaron and Patty will probably be the
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
ones showing up to testify on
 
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
legislation uh I'll be here this
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon just to uh you know kind of
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
continue with the orientation on how
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
that process will work from our end and
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
your end so we're happy to answer any
 
00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.690 align:start position:0%
your end so we're happy to answer any
questions

00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr secretary are there
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative Potomac Brown thank
 
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
welcome welcome back uh here we go again
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
I I want to ask about the
 
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.050 align:start position:0%
I I want to ask about the
the

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
um Dominion
 
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.530 align:start position:0%
um Dominion
um

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
ballot Counting
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
equipment that will be used in
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and in Milton uh if you know
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
the model number offhand if you don't
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's okay too we can find that
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
it's the Dominion image cast
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
um it is the device that has been
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
criticized in the past by by certain
 
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.510 align:start position:0%
criticized in the past by by certain
groups

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
groups
 
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.050 align:start position:0%
groups
um

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's it's a device that we're
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
going to test ultimately the ballot
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
commission makes the final call on which
 
00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
devices are going to be approved in New
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Dominion device is one of
 
00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.190 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Dominion device is one of
four

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
um the ballot commission has set
 
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
criteria that they are looking at
 
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
and I think their plan is
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
probably to decide on one maybe two
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
devices uh
 
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
ideally we want to be able to just print
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
one style ballot for the State of New
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that can be read by any
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
devices that are used as opposed to
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
having different machines that require
 
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
different ballot Styles because that
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
will make our job a lot more complicated
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
if we have to do that
 
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
a follow-up Mr chairman follow up and
 
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
how will they be evaluated during and or
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
after the elections in Londonderry and
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
Milton the
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
the the tests that we're doing is just a
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
proof of comp concept we want to make
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
sure that the devices are going to work
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
well in a New Hampshire election number
 
00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.550 align:start position:0%
well in a New Hampshire election number
one

00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
excuse me number two the
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
the ballot commission has set criteria
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
that for the devices that will be unique
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire some of the criteria
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
some examples are that the devices
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
cannot have
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
any modem capability
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
no ability to connect to the interfa
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
Internet or Wi-Fi so that's a
 
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.730 align:start position:0%
Internet or Wi-Fi so that's a
requirement

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
they have to be Standalone units
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
the results from a machine will be
 
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
printed from that machine they won't get
 
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
sent to another location where the
 
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
results will be aggregated
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
by a central device
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
if multiple devices are used in a
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the tapes or the results that are
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
printed off the machine will have to be
 
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
added together at the polling place and
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
not uh you know not interconnected those
 
00:40:59.690 --> 00:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
are examples
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
once that's done
 
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.349 align:start position:0%
once that's done
the

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
the machines will have to meet
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
the new requirements technical
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
requirements that are established by the
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
election assistance Commission
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
the latest requirements have not been
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
completely approved yet but we expect
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
that that approval is going to be
 
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.290 align:start position:0%
that that approval is going to be
forthcoming

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
forthcoming
 
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:23.579 align:start position:0%
and then once the election assistance
 
00:41:23.579 --> 00:41:25.630 align:start position:0%
and then once the election assistance
commission

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
establishes those
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer of the device is going
 
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:32.300 align:start position:0%
to have to take it before a certified
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
technical Laboratory
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
the inner workings and the software of
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
the devices are tested and validated and
 
00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:46.490 align:start position:0%
the devices are tested and validated and
certified

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative boom
 
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the law that was
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
passed last year which was my bill on
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
letting the town Clerks
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
notify the Secretary of State on on
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
State Rep filings daily how did that
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
work out
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
I think that worked out overall it
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
worked out pretty well we were receiving
 
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
the uh the filings by email uh pretty
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
much every day and then we received the
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
hard copy days later so
 
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.450 align:start position:0%
hard copy days later so
um

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
I think I I think I'll have to look but
 
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
we were publishing putting that
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
information up on the website as we were
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
receiving it so hopefully you know the
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
candidates knew who their competition
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
was earlier in the process
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to say so this is my
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
seventh term and I typically help other
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
people running so I look at those
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
results they've never been up faster
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
really well done
 
00:42:49.089 --> 00:42:49.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
um look uh looking to the situation
 
00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:58.700 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 6
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
and to the general problem that might
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
arise when there's a obvious error in a
 
00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:05.150 align:start position:0%
arise when there's a obvious error in a
recount

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
recount
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
um but we're only permitted of course
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
one recount do you think we have the
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
right process for dealing with that
 
00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:11.809 align:start position:0%
right process for dealing with that
situation

00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
um or do we need to stipulate what the
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
process should be when there's an
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
obvious error in a recount more
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
precisely than is now stipulated
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
I think that the process we have uh in
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
place works and and we may have to tweak
 
00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:31.700 align:start position:0%
it just a little bit
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me to accommodate
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
you know the situation happened in
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 6.
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
what just being a little more specific
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
on what happened there was when the
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
return of votes came in from that
 
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
particular Ward it did not have the
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
undervotes listed on the page we did not
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
get that until sometime later the other
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
the other uh return of votes forms from
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
the awards in Manchester had that
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
information on it
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
when we collected uh the information
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
during the recount
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
um you know we had those numbers
 
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:15.380 align:start position:0%
uh we had the numbers from the recount
 
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
itself but then when we did the the
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
audit you know where you know we had the
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
number of uh ballots that were cast and
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh and the number of undervotes and
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
everything for the the higher office
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
that we had counted when we when we
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
looked at the different
 
00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:38.579 align:start position:0%
numbers that we had for ballots cast it
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
was clear that
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
in the recount we were we were well
 
00:44:42.599 --> 00:44:44.150 align:start position:0%
in the recount we were we were well
under

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
the other numbers that we had
 
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
if we had not done those other exercises
 
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
we would have never known uh and that
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
election would have you know would have
 
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
been results would have been certified
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't have known any better
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
but if the Dilemma was in this case we
 
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
knew that that there was an error based
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
on this extra information so you know
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
knowing that I think that there are
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
things that we can do uh
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
in running the elections using that
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
extra information
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
to to validate the results of the
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
recount before we actually announce the
 
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.150 align:start position:0%
recount before we actually announce the
numbers

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
um and I think you know that's where we
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.190 align:start position:0%
need to be
um

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.470 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
and I'll just leave it at that for now
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow-up please follow up
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
um to my understanding it correctly that
 
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
the um the new audit bill was the one
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
that gave us that extra information
 
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
yes that helps uh because Manchester
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
Ward 6 was one of the towns that was
 
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.309 align:start position:0%
Ward 6 was one of the towns that was
audited

00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
audited
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and and that was by chance I mean it
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
wasn't because we thought there was an
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
issue there it's just that was that was
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
one of the awards that was selected
 
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.210 align:start position:0%
one of the awards that was selected
um

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
I I will say that too that we had a
 
00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
record number of recounts uh in 2022
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
there were 31 recounts that were
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
requested and then on top of that uh we
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
had these audits that were going on at
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
the same time so uh I think we managed
 
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
the logistics of that really really well
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know Patty you know I
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
think did a tremendous job helping to
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
organize that entire effort and uh you
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
know we had a lot of new uh
 
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
recount workers helping the process so
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
they were on a learning curve themselves
 
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
um but I think we're really better
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
prepared for the future because of that
 
00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:47.420 align:start position:0%
experience uh we have a much larger pool
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
of people that we can call on to help us
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
conduct recounts and uh I think we're
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to be better for the experience
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
that we had in this last election
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:06.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh secretary with
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
the aging and uh retiring individuals
 
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
who are serving right now as election
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
officials in their towns uh is there any
 
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
effort to try and Recruit new uh poll
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
workers or uh if so what type of process
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
is going on to try and do that
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be an effort that we're
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
going to organize this year so that
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
we're well prepared for 2024 and as I
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there is a program
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
that we're moving on working with
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
veterans groups to encourage veterans
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
you know who
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's a large part in helping us protect
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
our democracy actually participate in
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
the election process itself those
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
individuals that have been critical of
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
the election process or have concerns or
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we're encouraging them to
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
participate as well
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's an important role
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
and if you actually participate in the
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
election and see uh how it works and and
 
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:14.099 align:start position:0%
see the checks and balances that are
 
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
really underway on Election Day in every
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
you have a better understanding of you
 
00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
know how it works and how it really is
 
00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:27.980 align:start position:0%
difficult to have a conspiratorial uh
 
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
manipulation of the election results and
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
you know you know we have to engage
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
the general population and help them
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
understand that process to help
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
build confidence
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
um so yeah we're going to be coming up
 
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:43.700 align:start position:0%
with initiatives doing a lot more
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
through the media encouraging people to
 
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
participate in the process and putting
 
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
out pieces that are educational so that
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
people don't want to participate at
 
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
least they can read about how the
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
process works
 
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.550 align:start position:0%
process works
foreign

00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman let me just add too that you
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
know there are materials that we place
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
on your desk you know there's an
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
election procedure manual there's a law
 
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
book with an addendum that provides the
 
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
changes that were made during the last
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
legislative session uh you have a state
 
00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
constitution and a political calendar
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
which has all the important dates
 
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
related to elections in New Hampshire
 
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
um the machines that you're testing for
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
the the Dominion and all the other ones
 
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
that you're testing will they have the
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
ability to do ranked Choice voting in in
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
the event that is passed in in New
 
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.010 align:start position:0%
the event that is passed in in New
Hampshire

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:48.740 align:start position:0%
I believe that the the newer devices
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
which are digital scan as opposed to
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
Optical scan
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh have the ability to uh
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
to count ranked choice
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
voting towns but again it depends on
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
you know how that's going to look so you
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
know if New Hampshire were
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
that the problem with New Hampshire and
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
ranked Choice voting is that we have
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
some offices where there are many
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
candidates uh
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know primarily state representative
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
and so the question is how how is that
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
going to look you know how many you know
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
how many how many
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
choices as a person going to be able to
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
make is it the first five and then you
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
cut it off but there may be limitations
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
to to those machines the the new the
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
digital scan models are have the ability
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
to record images of every ballot
 
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
that goes through it has the the ability
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
to isolate a particular race and and the
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
marks that are made for that particular
 
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
race uh has the ability to
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
pull up
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
marks on the ballot that are
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
questionable so you know it starts off
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
with a completely filled in oval and
 
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
then it moves down the line until you
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
know you reach a point where it's just a
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know just a dot in the oval so
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
um there is a there is a a lot more that
 
00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:18.020 align:start position:0%
those devices can do
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
whether we use that opportunity or not
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
is is a policy decision
 
00:51:27.049 --> 00:51:27.059 align:start position:0%
um but you know if we do go that route
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know there are
 
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.089 align:start position:0%
uh you know there are
uh

00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know the the committee has a lot of
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
options on how we decide what the policy
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
is going to be and how we count ballots
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up this isn't actually a question
 
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
but I do commend the recounts uh system
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
that you add I participated in it and it
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
was very well done and
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
Patty did a great job everybody else on
 
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
the team so I would urge all the people
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
on this committee to do that because it
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
was very educational yeah thank you
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank Patty and Aaron
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
because they were a really big part of
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative work
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
um secretary Mr secretary um
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
you mentioned involving the veterans and
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
doing that has there been any
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
consideration with the requirements for
 
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
civics education in the high school
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
level and and of involving high school
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
students in the voting process and and
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and there has
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
been discussion but there has been no
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
movement on that yet but but I think
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's a logical next place to go and uh
 
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
you know we will make ourselves
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
available to go to any high school or
 
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.829 align:start position:0%
available to go to any high school or
college

00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
you know that wants to have a
 
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
conversation about elections
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you know any time that we have an
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity or an invitation to do that
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
we take advantage of it um but I think
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
that it would be a good idea to maybe
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
come up with a curriculum in a more
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
formal way you know related to Civics
 
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr secretary this is
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:48.290 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
just gonna hang out yeah why not
 
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
I got some things I need counseled can
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
you help me
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
all right nuts and bolts times I don't
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
have to go through my first item because
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
everybody uses the mics correctly and I
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
am so happy
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
um done speaking
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen a lot and if you get
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
enough of them lit up then nobody can
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
hear anything on the feed
 
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.589 align:start position:0%
hear anything on the feed
decorum

00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
decorum
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
these are instruments of the devil
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
so silence or dead or off or whatever
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
you want to do when they're in here but
 
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
we should never ever hear one it's
 
00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
incredibly embarrassing especially if
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
you have a funny ringtone
 
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
a good friend of mine
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
who may or may not be another committee
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
chair has one ringtone set for I don't
 
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
know some radio personality and it goes
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
oh my God who the hell cares
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a hearing that thing
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
went off I could have strangled them
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
he had a reporter over his shoulder not
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
good so just yeah kill him
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
Bones on silent food drinks
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
we don't do it
 
00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
um if you've got to bring water you can
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
put them underneath
 
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
it'd be nothing worse than having to
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
stop a public hearing so we could mop up
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
a mess so we don't do it if you need to
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
get a drink have a water bottle
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
underneath or just step out for a few
 
00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.010 align:start position:0%
underneath or just step out for a few
minutes

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:24.020 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
Electronics during public hearings
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
were not on our laptops or looking
 
00:55:30.049 --> 00:55:30.059 align:start position:0%
things up on our phone we are
 
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
respectfully and politely receiving
 
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
testimony can have them up when we're
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
actually debating each other during
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
executive session but never during a
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
drawers the committee rooms right on the
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
other side of that wall and in there you
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
will find a drawer with your name on it
 
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
if you don't let me know open the drawer
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
there should be a key and you may find
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
other treasure as representative bum
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
discovered this morning there were some
 
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
leftovers in there
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
fortunately they were not perishable as
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
far as we know it but yeah you might
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at that and uh clean
 
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:14.099 align:start position:0%
it out
 
00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
when people are testifying that there
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
are times you're not going to be here
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
you've gone to another committee to
 
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
testify on their own bill or you had to
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
come in late or you double booked it
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
happens so when you come into the room
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody's there testifying just wait
 
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.099 align:start position:0%
until they're done and then come up to
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
take your seat to do otherwise is
 
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.690 align:start position:0%
take your seat to do otherwise is
distracting

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:37.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
when you are interested in a bill before
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
this committee or are a sponsor or
 
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor that wasn't all you dude but
 
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:48.140 align:start position:0%
you did demonstrate
 
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
so when um you need to introduce your
 
00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
bill to this committee you got a choice
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
to make you can go down there and
 
00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.410 align:start position:0%
to make you can go down there and
testify

00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
or stay up here so that you can ask
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
questions afterwards but you cannot do
 
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
both so never go down there to testify
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
and then go back to your seat we don't
 
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:10.220 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
okay the part you really want to know
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
about how's the schedule going to work
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
what is our workload I wish I could tell
 
00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.170 align:start position:0%
what is our workload I wish I could tell
you

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
um officer legislative Services has some
 
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:26.579 align:start position:0%
challenges they got a stack of new
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys who necessarily are not as
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
quick as the older attorneys who are
 
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
used to the process and a lot of them
 
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
also got sick right when the um the lsrs
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
were hit in the office there is still a
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
few hundred bills not assigned to
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
committees by the speaker because we
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
don't have them
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
so we will do that as quickly as we
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
receive them like when they hit the
 
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.390 align:start position:0%
receive them like when they hit the
office

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
they're done immediately but so I can't
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
tell you how heavy our workload is going
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
to be because I don't have the bills
 
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
So the plan is we're going to meet
 
00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays if we have bills we're going to
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
meet Tuesdays if we have bills to exec
 
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet Tuesdays if I've got
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
a bunch of bills we'll do a full day
 
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
um because we don't know what comes
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
afterwards and what we don't want to do
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
is be in panic mode as deadlines
 
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.089 align:start position:0%
is be in panic mode as deadlines
approach

00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
so I like to front load it heavy and
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
then relax later on and maybe get a week
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
or so off as we get near the crossover
 
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.770 align:start position:0%
or so off as we get near the crossover
deadline

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:32.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
the executive sessions
 
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
here's how those are going to work now
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
this language in the calendar every time
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
we meet that says something like
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
executive session may occur throughout
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
that is to facilitate if we get a super
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
easy bill
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
and representative Lynn and I agree on
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
what the outcome is going to be
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
we can together decide to exec it that
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
day we are unable to do that without
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
that language on the calendar that says
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
there may be an executive session so
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's why that's in there
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
in this community that's excuse me
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
probably going to be rare most of the
 
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
time they're going to be put up so
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
you'll get like you got a notice for
 
00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
today you will get a separate notice
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
that says election law executive hearing
 
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
with a listing of the bills that we're
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
the I'd like to
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
do the two that we're going to hear this
 
00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
afternoon next Tuesday and just
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
clear the work that's that's what I'm
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
I think I've covered everything about
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
how we're gonna operate do you have
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.559 --> 00:59:58.820 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:59:58.820 --> 00:59:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:02.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
hey you know what I just finished my bit
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
so your timing is awesome
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
so let's hear from her and you guys can
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
ask me questions afterwards because I'm
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
no no no maybe they'll forget them
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone I'm Ann Edwards
 
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office and
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
we have the election law unit at our
 
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
office our election law unit is uh
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
staffed by two full-time attorneys of
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
which I am not one of them
 
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
I am one of the supervisors who works
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
with them and also a full-time criminal
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
investigator and a full-time
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
investigative paralegal I've worked in
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elections for the Attorney
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
General's office for more than 25 years
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm the institutional knowledge or
 
01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
perhaps just to institutionalized
 
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
attorney over there who works closely
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
our two attorneys are currently in a
 
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
criminal case mediation today that
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
involves an election matter
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
and I just want to give you some quick
 
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
statistics so you can understand what we
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
do as Secretary of State Scanlon said
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
we're the election law enforcement so we
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
work very very closely with the election
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State's office on
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
interpretation of Elections law because
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
we're also their attorney we provide
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
advice to the Secretary of State in all
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
of those areas that he described
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
including Securities and corporations we
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
are his general attorney but the
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
election law unit Works closely with him
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
on the interpretation of election law
 
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
and the enforcement of it
 
01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
one of the areas that we have seen a lot
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
of action in the last year and many of
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
you have may have heard about this and
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
if not you will hear more about it is as
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State said the campaign
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
filing system has been challenged shall
 
01:01:59.210 --> 01:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
we say and so it's been challenging in
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
our office to try to deal with the
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
violations of the filings that different
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
candidates and campaigns and political
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
committees have had and so we have right
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
now 1600 violations for 2020. that's not
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
1600 people or campaigns it's 1600
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
violations so one campaign might have a
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
couple of violations the bulk of those
 
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
violations is that the reports are late
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily uncommon and so
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
what we are in the process of doing is
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
we are not going to flood the market
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
with sixteen hundred letters all at once
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
but over the next two months we will be
 
01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
issuing the letters to the different
 
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.809 align:start position:0%
issuing the letters to the different
entities

01:02:40.809 --> 01:02:40.819 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
informing them of what the violations
 
01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
are and requesting that they correct
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
those violations
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
if you perhaps see one of these letters
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
at some point you're going to see a
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
paragraph in it that notes that we might
 
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
be wrong and the reason we might be
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
wrong is because the campaign filing
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
system has challenges so we believe that
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
we are correct it has taken an
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
incredibly long time for us to go
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
through all of these documents to try to
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
make sure we're correct but don't be
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
surprised if we are not correct and you
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
hear complaints about that
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying to head those off of the
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
past but you are the most likely place
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
to hear about them
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
if we're incorrect we also are working
 
01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:27.980 align:start position:0%
on the 2022 filings
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
those seem to not have quite as many
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
challenges on in the campaign filing
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
system so we're hopeful about that
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
every six months we issue a biennial
 
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
report on the election matters that we
 
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
have closed out during that time period
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
and the statistical information on the
 
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
number that we've taken in we have been
 
01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
behind in those reports in the last few
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
years we have now caught up and we have
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
to the two reports on their way out for
 
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
to the two reports on their way out for
2022

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
um and that's a very helpful area for
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
all of you it specifically comes to the
 
01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
House and Senate election committees and
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of those reports is to
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
provide you with information and those
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
closeout letters and you can see a lot
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
of what we do on a day-to-day basis in
 
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
our office
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
we have an election line hotline that
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
hotline runs
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
every day all year long and then we have
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
an election hotline that goes on place
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
just for specific elections so for the
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
general election unit hotline I'll call
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
it in 2021 we logged 453 hotline calls
 
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
and we opened 60 of those as separate
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
matters that means that they needed to
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
be investigated or they needed to be
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
reviewed and letters needed to be issued
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
in order to deal with what
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
to to deal with what the issue was that
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
was complained about
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
in 2022 which was obviously and a a
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
general election year we logged 1085
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
hotline calls and 65 matters were open
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
so not necessarily many more matters but
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
many many more calls
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
in 2022 for the September primary the
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
election unit handled 158 different
 
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
inquiries and calls those are from
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
members of the public candidates
 
01:05:31.089 --> 01:05:31.099 align:start position:0%
political parties local election
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
officials and sometimes different state
 
01:05:34.559 --> 01:05:35.630 align:start position:0%
officials and sometimes different state
officials

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
officials
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
the November for the general election we
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
handled 275 inquiries again from those
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
different types of groups
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
we do criminal prosecutions as I
 
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned the um our two other attorneys
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
are currently in court right now dealing
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
with one of those we brought four
 
01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:57.500 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecutions during
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
2021-2022 and we had other ones that
 
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
were outstanding so we have resolved six
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
prosecutions in the last year and a half
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
we also have civil litigation matters
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
some of these are brought against us or
 
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
against the Secretary of State and some
 
01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
of them are brought by us so in 2021 to
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
2022 we had six different litigation
 
01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
matters those tend to be what we call
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
systems cases so their challenges to how
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
voter registration occurs their
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
challenges to as Secretary of State
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
state Scanlon mentioned voters who have
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
site impairment
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
and requested a different format to be
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
able to vote they we have been sued in
 
01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:48.740 align:start position:0%
the past for the
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
signatures on absentee ballots and their
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
envelopes and whether or not we could do
 
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
signature checks to see whether people
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
had accurately signed their names so
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
those types of cases are the bigger
 
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
cases we also have a couple of
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
redistricting cases that were brought
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
some have been resolved there's a couple
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
that are still outstanding
 
01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:12.059 align:start position:0%
we too sometimes are involved in
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
bringing cases so we brought cases
 
01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:18.299 align:start position:0%
against the City of Laconia the town of
 
01:07:18.299 --> 01:07:19.490 align:start position:0%
against the City of Laconia the town of
Bedford

01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
Bedford
 
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
and those two cases had to do with the
 
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:27.299 align:start position:0%
fact that we were trying to determine
 
01:07:29.289 --> 01:07:29.299 align:start position:0%
um whether ballots that had been found
 
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
in one case in the City of Laconia there
 
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
were ballots that were found inside a
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
ballot counting device that had not been
 
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
counted from previous elections and in
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
the town of Bedford Bedford had found
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
he set a of ballots in 2020 that had not
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
been counted absentee ballots and so in
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
order for us to open the ballot boxes
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
other than for a recount we have to get
 
01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
a court order so those two lawsuits
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
occurred in those matters we also sued
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
an individual who
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
um filed to become the county attorney
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
in Coos County and was not an attorney
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
so that was the first time we filed to
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
remove somebody from a ballot
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
and so those are the types of litigation
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
that we can be handling on a regular
 
01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.150 align:start position:0%
that we can be handling on a regular
basis

01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
and finally we have uh with respect to
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
I guess I I won't call it litigation but
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
it's activity that ended up coming here
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
into the legislature and was ordered for
 
01:08:35.809 --> 01:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
us to hold an audit which was different
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
than the audits that the secretary of
 
01:08:39.769 --> 01:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
state was talking about in the case that
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
we handled it was the window audit where
 
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
there were questions about the
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
difference between the election night
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
count of ballots and the recount of
 
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
those same ballots and so the
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
legislature required a an independent
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
set of Auditors to run an audit and so
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
in May of 2021 we spent three weeks
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
recounting in just about any possible
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
way you could imagine the ballots for
 
01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
the town of Windham
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
we work with the Secretary of State's
 
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
office in training all of the local
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
officials you'll see in the letters that
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
are attached to our by our biannual
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
reports that we will raise concerns with
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
election officials we have actually
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
asked some election officials to step
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
down from their positions including the
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
moderator of Laconia Ward 6 due to his
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
failure to make sure that ballots were
 
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
accurately counted thus disenfranchising
 
01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.110 align:start position:0%
accurately counted thus disenfranchising
voters

01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
and so in those cases we work very
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
closely to make sure the election
 
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
officials in those specific polling
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
places are trained but also the general
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
training for all election officials with
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
some of the major issues we saw around
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
the 2022 general election
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
and I'll just touch on these quickly our
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
public employees electioneering for the
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
matters that they're interested in we
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
have now issued a series of letters to
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
police departments and to mostly public
 
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
emergency response personnel as to who
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
is allowed to electioneer on a certain
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
issue that's involved in their community
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
and the fact that no matter who it is
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
who gets to a electioneer none of them
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
get to use public resources to do that
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
we also had some challenges in the 2022
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
general election with polling place
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
access some of those were seen on
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
television some of them were seen on
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
social media where we had polling place
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
access roads that became blocked because
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
of too much traffic and not enough
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
parking spaces generally that was the
 
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
combination that was very challenging
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
and we have some places where
 
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
the polling places just don't have
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
enough parking so we are working with
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
those communities to correct that prior
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
to the presidential
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
Primary in 2024.
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
we also have had many challenges to the
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices those have been
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
ongoing and we continue to work on those
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
and we have had numerous domicile
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
complaints which some of those have been
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
raised with us
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
by private entities who have done their
 
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
own research and many of those we also
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
investigate on our own because they're
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention by local
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
election officials who may find that
 
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
someone is has filed for office or has
 
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
voted in their community and doesn't
 
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
appear to actually live in their
 
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:42.830 align:start position:0%
appear to actually live in their
community

01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
so those are the types of issues that we
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
handle we are available to come over and
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions last year we worked
 
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
with this committee and with the senate
 
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.610 align:start position:0%
with this committee and with the senate
committee

01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
on a piece of legislation that gave us
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
more authority to issue civil penalties
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of authority to charge
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
people with crimes including
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors we're not charging somebody
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
who has mistakes on their campaign
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
filing forms with misdemeanors it's just
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
not the right approach to take so we
 
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
have requested permission to find people
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
and even those fines can won't and can't
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
happen on the first violation but it's
 
01:12:22.689 --> 01:12:22.699 align:start position:0%
more helpful to have finding Authority
 
01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
particularly in the area of signs one
 
01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:27.980 align:start position:0%
other area that we saw
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
rise during 2022 was the theft of signs
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
and we have at least one case in The
 
01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
Lakes region where a candidate has
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
reported that more than a hundred of her
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
signs were stolen so we're working
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
through that that's part of a criminal
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
investigation at this point but we we
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
work very closely with all of those and
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate the finding and civil
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
penalty Authority so I'd be happy to
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you for
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
letting me speak
 
01:12:58.689 --> 01:12:58.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'm glad you did
 
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
would you mind selling us who the
 
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
investigator is yes the investigator is
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
Dick Tracy
 
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
yes that's really Dick's name and
 
01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
nicknamed his son that too one of his
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
sons so but dick is it dick is a former
 
01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
captain from the Manchester police at
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
Manchester yes from Manchester police
 
01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
department and he's been with our office
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
for I think at least 15 years dick is
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
excellent at what he does
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
and I am so sad that there are now
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
people young enough to not know how
 
01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you Mr
 
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.590 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you Mr
chairman

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming uh you mentioned
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
something about a Laconia official uh
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
and you sent a letter asking them to
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
step down yeah so did I hear that
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
correctly okay did they and what is the
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
criteria that is used to send such a
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
letter that you make a determination
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
that you will send such a letter so the
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
official in Laconia was the moderator in
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
ward 6 and during the 2020 election
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
cycle more than 179 ballots were not
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
counted and so the criteria in that
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
position we didn't have the authority to
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
automatically remove that election
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
official but we believed that the loss
 
01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:28.820 align:start position:0%
of voting for 179 individuals in ward 6
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
was a significant dereliction of the
 
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that the moderator had
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
sworn to undertake and so we requested
 
01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm at 1600 violations from the 2020
 
01:14:53.699 --> 01:14:55.610 align:start position:0%
um I'm at 1600 violations from the 2020
campaign

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:01.430 align:start position:0%
campaign
um

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
reports are still outstanding we're
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
expected like something having been due
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
September 30th 2020 and returned in
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
October 1st 2020. yes it's the it's the
 
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
latter so they have they were well
 
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
actually I say that I shouldn't say that
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
because for all 1600 I can't answer that
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
question but in in the case of some of
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
those individuals it may be that they
 
01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
were supposed to have reported on
 
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
September 1st and they didn't report
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
until October 1st that while that might
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
not seem serious it is serious during an
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
election because it during that time
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
period if it was due on September 1st
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
the state primary occurred and so voters
 
01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
do not have the information as to who
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
may have given contributions or what
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures may have been made by that
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
campaign during that time period so it
 
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
may be that it's corrected at this point
 
01:16:03.169 --> 01:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
but we are going to note in those
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
letters that there is a violation that
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
occurred on the other hand there may
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
very well be circumstances where
 
01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
individual individuals didn't ever file
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
and so they were late in that but they
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
then didn't file and perhaps they didn't
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
win their election and maybe never
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
became a candidate again so they've got
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
a late filing there and they don't have
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
try and try your microphone again
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
all right so for these violations uh for
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who may have lost their
 
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
campaigns or hypothetically uh served
 
01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:57.260 align:start position:0%
for a number of years uh I I know that
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
there were uh rules on the books that
 
01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
said that you could not that you didn't
 
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
need to file if you hadn't spent over a
 
01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
um are you are you looking at those uh
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
so we review all of the statutes in all
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
of the filing requirements so if there
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
are individuals who didn't
 
01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.250 align:start position:0%
are individuals who didn't
it

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
the only I guess I'm trying to think of
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
exactly how to answer this because it
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
all depends on WE somebody doesn't come
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
to our attention as having to file a
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
report and told they either file a
 
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
report because they've
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
collected or or expended 500
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
or because somebody usually an opponent
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
of theirs reaches out to us and says
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
they've collected five hundred dollars
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
they had a fundraiser and they haven't
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
reported to you so other than that we
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't go out and try to determine
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
individuals so with respect to whether
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
somebody had to file a report once
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're in the reporting system there are
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
certain reports that have to be filed
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
including the report that needs to be
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
filed six months after the election if
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
you have any more funds and so if
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
somebody hasn't filed that report then
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
and now we know what makes the mics
 
01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.910 align:start position:0%
and now we know what makes the mics
Crackle

01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
Crackle
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you'll be working
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
with communities to resolve challenges
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
at polling locations
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
um mostly traffic congestion or lack of
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
parking how do you identify those
 
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
communities is that a complaint or are
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
you saying that communities need to have
 
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
a certain number of parking spaces to be
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
a polling location is that something
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
that you're evaluating all communities
 
01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.450 align:start position:0%
that you're evaluating all communities
or

01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:52.669 align:start position:0%
or
noise

01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
noise
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
so we it's usually as a result of a
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
complaint and it's usually a complaint
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
on Election Day and it's multiple
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
complaints so in the communities that
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
we're talking about these are
 
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
communities that absolutely struggled
 
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
for Access and during what so that you
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
all know what happens during election
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
day is one of the things that we do
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
there are a group of about five
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
attorneys in our office who have done
 
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
election work over the years who stay
 
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
and manage the hotline that comes into
 
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
our office so when problems like that
 
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
come up and I won't name any communities
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
because it's unfair to them
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
at this point but we spend a lot of time
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
on telephones the telephone with Chiefs
 
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
of police in particular so it's usually
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
the chief and the moderator who we have
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
on the phone trying to figure out what
 
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
it is that can be done to break the Log
 
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
Jam that's happening so that voters can
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
get in there and we come up with all
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
sorts of ideas and they come up with all
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
sorts of ideas and we work as well as we
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
can to solve the problem on Election Day
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you that we have never in
 
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
all the years that I've done this and on
 
01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
all the years we've had problems like
 
01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
this never have we had a community that
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
just sort of sat back after the election
 
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
and waited for us to show up they're
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
already working on it they know they
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
have a problem and it's their voters and
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
their residents and they don't want to
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
have that problem either but sometimes
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
it just takes all of us to sort of push
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
thing but yes you're up thanks
 
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
um is it your office that does the voter
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
affidavit paperwork
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
say that somebody comes in without their
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
license we take their picture
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
and then they sign off on an affidavit
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
is that your office that does that
 
01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.270 align:start position:0%
is that your office that does that
follow-ups

01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
follow-ups
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
so first it's the Secretary of State's
 
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
office that does the follow-up on that
 
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State's office
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
using different resources it has
 
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
available we'll try to determine whether
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
the individual who is signed an
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
affidavit because they didn't have some
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
piece of information to be able to prove
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
they were qualified as a voter or to
 
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
prove who they were the Secretary of
 
01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
State's office will do the first run at
 
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
those and see whether or not they can
 
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
identify all of those individuals when
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
they come to the end of their resources
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
then they come to us and at that point
 
01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:35.060 align:start position:0%
we can use law enforcement information
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
to be able to do additional searches
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
though I'll tell you back to Dick Tracy
 
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
most of the time he finds people on
 
01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
Facebook or social media of some type
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
that is the way that we can identify
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly somebody and where they
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
live or where they lived during that
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.930 --> 01:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:02.219 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much that was
 
01:22:02.219 --> 01:22:06.950 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much that was
great

01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
so we've run through our program what's
 
01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:15.140 align:start position:0%
going to happen this afternoon it's yes
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm Patty Lovejoy senior deputy
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
um one issue that is new this year that
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be happening next month
 
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are new on the
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
um in the last election a provision for
 
01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots
 
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
um was passed and this special election
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
will be the first time that provisional
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
ballot is in place so it's it's an issue
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
you may want to
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
um follow over the next month to see how
 
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
that process worked in this special
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
election plus they will
 
01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
um be in place for the March elections
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
so this is something that's completely
 
01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
new for the State of New Hampshire and I
 
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
just wanted to put it on your radar that
 
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
it will be in place for this special
 
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:25.130 align:start position:0%
it will be in place for this special
election

01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:27.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
as it was mentioned people in the past
 
01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
have followed have filed an affidavit do
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
you show up at the polls without your ID
 
01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
you fill out a challenge voter
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
um affidavit you attest that you are who
 
01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
you are and they take a picture we later
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
then send something to make sure that
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
that you are what's happening now with
 
01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
the provisional ballots and I said this
 
01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
was passed in the last legislature
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
and it takes place starting in 2023
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
now you will be given a packet
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
that you have to return to the Secretary
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
of State's office within a given number
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
of days that provides the information
 
01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
that you didn't have on Election Day if
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
you do not provide it
 
01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:20.990 align:start position:0%
you do not provide it
then

01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:24.980 align:start position:0%
we will notify you know what your town
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
that so and so did not provide that
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
information then the moderator will go
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
and retrieve your ballot
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
and remove the whoever you voted for
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
from the final tallies
 
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh and you're saying well how do they
 
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
know my ballot versus somebody else's uh
 
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
you will have a numbered affidavit
 
01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
ballot so
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
when you vote you don't have the
 
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
information the moderator is going to
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
record on your ballot this is affidavit
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
ballot number one and they're going to
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
keep track of that so they will notify
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
they will send that list to the
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
 
01:25:13.130 --> 01:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
as we get all of that information in and
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
we have to provide these envelopes with
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
which the post office no longer
 
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
guarantees overnight but that's another
 
01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:24.290 align:start position:0%
guarantees overnight but that's another
issue

01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
um but if we don't receive them
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
by a certain date
 
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
we will then notify the town
 
01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
that affidavit ballot number three and
 
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
number eight did not Retreat did not
 
01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:40.490 align:start position:0%
number eight did not Retreat did not
return

01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
their information in time
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
and then the moderator will pull ballot
 
01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
number I don't remember what numbers I
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
said if it was two and eight we'll we'll
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
pull ballots two and eight and whoever
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
they voted for or whatever worn article
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
Etc that they voted for their votes will
 
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
be removed before the final vote is so
 
01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
this is the first time
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire history that we are
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to have provisional ballots
 
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
um obviously this bill came through this
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee and it was worked quite a bit
 
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
between this committee and um
 
01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
and senate elections so I just wanted to
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure that secretary
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
he just didn't think about bringing
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
bring it up but it is something that's
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's coming up and you may want to pay
 
01:26:39.169 --> 01:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
attention to how easily or how difficult
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.330 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.610 --> 01:27:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
there are absentee ballots as there are
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
in any election they are doing it during
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
the vacation week and they're
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
specifically doing it during the
 
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
vacation week so that they can use the
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
um the school
 
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
gymnasium as they have as they have done
 
01:27:31.729 --> 01:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to have for this
 
01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
special election a special place to to
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
vote they didn't want to confuse any of
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
the voters but as in any election there
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
are absentee ballots available the you
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
will cover ballots will be going out to
 
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
any um any voters who uh you know have
 
01:27:59.530 --> 01:27:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.159 --> 01:28:06.790 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
regards to the
 
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:17.149 align:start position:0%
regards to the
um

01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
They will receive a packet right when
 
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
they register so they come in to vote
 
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
they don't have their ID
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
they will normally you get you get your
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
your picture taken it's put onto the
 
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
challenge voter affidavit at that moment
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
the voter will receive this packet from
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office that has
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
the overnight
 
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
um mailing envelope and specifically
 
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
what it is that they need to provide if
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
they go on vacation
 
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
and they don't take care of this
 
01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.870 align:start position:0%
and they don't take care of this
beforehand

01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
beforehand
 
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
their ballot is not going their their
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
ballot will um be pulled because they
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
won't have gotten the information to the
 
01:29:03.169 --> 01:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office in time so
 
01:29:06.649 --> 01:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
if you voted and you had a challenge uh
 
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
voter the the best
 
01:29:12.729 --> 01:29:12.739 align:start position:0%
the best practice is to be go home
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
complete the information get it sent off
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State but if you
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
wait till you at the end of the vacation
 
01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
your your affidav your ballot will have
 
01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:23.570 align:start position:0%
your your affidav your ballot will have
been

01:29:23.570 --> 01:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
for the provisional ballots will
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
the metrics or the metadata on the the
 
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
number of provisional ballots in a given
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
election be reported to you know in the
 
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
same way that undervotes and
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
over votes are now uh being reported is
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
there some provision for the reporting
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
of that statistic
 
01:29:58.850 --> 01:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
the the bill did not have Provisions I
 
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
mean obviously it's any information
 
01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
um to do with elections is public
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
information so if somebody requests and
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this committee will
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
somebody on this committee I'm sure will
 
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
um ask how many provisional ballots
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
there were and how many were satisfied
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
that information will be
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
so assume I mean this election obviously
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
was a tied election so the chances that
 
01:30:58.970 --> 01:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
this one might be close are are probably
 
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
pretty good
 
01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
um if you know if on Election night it's
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
off by you know somebody wins by two and
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
there are eight
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
um provisional ballots the we will not
 
01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.110 align:start position:0%
um provisional ballots the we will not
certify

01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
certify
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
the winner until after the provisional
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
ballot time frame has gone by
 
01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:23.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.970 --> 01:35:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.890 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:18.470 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:48.669 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:37:48.669 --> 01:37:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:53.000 align:start position:0%

the thing is it could be
the same

02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:57.070 --> 02:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's just uh oh it was the freezing on
 
03:09:01.210 --> 03:09:01.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:04.190 --> 03:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
all right I apologize to everyone for us
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%

hearing on House Bill 101 welcome
 
03:09:25.370 --> 03:09:25.380 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr thank you Mr chair happy to
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%

so uh we'll get right to this uh I I'd
 
03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
like everyone to cast their minds back
 
03:09:39.889 --> 03:09:39.899 align:start position:0%
to 1996 to start and I and I have sent
 
03:09:41.929 --> 03:09:41.939 align:start position:0%
electronic uh copies of this
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
correspondence to the committee
 
03:09:45.530 --> 03:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
so any of any of you who weren't around
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
in 1996
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
um will will hopefully trust my history
 
03:09:54.110 --> 03:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
here so uh GOP Governor Steve merrow uh
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
opted not to run for re-election as some
 
03:09:58.730 --> 03:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
of you will call them so that opened up
 
03:10:02.090 --> 03:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
a it created an opening for governor uh
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
state senator Gene Shaheen immediately
 
03:10:07.130 --> 03:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
declared her candidacy and she ran on a
 
03:10:09.170 --> 03:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
post and the Democrat Democratic primary
 
03:10:11.570 --> 03:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
now on the Republican side uh
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
Congressman Bill zelloff the late Bill
 
03:10:16.490 --> 03:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
zealth declared a gubernatorial
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
candidacy and he was the strong favorite
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh overwhelming favorite
 
03:10:24.290 --> 03:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh now conservative activist Ovid
 
03:10:27.769 --> 03:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
LaMontagne who who I like uh also ran a
 
03:10:30.769 --> 03:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
very long shot campaign for the GOP
 
03:10:32.690 --> 03:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
nomination if you gave him any any
 
03:10:35.809 --> 03:10:35.819 align:start position:0%
chance but On That September 10th of
 
03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
1996 uh LaMontagne stunned Zelf edging
 
03:10:46.010 --> 03:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
him out with 47 556 votes two forty
 
03:10:47.690 --> 03:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
three thousand three ninety three and
 
03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
you can look it up
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh uh State Senator Shaheen received
 
03:10:56.090 --> 03:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
only 52 328 votes and getting the
 
03:10:59.210 --> 03:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
Democratic nomination but that November
 
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
Shaheen trounced uh LaMontagne to become
 
03:11:05.870 --> 03:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
governor uh she'd go on to become the
 
03:11:07.969 --> 03:11:07.979 align:start position:0%
first woman to serve as both governor
 
03:11:11.570 --> 03:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
and senator uh very historic and very
 
03:11:13.370 --> 03:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
consequential for our state and indeed
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
for our country what happened in 1996 so
 
03:11:18.110 --> 03:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
what happened in 1996
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
the Republican primary gubernatorial
 
03:11:24.050 --> 03:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
vote was almost double that of the
 
03:11:26.630 --> 03:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
Democrat Democratic vote and yet Shaheen
 
03:11:28.130 --> 03:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
trounce LaMontagne in the general
 
03:11:30.650 --> 03:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
election now interestingly even though
 
03:11:33.650 --> 03:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
she received only uh 52 000 votes in the
 
03:11:37.849 --> 03:11:37.859 align:start position:0%
primary she received two 284
 
03:11:40.010 --> 03:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
000 votes in the general election
 
03:11:42.410 --> 03:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
so what happens seems to involve a
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
concerted effort on the part of some
 
03:11:47.630 --> 03:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
folks from from one party to declare his
 
03:11:50.570 --> 03:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
independence or unaffiliated and and
 
03:11:53.389 --> 03:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
frankly to control the outcome of the
 
03:11:56.330 --> 03:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
other party's primary uh the the popular
 
03:11:56.340 --> 03:11:57.830 align:start position:0%
other party's primary uh the the popular
zealth

03:11:57.830 --> 03:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
zealth
 
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
had experience and name recognition and
 
03:12:02.330 --> 03:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
probably it was seen as near unbeatable
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
in a general election
 
03:12:06.650 --> 03:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
and despite passionate conservative
 
03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
conservative support LaMontagne had
 
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
limited experience and could be
 
03:12:14.929 --> 03:12:14.939 align:start position:0%
portrayed by some as an idea ideologue
 
03:12:18.230 --> 03:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh as I said in a let go of it
 
03:12:20.690 --> 03:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
so so the other party seems to have gone
 
03:12:23.929 --> 03:12:23.939 align:start position:0%
all in for LaMontagne over zealth in
 
03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
that September 1996 GOP Primary and and
 
03:12:29.570 --> 03:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
this is going to take on a partisan
 
03:12:33.469 --> 03:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
flavor and and I I feel a little bad
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
about that uh I have a lot of great
 
03:12:37.309 --> 03:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
friends in the other party family
 
03:12:37.319 --> 03:12:38.410 align:start position:0%
friends in the other party family
members

03:12:38.410 --> 03:12:38.420 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:12:41.090 --> 03:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors but it is what it is and I
 
03:12:42.769 --> 03:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
just feel I need to say these things
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
because they need to be said
 
03:12:45.359 --> 03:12:47.269 align:start position:0%
because they need to be said
so

03:12:47.269 --> 03:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:47.279 --> 03:12:49.309 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:12:49.309 --> 03:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
there were folks as a as I've said
 
03:12:55.010 --> 03:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
before who seem to clearly have uh
 
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
signed on to vote in the GOP Primary who
 
03:13:00.110 --> 03:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
obviously were not Republicans and and
 
03:13:03.290 --> 03:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
really did not want Zelf to be the the
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
nominee so how do we know this well Sun
 
03:13:07.969 --> 03:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
admitted it one told me directly and the
 
03:13:10.490 --> 03:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
numbers bear this out Shaheen's primary
 
03:13:12.349 --> 03:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
vote total was only slightly ahead of
 
03:13:14.990 --> 03:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
that of both zealots and lamontagues and
 
03:13:17.870 --> 03:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
I read to the numbers uh zof LaMontagne
 
03:13:19.490 --> 03:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
combined for almost a hundred thousand
 
03:13:19.500 --> 03:13:20.630 align:start position:0%
combined for almost a hundred thousand
votes

03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
votes
 
03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
to Shaheen's 52 000 as erstwhile
 
03:13:26.210 --> 03:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
Independence Undeclared or unaffiliated
 
03:13:29.450 --> 03:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
voted for LaMontagne so why does this
 
03:13:33.170 --> 03:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
matter today well fast forward to 2022.
 
03:13:34.969 --> 03:13:34.979 align:start position:0%
just a few months ago
 
03:13:37.370 --> 03:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
one party apparently again made a
 
03:13:40.250 --> 03:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
concerted effort to intrude on the other
 
03:13:42.769 --> 03:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
party's primary and pick their preferred
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
opponents in several Federal Federal
 
03:13:47.690 --> 03:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
races in particular how do we know this
 
03:13:49.730 --> 03:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
well because again some folks admitted
 
03:13:52.210 --> 03:13:52.220 align:start position:0%
it and it's documented that one party
 
03:13:55.130 --> 03:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
literally spent millions of dollars to
 
03:13:57.170 --> 03:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
influence the other party's primary
 
03:14:00.170 --> 03:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
outcome was this legal maybe maybe not
 
03:14:03.130 --> 03:14:03.140 align:start position:0%
not technically was it unethical maybe
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
and actually some of the shenanigans
 
03:14:08.750 --> 03:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
were illegal
 
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
according to published reports for
 
03:14:14.210 --> 03:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
illegal political mailers were sent to
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
the second CD District
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
which were identified by state legis
 
03:14:22.910 --> 03:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
State investigators but but both the
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
mailing company
 
03:14:26.570 --> 03:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
that sent the mailers in this
 
03:14:28.610 --> 03:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
politically connected Law Firm refused
 
03:14:31.370 --> 03:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
to identify the customer according to
 
03:14:33.230 --> 03:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Attorney General
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
so Reynolds DeWalt and this is a public
 
03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
record a direct mail Printing Company
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
New Bedford Massachusetts admitted to
 
03:14:43.429 --> 03:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
sending the mailers but initially
 
03:14:46.070 --> 03:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
refused to say who paid for them
 
03:14:48.290 --> 03:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
so here are some fresh numbers
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
from just last September in the second
 
03:14:56.050 --> 03:14:56.060 align:start position:0%
CD primary GOP candidates received 63
 
03:14:59.090 --> 03:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
868 votes
 
03:15:03.769 --> 03:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
any Custer received only 48 630 votes
 
03:15:08.090 --> 03:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
and yet like like Shaheen in 1996 Custer
 
03:15:10.910 --> 03:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
rolled to an overwhelming general
 
03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
election Victory it is what it is it was
 
03:15:15.769 --> 03:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
what it was so it seems apparent that
 
03:15:18.290 --> 03:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
many again non-republicans voting in
 
03:15:20.450 --> 03:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
Republican primaries are selecting
 
03:15:22.670 --> 03:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
candidates that most Republicans don't
 
03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:23.690 align:start position:0%
candidates that most Republicans don't
want

03:15:23.690 --> 03:15:23.700 align:start position:0%
want
 
03:15:26.090 --> 03:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's uh some see it is unethical some
 
03:15:29.469 --> 03:15:29.479 align:start position:0%
see it as scandalous now who says so
 
03:15:32.090 --> 03:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
Democrats with Integrity who are
 
03:15:35.210 --> 03:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
embarrassed in the policy so 34
 
03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
prominent National Democrats of
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
Integrity signed an open letter
 
03:15:43.490 --> 03:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
decrying the shenanigans the the
 
03:15:43.500 --> 03:15:44.750 align:start position:0%
decrying the shenanigans the the
mischief

03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
mischief
 
03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
one of the signatories was New Hampshire
 
03:15:48.950 --> 03:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
Democrat dick sweat of BOE a former
 
03:15:52.730 --> 03:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
Congressman former Ambassador so to
 
03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
close this out I'm going to read in part
 
03:15:57.050 --> 03:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
03:16:01.010 --> 03:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
Congressman sweat signed on to quote
 
03:16:03.469 --> 03:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
as members of the democratic party we
 
03:16:06.170 --> 03:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
are dismayed by the recent practices of
 
03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
democratic organizations intervening in
 
03:16:10.429 --> 03:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
Republican primaries to promote
 
03:16:13.730 --> 03:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
candidates these destructive primary
 
03:16:16.130 --> 03:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
tactics aim to elevate Republican
 
03:16:18.530 --> 03:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
candidates who Democrats hope they can
 
03:16:21.230 --> 03:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
more easily beat in November but it is
 
03:16:23.570 --> 03:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
risky and unethical to promote such
 
03:16:25.849 --> 03:16:25.859 align:start position:0%
candidates we must stop this practice
 
03:16:30.050 --> 03:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
and stop today unquote that from
 
03:16:33.170 --> 03:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
Congressman sweat thank you Ambassador
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
sweat so New Hampshire's primary
 
03:16:38.929 --> 03:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
elections are are seen by many is to be
 
03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
compromised many of us think it's wrong
 
03:16:42.110 --> 03:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
many of us think it's unethical many
 
03:16:45.290 --> 03:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
many of us think it's it's scandalous it
 
03:16:48.769 --> 03:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
creates cynicism it's some of us think
 
03:16:50.809 --> 03:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
it is a blight on our electoral
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
processes and an embarrassment to our
 
03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:54.170 align:start position:0%
processes and an embarrassment to our
state

03:16:54.170 --> 03:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
but many folks wink and Nod and Snicker
 
03:17:00.309 --> 03:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
at the at the mischief
 
03:17:04.510 --> 03:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
hbo1 excuse me HB 101 would fix this
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
Democratic primaries would be for
 
03:17:09.230 --> 03:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
Democrats Republican primaries would be
 
03:17:12.530 --> 03:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
for Republicans imagine that
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
and yes we know the arguments against
 
03:17:16.969 --> 03:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
closed primaries and yes we know about
 
03:17:18.830 --> 03:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
40 percent of our electorate our
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
independence erstwhile Independence
 
03:17:24.110 --> 03:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
but but c'est la vie
 
03:17:26.330 --> 03:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh so I know the spill as you have it
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
may need to fine-tuning with dates I
 
03:17:29.570 --> 03:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
know you have other bills that you're
 
03:17:31.309 --> 03:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
going to be taking up on moving the
 
03:17:33.410 --> 03:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
primary dates uh that may or may not
 
03:17:36.110 --> 03:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
happen that is really going to be
 
03:17:37.790 --> 03:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
determined in this committee
 
03:17:41.630 --> 03:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
so uh because the committee will own
 
03:17:44.150 --> 03:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
these bills you obviously can amend this
 
03:17:46.370 --> 03:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
one or other ones that will and finally
 
03:17:50.090 --> 03:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
there is a wonderful 1939 movie I know
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
many of you have seen it 1939 called Mr
 
03:17:54.590 --> 03:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
Smith Goes to Washington
 
03:17:57.530 --> 03:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
Jimmy Stewart played a guy named
 
03:18:00.490 --> 03:18:00.500 align:start position:0%
Jefferson Smith a man who was appointed
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
to uh to be a senator from
 
03:18:08.090 --> 03:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
from a western state you know it's the
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
the movie's Loosely based on an actual
 
03:18:13.490 --> 03:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
senator in the 1920s who was who went to
 
03:18:14.929 --> 03:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
Washington from Montana and was
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
horrified by the shenanigans and the
 
03:18:19.190 --> 03:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
Mischief going on and what some now call
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
the swamp but in the movie Jefferson
 
03:18:25.010 --> 03:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
Smith took on the uh these Corrupt
 
03:18:26.929 --> 03:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
Practices shined a light on them and
 
03:18:28.730 --> 03:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
made a difference
 
03:18:31.130 --> 03:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
this inspiring movie was nominated for
 
03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
11 Academy Awards so I just hope that we
 
03:18:36.230 --> 03:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
can find some New Hampshire versions of
 
03:18:39.889 --> 03:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
Mr Smith to address the uh the
 
03:18:41.809 --> 03:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
shenanigans that are happening in our
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
state so thank you Mr chair and I'd be
 
03:18:46.670 --> 03:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
03:18:48.410 --> 03:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
 
03:18:48.420 --> 03:18:51.170 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
committee

03:18:51.170 --> 03:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:51.180 --> 03:18:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:18:54.230 --> 03:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:57.290 --> 03:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question hello
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so I just need a clarification in
 
03:19:01.550 --> 03:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph three
 
03:19:05.570 --> 03:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
it says no basically says no Undeclared
 
03:19:05.580 --> 03:19:07.250 align:start position:0%
it says no basically says no Undeclared
person

03:19:07.250 --> 03:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:19:07.260 --> 03:19:08.630 align:start position:0%
person
uh

03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
shall affiliate with the party within
 
03:19:13.010 --> 03:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
four months of the state primary
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
election so does that mean
 
03:19:19.490 --> 03:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
you have to uh register if you want to
 
03:19:22.730 --> 03:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
vote for a party in the primary you have
 
03:19:25.969 --> 03:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
to register for that party before four
 
03:19:27.950 --> 03:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
months sure yes thank you for the
 
03:19:30.050 --> 03:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
question it's a good question and yes
 
03:19:33.170 --> 03:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
there's a need obviously to if some
 
03:19:34.730 --> 03:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
measure such as this is to move forward
 
03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some timelines and
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
some deadlines and so those are the
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
deadlines that we that we put in as is
 
03:19:43.849 --> 03:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
there necessary and as I said before if
 
03:19:45.769 --> 03:19:45.779 align:start position:0%
this were to be and I know this will go
 
03:19:47.690 --> 03:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
to exact session and I don't know what
 
03:19:49.429 --> 03:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
will happen with it but you certainly
 
03:19:51.889 --> 03:19:51.899 align:start position:0%
can uh look at the at these deadlines
 
03:19:53.210 --> 03:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
and timelines
 
03:19:53.220 --> 03:19:53.870 align:start position:0%
and timelines
um

03:19:53.870 --> 03:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
um and I think it would be healthy to
 
03:19:58.670 --> 03:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
look at those as I said before if the
 
03:20:01.010 --> 03:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
other measures that seek to change the
 
03:20:03.889 --> 03:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
primary date if this committee uh
 
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
recommends any of those then then these
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
deadlines and timelines certainly could
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
be uh you know we thought or adjusted
 
03:20:15.410 --> 03:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay and follow-up question follow up
 
03:20:17.929 --> 03:20:17.939 align:start position:0%
um so so then the next sentence means
 
03:20:20.690 --> 03:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
that if a person is is registered with
 
03:20:24.769 --> 03:20:24.779 align:start position:0%
the party they can't change their party
 
03:20:24.779 --> 03:20:25.610 align:start position:0%
the party they can't change their party
um

03:20:25.610 --> 03:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:29.170 --> 03:20:29.180 align:start position:0%
until before the first Wednesday in June
 
03:20:31.969 --> 03:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and that's correct again
 
03:20:33.889 --> 03:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some
 
03:20:36.349 --> 03:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
um definition and timelines again
 
03:20:40.190 --> 03:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
deadline so uh that is the the intent of
 
03:20:42.410 --> 03:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
the first Wednesday in June and the day
 
03:20:44.450 --> 03:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
before the state primary election is to
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
provide that definition in those those
 
03:20:49.010 --> 03:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
deadlines or timelines but certainly uh
 
03:20:50.570 --> 03:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
you all could
 
03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
could could change if if you if you
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to okay okay thank you very much
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:02.929 --> 03:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
 
03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative taking my
 
03:21:04.439 --> 03:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative taking my
question

03:21:05.750 --> 03:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
um you've uh compared in in the gubernet
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
trial race in 1996 and I think the
 
03:21:14.290 --> 03:21:14.300 align:start position:0%
second congressional district race 2022
 
03:21:16.250 --> 03:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
the primary vote with the general
 
03:21:19.610 --> 03:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
election vote for governor former
 
03:21:22.010 --> 03:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
Governor Shaheen and congresswoman
 
03:21:22.020 --> 03:21:23.630 align:start position:0%
Governor Shaheen and congresswoman
Custer

03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
Custer
 
03:21:23.640 --> 03:21:25.250 align:start position:0%
Custer
um

03:21:25.250 --> 03:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:27.769 --> 03:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
what fraction let's just look at the
 
03:21:30.290 --> 03:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
Custer race from 2022 what fraction of
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
Representative Custer's general election
 
03:21:36.590 --> 03:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
vote do you would you expect to see
 
03:21:38.750 --> 03:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
um show up and vote for her in the
 
03:21:40.730 --> 03:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
uncontested primary
 
03:21:43.490 --> 03:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
that that's a great question
 
03:21:46.309 --> 03:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and I've thought about that is as I
 
03:21:48.650 --> 03:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
looked at these numbers uh
 
03:21:52.370 --> 03:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
given the relatively small numbers of
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
votes that that both Custer or Shaheen
 
03:21:56.929 --> 03:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
got in the in the primaries that I
 
03:21:58.670 --> 03:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned and then the huge votes that
 
03:22:01.309 --> 03:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
they get in the general election so some
 
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
of that's to be expected and thank you
 
03:22:04.370 --> 03:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
for the question excellent question what
 
03:22:05.630 --> 03:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
I've already thought about
 
03:22:09.530 --> 03:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh there is obviously more
 
03:22:12.290 --> 03:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
participation in a general election uh I
 
03:22:14.450 --> 03:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
know Secretary of State's here he can
 
03:22:16.429 --> 03:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
speak to this much better than me but in
 
03:22:18.170 --> 03:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
terms of anticipated percentages that's
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
that goes to the to the nub of the
 
03:22:24.170 --> 03:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
concern here is that many of us given
 
03:22:26.809 --> 03:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
the huge numbers that the two candidates
 
03:22:28.330 --> 03:22:28.340 align:start position:0%
they mentioned received in the general
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
why were there
 
03:22:33.290 --> 03:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
um their primary Turtles comparatively
 
03:22:35.929 --> 03:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
so small uh
 
03:22:40.429 --> 03:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
and that is what led some of us to think
 
03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
that many people who uh supported either
 
03:22:47.929 --> 03:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
Senator state Senator Shaheen or uh
 
03:22:50.210 --> 03:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
congresswoman Custer
 
03:22:53.389 --> 03:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
um just didn't vote for her in the
 
03:22:55.790 --> 03:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
primaries they chose to vote and the
 
03:22:58.130 --> 03:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
other primary to influence that outcome
 
03:23:01.250 --> 03:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
so what percentage would I expect I
 
03:23:02.870 --> 03:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
would have expected frankly to answer
 
03:23:07.010 --> 03:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
the question that the percentage of
 
03:23:09.050 --> 03:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
voters for both those candidates would
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
have been much higher in the primary and
 
03:23:13.550 --> 03:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
why wasn't it that way that's the point
 
03:23:16.250 --> 03:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
of uh my earlier testimony does that
 
03:23:19.010 --> 03:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
answer your question at all or thank you
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.120 --> 03:23:31.370 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:23:31.370 --> 03:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:32.950 --> 03:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:23:36.050 --> 03:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
the way I understand this then if you
 
03:23:38.090 --> 03:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
moved into New Hampshire
 
03:23:40.849 --> 03:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
within the four months or whatever the
 
03:23:43.969 --> 03:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
whatever the period is you would not
 
03:23:46.370 --> 03:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
then be able to select
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
either party Democrats or Republicans
 
03:23:53.330 --> 03:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
if you move into the state New within
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
that time period
 
03:23:57.050 --> 03:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that's another great
 
03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
question and I'm so happy to see the
 
03:24:00.469 --> 03:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State here because it's
 
03:24:02.450 --> 03:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
something uh he may be able to speak to
 
03:24:06.889 --> 03:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
better than me because the again is to
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
the earlier question the necessary
 
03:24:11.650 --> 03:24:11.660 align:start position:0%
timelines and deadlines
 
03:24:14.570 --> 03:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
could conceivably preclude some folks
 
03:24:16.250 --> 03:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
from participating in the primary the
 
03:24:18.050 --> 03:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
same way that they do now
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
so I think the timelines and deadlines
 
03:24:22.250 --> 03:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
are essential and necessary great
 
03:24:23.929 --> 03:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
question because if somebody does move
 
03:24:23.939 --> 03:24:24.950 align:start position:0%
question because if somebody does move
in

03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:24:26.929 --> 03:24:26.939 align:start position:0%
um would they be precluded by this
 
03:24:28.729 --> 03:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
language from from registering to vote
 
03:24:31.429 --> 03:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
in a primary and uh that's something
 
03:24:35.330 --> 03:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
that I uh and those of us who care about
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
this you know talked about
 
03:24:40.990 --> 03:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
um but the purpose of a closed primary
 
03:24:45.229 --> 03:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
is to ensure the Integrity of the
 
03:24:48.170 --> 03:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
primary and that the people who vote in
 
03:24:51.229 --> 03:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
the primary are truly members of the
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
party now going way back
 
03:24:57.050 --> 03:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
um and I've been around for a while in
 
03:24:59.210 --> 03:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there used to be deadlines
 
03:25:02.450 --> 03:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
so you had to uh you know register to
 
03:25:04.490 --> 03:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
vote like 30 days or whatever different
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
times in our history and now we've come
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
to this model where we have same-day
 
03:25:11.510 --> 03:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
registration that is another issue but
 
03:25:13.309 --> 03:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh again thank you for the excellent
 
03:25:16.550 --> 03:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
question and um a
 
03:25:18.290 --> 03:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
look forward to the Secretary of State
 
03:25:20.269 --> 03:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
if he gets a chance to say anything to
 
03:25:21.950 --> 03:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
maybe touching on that does that help
 
03:25:23.769 --> 03:25:23.779 align:start position:0%
you at all
 
03:25:28.429 --> 03:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:31.309 --> 03:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
follow up uh well it's technically not a
 
03:25:33.170 --> 03:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up so if there's anybody else you
 
03:25:35.450 --> 03:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
can come back to me
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
um then I have a it's not a follow-up
 
03:25:46.210 --> 03:25:46.220 align:start position:0%
it's a new question the existing statute
 
03:25:50.450 --> 03:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
allows a party to only allow party
 
03:25:53.210 --> 03:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
members to vote in their primary
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
so my question is if this is something
 
03:25:58.309 --> 03:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the Republicans or the Democrats
 
03:26:01.010 --> 03:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to do don't they now have the
 
03:26:03.170 --> 03:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
mechanism to do that
 
03:26:04.910 --> 03:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question so you
 
03:26:06.769 --> 03:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
just stated that the existing statute
 
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
allow only allows
 
03:26:10.969 --> 03:26:10.979 align:start position:0%
party members to vote in primaries today
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:23.450 --> 03:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to look at that again
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
I don't want to give you an answer
 
03:26:28.130 --> 03:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
unless I'm exactly sure how I'm I'm
 
03:26:30.050 --> 03:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
praising it so
 
03:26:31.729 --> 03:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
um that's a piece of this I want to look
 
03:26:34.370 --> 03:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
at again in terms of party control over
 
03:26:34.380 --> 03:26:36.070 align:start position:0%
at again in terms of party control over
uh

03:26:36.070 --> 03:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:38.929 --> 03:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
uh you know registering or participating
 
03:26:41.210 --> 03:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
in a primary and for the third or fourth
 
03:26:43.130 --> 03:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
time I uh I'm so pleased that the
 
03:26:45.889 --> 03:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is here because I he
 
03:26:45.899 --> 03:26:46.969 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is here because I he
uh

03:26:46.969 --> 03:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:48.950 --> 03:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sure could could explain some of the
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
history or how that works better better
 
03:26:53.809 --> 03:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:55.070 --> 03:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
03:27:00.110 --> 03:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:03.170 --> 03:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
and now we begin the part where I mangle
 
03:27:05.210 --> 03:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
names I will do my best
 
03:27:12.170 --> 03:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:34.190 --> 03:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:36.349 --> 03:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
all right you gotta hit the button on
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
the right it'll light up red
 
03:27:41.030 --> 03:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
03:27:44.690 --> 03:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
all right my name is Charlotte Pogue I'm
 
03:27:48.769 --> 03:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
registered in I'm and as Undeclared in
 
03:27:51.370 --> 03:27:51.380 align:start position:0%
the town of Brookline
 
03:27:54.050 --> 03:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned there are more
 
03:27:56.090 --> 03:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
registered undeclareds than there are
 
03:27:58.429 --> 03:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
Republicans and more than there are
 
03:27:58.439 --> 03:28:00.410 align:start position:0%
Republicans and more than there are
Democrats

03:28:00.410 --> 03:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
Democrats
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes my understanding is
 
03:28:05.769 --> 03:28:05.779 align:start position:0%
that undeclares will be disenfranchised
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
for primaries at least unless they
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
re-register as Republican or Democrat
 
03:28:13.550 --> 03:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
four months before the election
 
03:28:15.889 --> 03:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
before many people have even made up
 
03:28:17.150 --> 03:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
their minds
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
and that's an imposition
 
03:28:22.130 --> 03:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see government of the People
 
03:28:24.769 --> 03:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
by the people and for the people instead
 
03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
of what we have now which is government
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
of the parties by the lobbyists and for
 
03:28:31.610 --> 03:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
the money
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
um my ideas for better elections how
 
03:28:37.190 --> 03:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
about open ballots even in the primaries
 
03:28:39.290 --> 03:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
put everybody on the ballot
 
03:28:42.290 --> 03:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh I can vote for a republican for
 
03:28:44.690 --> 03:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
governor and a Democrat for
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
um dog catcher and uh
 
03:28:53.570 --> 03:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
another idea which I really favor is
 
03:28:56.690 --> 03:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:56.700 --> 03:28:58.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:28:58.610 --> 03:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
and if we really want to get somewhere
 
03:29:03.530 --> 03:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
we could eliminate the parties because
 
03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
to me party Warfare is why government
 
03:29:09.050 --> 03:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
very often fails to govern for the
 
03:29:09.060 --> 03:29:10.969 align:start position:0%
very often fails to govern for the
people

03:29:10.969 --> 03:29:10.979 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:29:10.979 --> 03:29:13.010 align:start position:0%
people
um

03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
let's say just as an aside I volunteered
 
03:29:18.530 --> 03:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
to work for the election this year
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
because they needed people to check in
 
03:29:24.290 --> 03:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
and I was told that I couldn't do that
 
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
because I was Undeclared the rules are
 
03:29:30.290 --> 03:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
there must be an even number of people
 
03:29:33.530 --> 03:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
checking in voters and half of them must
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
be Republicans and half of them must be
 
03:29:39.469 --> 03:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
Democrats no one declared so I needed to
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
re-register just to volunteer to help
 
03:29:45.050 --> 03:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
with the with the recent election and
 
03:29:46.969 --> 03:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
then get myself back to Undeclared
 
03:29:49.550 --> 03:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
afterwards I don't know I just feel
 
03:29:52.610 --> 03:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
Undeclared are not getting the proper
 
03:29:52.620 --> 03:29:53.630 align:start position:0%
Undeclared are not getting the proper
respect

03:29:53.630 --> 03:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
respect
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to see this particular law
 
03:30:00.590 --> 03:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
not pass thank you very much
 
03:30:12.130 --> 03:30:12.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:14.830 --> 03:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
Stephen Bourne
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:28.250 --> 03:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm obviously Stephen Bourne for
 
03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
those of you who don't know me you'll be
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
seeing quite a bit of me this year
 
03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
throughout these hearings as I was at
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
quite a few last year
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
um I'll be speaking
 
03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
um against measures that are not in the
 
03:30:44.809 --> 03:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
best interest of the state and I'll be
 
03:30:48.530 --> 03:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
speaking four ones that do help us get
 
03:30:50.690 --> 03:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
more engaged and choose to spend more of
 
03:30:53.210 --> 03:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
our time to manage all the government we
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
buy every year whether that's you know
 
03:30:59.389 --> 03:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
local state county or federal
 
03:31:02.150 --> 03:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
um why well my hobby is to get our
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
client to get all of our citizens to
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
choose to spend a small fraction another
 
03:31:06.000 --> 03:31:07.190 align:start position:0%
choose to spend a small fraction another
time

03:31:07.190 --> 03:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
helping to better manage all the
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
government services we buy every year
 
03:31:13.610 --> 03:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
so for the past Dozen Years if you don't
 
03:31:15.410 --> 03:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
know I've been running our local Civic
 
03:31:18.050 --> 03:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
group where we put out a monthly email
 
03:31:19.969 --> 03:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
that says what went out of town what are
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
the key things from select board
 
03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
planning Etc the goal is to help people
 
03:31:27.530 --> 03:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
before more educated and more informed
 
03:31:30.530 --> 03:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
and hence participate more in in our
 
03:31:30.540 --> 03:31:31.309 align:start position:0%
and hence participate more in in our
government

03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:31:33.969 --> 03:31:33.979 align:start position:0%
so and also the national civic league
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
has got back to us and told us they
 
03:31:38.330 --> 03:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
haven't found anyone across the country
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
that does quite what we do as far as our
 
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
newsletter the citizens handbook guide
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
the analysis of budgets Etc I also
 
03:31:49.010 --> 03:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
published the New Hampshire common
 
03:31:51.650 --> 03:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
denominator newsletter so if you want to
 
03:31:52.729 --> 03:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
get involved in one of these
 
03:31:55.610 --> 03:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
non-partisan groups across the state how
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
do you do it who do you get involved
 
03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
with and so that's what the New
 
03:32:00.469 --> 03:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire common denominator newsletter
 
03:32:03.950 --> 03:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
does today is an against day
 
03:32:07.070 --> 03:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
okay you were elected to represent the
 
03:32:09.830 --> 03:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
people not a political party
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
um it was in sort of embarrassing this
 
03:32:13.550 --> 03:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
measures even being discussed because it
 
03:32:15.650 --> 03:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass the first litmus test that
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
I have is how does it help all the
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
people it's focused on helping just the
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
parties all right
 
03:32:24.239 --> 03:32:26.690 align:start position:0%
parties all right
um

03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
all right it actually does the worst of
 
03:32:31.670 --> 03:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
the ox is the opposite it's creating
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
more barriers and obstacles to get
 
03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
people to get involved one of the things
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
that the representative didn't mention
 
03:32:41.210 --> 03:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
when he talks about how many people
 
03:32:43.610 --> 03:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
participated in the primary it's an
 
03:32:45.530 --> 03:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
incredibly small number
 
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
all right we should be focused on what
 
03:32:49.550 --> 03:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
do we need to get to do to get more
 
03:32:52.790 --> 03:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
people across the board involved in
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
voting in the primaries this is a Jim
 
03:32:57.530 --> 03:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
Crow type of of law that we're putting
 
03:33:00.290 --> 03:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
and we're having to spend our time to to
 
03:33:02.690 --> 03:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
work on this all right I'm not going to
 
03:33:04.610 --> 03:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
go line item by lie item on this measure
 
03:33:07.130 --> 03:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
you know cutting it to shreds because I
 
03:33:08.510 --> 03:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
assume no one's really going to be
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
supporting this moving forward
 
03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
um because it as it was mentioned
 
03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
earlier things like this if it does pass
 
03:33:17.870 --> 03:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
we'll drive even more polarization and
 
03:33:19.729 --> 03:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
that's not what we need
 
03:33:22.010 --> 03:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
um and I think one of the questions you
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
know pointed out one of the absurdities
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
of the way it's written today the dates
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
may change but as an Undeclared voter
 
03:33:30.349 --> 03:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
you want me to pick my party before I
 
03:33:32.210 --> 03:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
even know who's running the filing
 
03:33:34.190 --> 03:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
period doesn't even start before this
 
03:33:36.050 --> 03:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
the clock starts how am I going to know
 
03:33:37.610 --> 03:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
which side I want to vote for when I
 
03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't even know who's put their name in
 
03:33:41.210 --> 03:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
the Hat all right it's impossible to
 
03:33:43.070 --> 03:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
make that decision as an Undeclared
 
03:33:46.130 --> 03:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
voter all right
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you know you also have to remember
 
03:33:50.030 --> 03:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
that our constitution does not say we
 
03:33:52.250 --> 03:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
must have political parties our state
 
03:33:54.410 --> 03:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
laws are set up so that they can't exist
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
all right do the political parties pay
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
for these primaries no they do not all
 
03:34:02.330 --> 03:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
right they're a gift from all of us that
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
we contribute to make them happen all
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
right this committee may be secretary
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
Scanlon could help I have no idea what
 
03:34:12.050 --> 03:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office has to
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
spend to produce all those ballots
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
manage it control all that Etc you got
 
03:34:19.010 --> 03:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
the supervisor of the checklist I mean
 
03:34:20.929 --> 03:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
the primary jobs to make sure who can
 
03:34:22.969 --> 03:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
vote in the general elections in the
 
03:34:25.010 --> 03:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
local elections you know keeping track
 
03:34:26.690 --> 03:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
of the R's and D's and everything else
 
03:34:29.450 --> 03:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
is an additional task that also we have
 
03:34:31.729 --> 03:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
to pay for just some back of the
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
envelope math My Town 2022 budget had a
 
03:34:37.490 --> 03:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollar line item uh that
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
was for three elections so if we take a
 
03:34:41.570 --> 03:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
third of that all right that's ten
 
03:34:44.210 --> 03:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars there's 326 polling
 
03:34:46.849 --> 03:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
stations across Hampshire all right
 
03:34:49.370 --> 03:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
let's round down call that three million
 
03:34:51.769 --> 03:34:51.779 align:start position:0%
dollars all right that is spent on those
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
primaries don't even talk in the
 
03:34:55.250 --> 03:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
presidential primary just the president
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
that we're spending
 
03:35:00.110 --> 03:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
um we heard that you know the numbers
 
03:35:01.969 --> 03:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
the last posted from the Secretary of
 
03:35:04.370 --> 03:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
State 36 percent the representative said
 
03:35:06.530 --> 03:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's around 40 they're Undeclared voters
 
03:35:08.690 --> 03:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
but if we just call that a third us
 
03:35:10.969 --> 03:35:10.979 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters are paying a million
 
03:35:10.979 --> 03:35:12.110 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters are paying a million
dollars

03:35:12.110 --> 03:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:35:14.929 --> 03:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
a year for primaries that it's going to
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
be very difficult to participate and
 
03:35:19.309 --> 03:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
that you're raising the bar for us to
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
get involved with
 
03:35:22.729 --> 03:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
um the earlier speaker mentioned and I
 
03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
assume that uh representative Moffett is
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to start working with the
 
03:35:28.370 --> 03:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative Reed behind me who is
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
putting forth on legislation to rank
 
03:35:33.290 --> 03:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
Choice voting I think if he you know put
 
03:35:35.450 --> 03:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
his efforts and others behind ranked
 
03:35:37.670 --> 03:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
Choice voting this bill would have never
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
ever come because we won't need it when
 
03:35:41.090 --> 03:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
there's things like right choice voting
 
03:35:44.450 --> 03:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
any questions for me
 
03:35:47.330 --> 03:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'll answer them
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
there do not appear to be any thank you
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
all right you and you came late last
 
03:35:53.630 --> 03:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
year I gave um the last chairman a copy
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
of my book but I didn't bring any with
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:13.729 --> 03:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:36:13.739 --> 03:36:15.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:36:15.590 --> 03:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:18.469 --> 03:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
I have a copy of my statement and I'm
 
03:36:20.929 --> 03:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
probably just going to read it but
 
03:36:23.030 --> 03:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
before I do that
 
03:36:24.830 --> 03:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to comment on a couple
 
03:36:27.590 --> 03:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
things that are not in my statement
 
03:36:29.269 --> 03:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
um I would I would like to draw your
 
03:36:30.650 --> 03:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
attention to a group called open
 
03:36:32.990 --> 03:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
primaries they may or may not have
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
submitted something online for this I
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
don't know there's also a group called
 
03:36:40.729 --> 03:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
Center for a an independent and
 
03:36:43.190 --> 03:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
sustainable democracy that just opened
 
03:36:45.769 --> 03:36:45.779 align:start position:0%
up at Arizona State University
 
03:36:47.929 --> 03:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
and both groups are doing a lot of
 
03:36:51.050 --> 03:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
research on the impact of independent
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
voters in our country and on open versus
 
03:36:55.010 --> 03:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
closed primaries
 
03:36:59.110 --> 03:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
and I know that open primaries recently
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
sponsored a a research project that was
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
done out of Princeton University that
 
03:37:07.969 --> 03:37:07.979 align:start position:0%
showed that in very very that there
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
really is very little Mischief that
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
takes place in open primaries I know it
 
03:37:17.170 --> 03:37:17.180 align:start position:0%
was somewhat of an issue this last year
 
03:37:20.330 --> 03:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
but overall when they do the research it
 
03:37:22.969 --> 03:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
it gets more attention and more word
 
03:37:25.610 --> 03:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
than the actual data shows that the
 
03:37:26.990 --> 03:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
actual data shows that there's very
 
03:37:30.050 --> 03:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
little Mischief that takes place in open
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
primaries by party rating that that
 
03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
really does not happen it is talked
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
about and maybe a very few people do it
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
but it's not something that impacts the
 
03:37:38.160 --> 03:37:40.150 align:start position:0%
but it's not something that impacts the
outcome

03:37:40.150 --> 03:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
03:37:43.250 --> 03:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
so I of course am speaking today in
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
opposition of HB 101
 
03:37:47.889 --> 03:37:47.899 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of Amherst New Hampshire
 
03:37:50.690 --> 03:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
my family and I have resided here for
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
nearly nine and a half years
 
03:37:56.570 --> 03:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
I'm registered as an independent
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
Undeclared with a party
 
03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'm also the president of New Hampshire
 
03:38:03.530 --> 03:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
independent voters as well as president
 
03:38:05.090 --> 03:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire ranked Choice voting
 
03:38:06.410 --> 03:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
but I speak today
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
in my hat as president of New Hampshire
 
03:38:11.450 --> 03:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
independent voters and as as a resident
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
and Undeclared voter myself
 
03:38:17.269 --> 03:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
um both of those groups are 100 percent
 
03:38:19.969 --> 03:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
uh comprised of Citizen volunteers and
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
are nonpartisan and non-profit
 
03:38:24.830 --> 03:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
I'm also a licensed attorney here in the
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
03:38:28.849 --> 03:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
I have spoken before on similar bills in
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
the past and some of you have already
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
heard what I have to say but I noticed
 
03:38:34.130 --> 03:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
that this committee is comprised of many
 
03:38:36.410 --> 03:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
new members that have never heard these
 
03:38:38.090 --> 03:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
these things so
 
03:38:39.530 --> 03:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
as you've already heard today in New
 
03:38:40.849 --> 03:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are more voters who are
 
03:38:43.190 --> 03:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
registered as Independents or Undeclared
 
03:38:44.809 --> 03:38:44.819 align:start position:0%
than registered as either Republicans Or
 
03:38:47.570 --> 03:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
democrats then the numbers are always in
 
03:38:49.490 --> 03:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
flux but we have almost 40 percent
 
03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
registered Undeclared uh 31 registered
 
03:38:55.130 --> 03:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
Democrats and 30 percent registered
 
03:38:57.170 --> 03:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
Republicans in the state of New
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the last data that I
 
03:38:59.040 --> 03:39:00.110 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the last data that I
checked

03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
checked
 
03:39:03.050 --> 03:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a long tradition
 
03:39:05.269 --> 03:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
of allowing this large independent
 
03:39:08.150 --> 03:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voting Bloc to participate in
 
03:39:10.450 --> 03:39:10.460 align:start position:0%
its state-funded primary elections
 
03:39:12.650 --> 03:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
uncleared voters are currently allowed
 
03:39:14.510 --> 03:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
to show up at the primary election on
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
primary election day choose a party's
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
ballot cast their vote and then they can
 
03:39:21.769 --> 03:39:21.779 align:start position:0%
reassert their desire to be Undeclared
 
03:39:23.389 --> 03:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
on their way out the door
 
03:39:26.090 --> 03:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
but by requiring voters to register with
 
03:39:28.250 --> 03:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
the party at least four months before
 
03:39:29.809 --> 03:39:29.819 align:start position:0%
the primary election in order to be
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote in the primary HB 101
 
03:39:35.150 --> 03:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
would do away with this tradition and it
 
03:39:36.769 --> 03:39:36.779 align:start position:0%
would disenfranchise independent
 
03:39:38.870 --> 03:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters who have purposely
 
03:39:40.670 --> 03:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
chosen not to affiliate with the
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
political party
 
03:39:44.450 --> 03:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
we New Hampshire independent voters
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
assert that no person no person should
 
03:39:50.090 --> 03:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
be required to register with a political
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
party as a condition of voting in a
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
determinative public election
 
03:39:58.490 --> 03:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
Although our current Party primary
 
03:40:00.469 --> 03:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
system is for the selection of party
 
03:40:00.479 --> 03:40:01.849 align:start position:0%
system is for the selection of party
nominees

03:40:01.849 --> 03:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
nominees
 
03:40:04.250 --> 03:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
that selection will determine who will
 
03:40:05.929 --> 03:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
appear on the general election ballot
 
03:40:08.809 --> 03:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
and it has a huge ramifications as to
 
03:40:10.429 --> 03:40:10.439 align:start position:0%
who are representatives in public office
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
will ultimately ultimately be
 
03:40:15.050 --> 03:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
independent voters should not be shut
 
03:40:18.349 --> 03:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
out from these consequential decisions
 
03:40:20.269 --> 03:40:20.279 align:start position:0%
although I have not had the opportunity
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
this year to contact the leaders of the
 
03:40:24.889 --> 03:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
Democratic and Republican parties about
 
03:40:27.349 --> 03:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
their position on HB 101
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
I do believe that this committee should
 
03:40:30.530 --> 03:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
do so
 
03:40:33.769 --> 03:40:33.779 align:start position:0%
because if either party is opposed to
 
03:40:34.670 --> 03:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:40:37.790 --> 03:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would be unconstitutional
 
03:40:40.370 --> 03:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
public records shows that the parties
 
03:40:43.190 --> 03:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
were against a similar bill in the past
 
03:40:46.670 --> 03:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I have a source here
 
03:40:46.680 --> 03:40:47.570 align:start position:0%
and I have a source here
um

03:40:47.570 --> 03:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:49.309 --> 03:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
this is a quote from the source that
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
came from the Republican bylaws
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee I think it was of 2021
 
03:40:56.210 --> 03:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
if we were to adopt a close primary it
 
03:40:58.490 --> 03:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
would be very likely result in a drop in
 
03:41:00.590 --> 03:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
participation in Republican primaries
 
03:41:02.510 --> 03:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
and or a boost in registered Democrats
 
03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
it may also put our first in the nation
 
03:41:07.010 --> 03:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
presidential primary in Jeopardy by
 
03:41:08.570 --> 03:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of Voters who would
 
03:41:08.580 --> 03:41:10.010 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of Voters who would
participate

03:41:10.010 --> 03:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
participate
 
03:41:11.450 --> 03:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
I believe that the New Hampshire
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
Democratic party would also feel similar
 
03:41:17.929 --> 03:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
similarly about closing their primaries
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
if the parties themselves are opposed to
 
03:41:22.190 --> 03:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
closing their primaries the state should
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
not close them by Fiat not only do
 
03:41:27.889 --> 03:41:27.899 align:start position:0%
independent voters believe independent
 
03:41:30.110 --> 03:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
voters are group we believe that it's a
 
03:41:31.849 --> 03:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
violation of the equal protection clause
 
03:41:34.010 --> 03:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
for parties to close state funded
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
primaries although the uh are for
 
03:41:39.309 --> 03:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
parties to use the state to close
 
03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
state-funded primaries
 
03:41:43.130 --> 03:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
although that has not been determined
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's just what we believe should be
 
03:41:46.370 --> 03:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
the determination
 
03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
but what the Supreme Court has
 
03:41:48.060 --> 03:41:49.250 align:start position:0%
but what the Supreme Court has
determined

03:41:49.250 --> 03:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
determined
 
03:41:50.929 --> 03:41:50.939 align:start position:0%
and they have opined that it's
 
03:41:53.210 --> 03:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional a violation of the
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
right of Association
 
03:41:57.290 --> 03:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
for the state to close primaries when
 
03:42:00.530 --> 03:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
the parties desire them to be open
 
03:42:02.690 --> 03:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
and that comes from
 
03:42:05.870 --> 03:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
the case tajahan versus Republican party
 
03:42:07.510 --> 03:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
of Connecticut
 
03:42:09.950 --> 03:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
1986 case
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
so as an Undeclared voter in New
 
03:42:12.889 --> 03:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as president of New
 
03:42:14.030 --> 03:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire independent voters I
 
03:42:17.090 --> 03:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask you to vote HB 101 to
 
03:42:19.490 --> 03:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
be inexpedient to legislate as it will
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
just disenfranchise so many independent
 
03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters we independent voters
 
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
do not vote based on party we tend to
 
03:42:27.889 --> 03:42:27.899 align:start position:0%
view issues in a more careful and
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
nuanced fashion than simply accepting
 
03:42:32.750 --> 03:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
the party line or party talking point
 
03:42:34.610 --> 03:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to candidates we
 
03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
prefer to vote for the person over the
 
03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:37.370 align:start position:0%
prefer to vote for the person over the
party

03:42:37.370 --> 03:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
party
 
03:42:39.410 --> 03:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
sometimes we may select a republican
 
03:42:40.969 --> 03:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
ballot sometimes we may select a
 
03:42:43.490 --> 03:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
democratic ballot and not for Mischief
 
03:42:45.110 --> 03:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
but because that's based on our
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
conscience of who we want to vote for
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
the most we wish we could vote for
 
03:42:50.570 --> 03:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
different parties and different races
 
03:42:52.490 --> 03:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
but we have to vote all one party in One
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
race even as it stands now it'll be even
 
03:42:56.450 --> 03:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
worse if we have to register four months
 
03:42:58.130 --> 03:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
before we probably just won't vote in
 
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
the primary which is really sad
 
03:43:03.290 --> 03:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
so for the um sometimes we vote for
 
03:43:04.729 --> 03:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
third party or independent candidates it
 
03:43:05.929 --> 03:43:05.939 align:start position:0%
always depends on the issues and
 
03:43:05.939 --> 03:43:07.370 align:start position:0%
always depends on the issues and
circumstances

03:43:07.370 --> 03:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:43:09.410 --> 03:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
so for this and other reasons we do not
 
03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
want to be required to register with the
 
03:43:12.889 --> 03:43:12.899 align:start position:0%
political party in order to have our
 
03:43:14.570 --> 03:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
voice heard in determinative primary
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
elections in order to have a say as to
 
03:43:18.290 --> 03:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
who will appear on the general election
 
03:43:18.300 --> 03:43:19.790 align:start position:0%
who will appear on the general election
ballot

03:43:19.790 --> 03:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:25.370 --> 03:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:55.010 --> 03:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:58.010 --> 03:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn thank you and it's a
 
03:43:59.330 --> 03:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
simple question
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm taking I'm taking uh the clerk's
 
03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
place and you mentioned a group in
 
03:44:07.250 --> 03:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
Arizona and I just wanted to get the
 
03:44:08.809 --> 03:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
name of it because I couldn't write best
 
03:44:08.819 --> 03:44:10.250 align:start position:0%
name of it because I couldn't write best
enough

03:44:10.250 --> 03:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
enough
 
03:44:13.130 --> 03:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
it's the center for an independent and
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.130 --> 03:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:48.410 --> 03:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay we're under we're in a lot of
 
03:44:50.330 --> 03:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
pressure to be nice and not too partisan
 
03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll I will uh abide I will
 
03:44:56.809 --> 03:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
abide by that as well well as I can um
 
03:44:58.849 --> 03:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
well first of all some of the claims
 
03:45:00.530 --> 03:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett to claim I find
 
03:45:04.250 --> 03:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh implausible um being bipartisanship I
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
happen to be a friend of uh over at
 
03:45:08.150 --> 03:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
LaMontagne who have a lot of respect for
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
even though I disagree with him on many
 
03:45:12.290 --> 03:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
issues and I'm pretty sure uh
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
he won that primary back in 1996 because
 
03:45:17.929 --> 03:45:17.939 align:start position:0%
more Republicans favored him over uh
 
03:45:21.590 --> 03:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
whoever it was Bill zeliff and he came
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh he's come close in a couple other
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
primaries I think certainly his success
 
03:45:27.530 --> 03:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
is not because of Democrats crossing
 
03:45:30.889 --> 03:45:30.899 align:start position:0%
over to metal in the primary I'm a very
 
03:45:33.889 --> 03:45:33.899 align:start position:0%
I'm a very partisan Democrat I'm also a
 
03:45:36.229 --> 03:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
member of my town committee as well as a
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
rep and I can guarantee you that
 
03:45:43.010 --> 03:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
we're not we're just not organizing to
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
get people to vote in the other party's
 
03:45:45.950 --> 03:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
primary we have enough trouble getting
 
03:45:48.349 --> 03:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
people to vote in our own primary for
 
03:45:51.050 --> 03:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
candidates they like and
 
03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
some some of the more independent uh
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
Democratic minors voters might
 
03:45:57.530 --> 03:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
occasionally cross over to Republican
 
03:45:59.450 --> 03:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
primary if they think ours is boring but
 
03:46:00.710 --> 03:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
that would be more
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
to vote against someone they really
 
03:46:04.309 --> 03:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't like rather than putting someone
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
who's a weak candidate uh and just to
 
03:46:10.729 --> 03:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
increase the Democrats chance and um you
 
03:46:12.290 --> 03:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
know both parties
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
both parties uh we I have to admit have
 
03:46:16.729 --> 03:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
put up some pretty questionable uh
 
03:46:16.739 --> 03:46:18.229 align:start position:0%
put up some pretty questionable uh
candidates

03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
03:46:18.239 --> 03:46:19.010 align:start position:0%
candidates
um

03:46:19.010 --> 03:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:21.950 --> 03:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh I think Bob Burns also probably beat
 
03:46:23.750 --> 03:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
George Hansel fair and square that was
 
03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
not because of anything Andy Custer
 
03:46:27.170 --> 03:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
doing George hansel's problem was
 
03:46:29.330 --> 03:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
probably that Andy Custer was much
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
better at being a Democrat than than he
 
03:46:34.250 --> 03:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
was but you know I uh Bob Burns I don't
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
think was that terrible the candidate
 
03:46:35.760 --> 03:46:36.710 align:start position:0%
think was that terrible the candidate
and

03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:36.720 --> 03:46:38.330 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:46:38.330 --> 03:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:40.370 --> 03:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we've had we had like
 
03:46:42.110 --> 03:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
we've had like three very weak uh
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
Governors candidates and we did a lot
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
better when we got uh Senator Sherman
 
03:46:46.610 --> 03:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
and I
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't think Molly Kelly or Colin van
 
03:46:51.290 --> 03:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
Oster or Dan feltis won because
 
03:46:52.910 --> 03:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
Republicans were crossing over and
 
03:46:54.410 --> 03:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
voting in our primary they won our
 
03:46:57.410 --> 03:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
primaries on the road merits and they
 
03:46:58.729 --> 03:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
did the best they could in both the
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
primary and the general election so
 
03:47:04.490 --> 03:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is uh certainly
 
03:47:07.010 --> 03:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
anti-small D Democratic it's also taking
 
03:47:09.190 --> 03:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
away a long-established right that our
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
citizens most of whom are neither most
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
of whom are registered as Undeclared and
 
03:47:16.610 --> 03:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
even most of the Republicans and
 
03:47:19.370 --> 03:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
Democrats are not as partisan as those
 
03:47:20.990 --> 03:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
of us who are
 
03:47:24.769 --> 03:47:24.779 align:start position:0%
office or lead the party apparatus
 
03:47:26.929 --> 03:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
so I think it's unfair it's unfair that
 
03:47:28.490 --> 03:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
it takes away A Long established right
 
03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
at a time when there's a perception that
 
03:47:33.229 --> 03:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
voting rights are under attack and um
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
it's also it's also unnecessary I mean
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you uh
 
03:47:39.710 --> 03:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
rather than mandating close primaries I
 
03:47:40.969 --> 03:47:40.979 align:start position:0%
think there's already a provision that
 
03:47:42.710 --> 03:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
they can have a convention if already
 
03:47:45.769 --> 03:47:45.779 align:start position:0%
prefers not to have a primary and if you
 
03:47:47.530 --> 03:47:47.540 align:start position:0%
want to allow foreign
 
03:47:50.450 --> 03:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
area that uh
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
idea might have some bear in mind it
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
would be incredibly unpopular and
 
03:47:56.210 --> 03:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
probably would not help that party at
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
all in the uh in the general election so
 
03:47:58.560 --> 03:47:59.990 align:start position:0%
all in the uh in the general election so
I

03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:48:03.170 --> 03:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
just speaking as a so just anyways just
 
03:48:04.610 --> 03:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
begins to state representative and the
 
03:48:06.170 --> 03:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
citizen of New Hampshire and also like
 
03:48:10.190 --> 03:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh somebody who uh somebody who
 
03:48:12.530 --> 03:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
has a certain affection for overall
 
03:48:14.690 --> 03:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
maintained in particular who I think was
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
unfairly uh maligned here I would say uh
 
03:48:18.769 --> 03:48:18.779 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
03:48:22.190 --> 03:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
a terrible idea and uh you should uh itl
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
it at your first opportunity thanks
 
03:48:28.490 --> 03:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:48:28.500 --> 03:48:31.429 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:37.490 --> 03:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.870 --> 03:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and honorable members
 
03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
03:48:51.469 --> 03:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
is Ellen Reed and I represent Newmarket
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
and new fields and I have to admit I
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
feel kind of bad because I feel like
 
03:48:57.050 --> 03:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
we've been beating up on the prime
 
03:49:00.769 --> 03:49:00.779 align:start position:0%
sponsor so far non-stop uh string of
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
opposed but um I I am also opposed to
 
03:49:06.170 --> 03:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
this bill but I'm glad I heard the prime
 
03:49:08.929 --> 03:49:08.939 align:start position:0%
sponsor introduce the the rationale
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
behind it it may surprise the prime
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor although it probably doesn't
 
03:49:16.849 --> 03:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
surprise anybody who knows me well that
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
I actually uh was also very much opposed
 
03:49:24.290 --> 03:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
to what we heard in media the behavior
 
03:49:26.690 --> 03:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
of one party trying to interfere in the
 
03:49:28.910 --> 03:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
other party's primary this last election
 
03:49:31.610 --> 03:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
cycle and in fact I signed an online
 
03:49:34.610 --> 03:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
petition I would happily add my name to
 
03:49:36.530 --> 03:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
the list of names that the prime sponsor
 
03:49:36.540 --> 03:49:37.969 align:start position:0%
the list of names that the prime sponsor
mentioned

03:49:37.969 --> 03:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:49:39.889 --> 03:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think that this bill is
 
03:49:42.530 --> 03:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
the right way to go about fixing that
 
03:49:45.050 --> 03:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
particular type of problem I would be in
 
03:49:49.190 --> 03:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
favor of making the behavior of a party
 
03:49:51.530 --> 03:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
interfering in another party's primary
 
03:49:53.570 --> 03:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
illegal but this bill doesn't go after
 
03:49:56.929 --> 03:49:56.939 align:start position:0%
parties The Spill goes after voters
 
03:49:59.210 --> 03:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
this bill goes specifically after
 
03:50:02.929 --> 03:50:02.939 align:start position:0%
independent voters in a state that's not
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
just majority you know majority or
 
03:50:08.290 --> 03:50:08.300 align:start position:0%
plurality independent voters but proudly
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
independent we are proudly independent
 
03:50:13.490 --> 03:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
as a state I should have included in my
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
introduction that along with Tiani I was
 
03:50:19.130 --> 03:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
one of the the founding members of New
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire independent voters long before
 
03:50:23.210 --> 03:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
I ran for office when she founded that
 
03:50:27.889 --> 03:50:27.899 align:start position:0%
organization so when I see a bill that
 
03:50:30.530 --> 03:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
I mean imagine as a voter that you're
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
used to same-day registration you're
 
03:50:34.910 --> 03:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
used to all of this kind of small D
 
03:50:37.130 --> 03:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
democracy we have and we're so proud of
 
03:50:38.929 --> 03:50:38.939 align:start position:0%
in this state and that you show up and
 
03:50:41.450 --> 03:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
to vote and I mean how many thousands of
 
03:50:45.530 --> 03:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
people would be denied on primary day
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
um and again as was already stated by I
 
03:50:50.210 --> 03:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
think it's worth reiterating the
 
03:50:51.710 --> 03:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
deadline that's put forward in the bill
 
03:50:54.410 --> 03:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
is before the candidates would be able
 
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
to even file
 
03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
so how in the world would you be able to
 
03:51:01.490 --> 03:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
choose which party to vote in
 
03:51:03.950 --> 03:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that the prime
 
03:51:07.130 --> 03:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned is a rationale of this
 
03:51:10.130 --> 03:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
may be a really pervasive problem of of
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
parties interfering in each other's
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
primaries was the idea that if you have
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
a primary on one side and the turnout in
 
03:51:19.010 --> 03:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
the primary is lower than what that
 
03:51:20.990 --> 03:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
candidate gets in the general then that
 
03:51:24.710 --> 03:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
looks suspicious but that's not actually
 
03:51:26.570 --> 03:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
how that works
 
03:51:29.330 --> 03:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
primary turnout is based on the horse
 
03:51:32.929 --> 03:51:32.939 align:start position:0%
raciness of the primary this past
 
03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
election cycle I'll just speak as a
 
03:51:37.370 --> 03:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
Democrat the Democrats did not have very
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
interesting primaries we did not have
 
03:51:42.410 --> 03:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
very interesting primaries for any of
 
03:51:45.050 --> 03:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
the major offices and so our turnout was
 
03:51:47.030 --> 03:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
quite low in the primary but that
 
03:51:48.650 --> 03:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they were all voting
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
in the other party's primary it just
 
03:51:52.010 --> 03:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
means they didn't bother to come out to
 
03:51:54.110 --> 03:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
to vote in the primary whereas they were
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
motivated to vote in the general so just
 
03:51:59.090 --> 03:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
because you have those low turnout
 
03:52:01.190 --> 03:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
numbers in a and I think the prime
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor admitted that the gene sheehyun
 
03:52:07.010 --> 03:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
race was a uncontested gubernatorial uh
 
03:52:09.650 --> 03:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
primary election so you're going to have
 
03:52:12.410 --> 03:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
low turnout it's uncontested that
 
03:52:13.849 --> 03:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that there's you know
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
Shenanigans afoot however I will say
 
03:52:17.870 --> 03:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
because there have been it has been
 
03:52:20.090 --> 03:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
evidence of shenanigans as is the case
 
03:52:22.729 --> 03:52:22.739 align:start position:0%
with the the news reports we heard of
 
03:52:25.010 --> 03:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
this last election cycle that those
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
Shenanigans are exactly why AI voters
 
03:52:31.190 --> 03:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
become independent to begin with the the
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
idea that the two-party system is bitter
 
03:52:35.210 --> 03:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
and divided and polarizing and we hate
 
03:52:37.010 --> 03:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
each other and we're always like going
 
03:52:39.530 --> 03:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
after each other it's why people want to
 
03:52:42.830 --> 03:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
be Undeclared to begin with and so to
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
punish those people I don't think is
 
03:52:46.429 --> 03:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
fair and I don't think it actually is
 
03:52:48.889 --> 03:52:48.899 align:start position:0%
going to um get at the heart of the
 
03:52:48.899 --> 03:52:50.090 align:start position:0%
going to um get at the heart of the
problem

03:52:50.090 --> 03:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:52:52.849 --> 03:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
I will also say that the prime sponsor
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
might be gratified and perhaps less
 
03:52:56.929 --> 03:52:56.939 align:start position:0%
angry at me if I'd tell him that when I
 
03:52:58.670 --> 03:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
teach American government I always show
 
03:53:01.490 --> 03:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
my students a clip from Mr Smith Goes to
 
03:53:01.500 --> 03:53:02.389 align:start position:0%
my students a clip from Mr Smith Goes to
Washington

03:53:02.389 --> 03:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
03:53:04.490 --> 03:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
but um with that I'll end it I'll take
 
03:53:08.690 --> 03:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:11.450 --> 03:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:53:14.269 --> 03:53:14.279 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:53:18.769 --> 03:53:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:35.570 --> 03:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.610 --> 03:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:53:39.769 --> 03:53:39.779 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Alvin C and I
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
represent Merrimack District 26 which is
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
a floaterial district with eight towns
 
03:53:48.410 --> 03:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
in it I support
 
03:53:51.889 --> 03:53:51.899 align:start position:0%
House Bill 101 I feel it's important for
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
voters in primary elections to associate
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
with a party to which they want to vote
 
03:53:56.640 --> 03:53:57.910 align:start position:0%
with a party to which they want to vote
in

03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
a primary specifically for party
 
03:54:04.490 --> 03:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
organization not for generals uh
 
03:54:07.389 --> 03:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
accommodation of the public
 
03:54:09.650 --> 03:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
if you're not interested in
 
03:54:11.990 --> 03:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
participating in a party
 
03:54:16.190 --> 03:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
then the primary is not a good place to
 
03:54:16.200 --> 03:54:17.690 align:start position:0%
then the primary is not a good place to
be

03:54:17.690 --> 03:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:54:17.700 --> 03:54:18.229 align:start position:0%
be
um

03:54:18.229 --> 03:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
the main thing on the
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh primaries is
 
03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
to replace the
 
03:54:26.819 --> 03:54:27.530 align:start position:0%
to replace the
um

03:54:27.530 --> 03:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:30.650 --> 03:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
so-called back room deals in party
 
03:54:33.410 --> 03:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
conventions which previously were used
 
03:54:36.349 --> 03:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
to select party candidates was always by
 
03:54:36.359 --> 03:54:37.790 align:start position:0%
to select party candidates was always by
convention

03:54:37.790 --> 03:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
convention
 
03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:39.469 align:start position:0%
convention
and

03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:42.050 --> 03:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of
 
03:54:43.849 --> 03:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
wheeling and dealing and everything else
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
that went on in in those back rooms and
 
03:54:48.530 --> 03:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's what people wanted to get away
 
03:54:51.290 --> 03:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
from so that's why we have state paid
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
for primary elections but it is still
 
03:54:55.920 --> 03:54:56.830 align:start position:0%
for primary elections but it is still
um

03:54:56.830 --> 03:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:01.250 --> 03:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the individual parties as
 
03:55:04.490 --> 03:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
to selecting their candidates to run in
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
the general election
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
anyone who
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't really want to associate with a
 
03:55:11.760 --> 03:55:12.769 align:start position:0%
doesn't really want to associate with a
party

03:55:12.769 --> 03:55:12.779 align:start position:0%
party
 
03:55:15.410 --> 03:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
and the parties have statements of
 
03:55:17.630 --> 03:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
principles or party platforms or however
 
03:55:20.809 --> 03:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
you want to refer to it so that you can
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
decide for yourself whether that's a
 
03:55:25.309 --> 03:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
group you want to associate with
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of who's who the candidates
 
03:55:27.600 --> 03:55:28.510 align:start position:0%
regardless of who's who the candidates
are

03:55:28.510 --> 03:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:55:32.150 --> 03:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
then your your turn to participate is in
 
03:55:33.650 --> 03:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
the general election
 
03:55:37.130 --> 03:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh that's where everybody votes for no
 
03:55:39.290 --> 03:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
matter who who the parties are including
 
03:55:42.290 --> 03:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
minor parties and everything else
 
03:55:42.300 --> 03:55:45.910 align:start position:0%
minor parties and everything else
um

03:55:45.910 --> 03:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:48.729 --> 03:55:48.739 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:55:52.010 --> 03:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
as far as the bill itself is concerned I
 
03:55:54.189 --> 03:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
do uh
 
03:55:57.050 --> 03:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
suggests that you set it up if you were
 
03:55:59.210 --> 03:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
going to pass this to accommodate
 
03:56:01.790 --> 03:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
possible moving of the primaries
 
03:56:05.150 --> 03:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
so that this doesn't become an
 
03:56:05.160 --> 03:56:06.170 align:start position:0%
so that this doesn't become an
accidental

03:56:06.170 --> 03:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
accidental
 
03:56:08.870 --> 03:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
oversight when that happens
 
03:56:12.889 --> 03:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
and also on line 27 where it says the
 
03:56:15.170 --> 03:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
day before that should now say the day
 
03:56:17.410 --> 03:56:17.420 align:start position:0%
after that day before
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh was in there to accommodate people
 
03:56:26.269 --> 03:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
who were going to vote on primary day to
 
03:56:29.210 --> 03:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
pick a ballot by choosing which party to
 
03:56:29.220 --> 03:56:30.349 align:start position:0%
pick a ballot by choosing which party to
join

03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
join
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
voting in the
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
on that ballot and then getting out of
 
03:56:38.530 --> 03:56:38.540 align:start position:0%
that party so technically
 
03:56:41.450 --> 03:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh by joining a party and taking a
 
03:56:43.309 --> 03:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
ballot from that party
 
03:56:45.530 --> 03:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
you are a member of the party so it's a
 
03:56:48.410 --> 03:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
closed primary it's only people who are
 
03:56:50.330 --> 03:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
registered in that party get the vote on
 
03:56:52.370 --> 03:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
that ballot it's just that some people
 
03:56:54.910 --> 03:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it and are able to
 
03:56:57.050 --> 03:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
disassociate with the party immediately
 
03:56:59.349 --> 03:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
after the election
 
03:57:03.889 --> 03:57:03.899 align:start position:0%
I feel this uh Bill a lot to pass and I
 
03:57:05.150 --> 03:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
wish to thank you and I'll take any
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
03:57:08.990 --> 03:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:57:19.490 --> 03:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:35.040 --> 03:57:36.170 align:start position:0%
 
hello

03:57:36.170 --> 03:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
hello
 
03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
um my name is Sam Bourne I'm 18 years
 
03:57:40.729 --> 03:57:40.739 align:start position:0%
old I live in Rye and I was a graduate
 
03:57:43.490 --> 03:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
of Portsmouth High School in 2022. I am
 
03:57:46.670 --> 03:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
here to speak against the bill because I
 
03:57:48.050 --> 03:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
believe fundamentally it will lower
 
03:57:50.450 --> 03:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
voter turnout what you are doing and
 
03:57:51.950 --> 03:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
what this bill is going to do is it will
 
03:57:53.809 --> 03:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
increase it will add an increase in a
 
03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
restriction making it harder for people
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
to vote in the primary I know there's a
 
03:57:58.849 --> 03:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
line in the bill that says it's going to
 
03:58:00.530 --> 03:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
educate voters to change their party
 
03:58:02.150 --> 03:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
registration four months ahead of time
 
03:58:04.969 --> 03:58:04.979 align:start position:0%
and my experience dealing with kids my
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
age that is incredibly unlikely right
 
03:58:08.269 --> 03:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
now the youth voter turnover rate and
 
03:58:10.370 --> 03:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
the general election for kids 18 to 19
 
03:58:12.490 --> 03:58:12.500 align:start position:0%
is at 13
 
03:58:16.309 --> 03:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
getting kids my age 18 19 College age to
 
03:58:18.530 --> 03:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
turn out and vote in general elections
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
much less the primaries is almost
 
03:58:23.750 --> 03:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
impossible if you want to have kids do
 
03:58:26.450 --> 03:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
something four months ahead of time that
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
is not going to happen I mean two three
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
percent might switch their party
 
03:58:35.570 --> 03:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
registration in time but the future of
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
this country youth voter turnout in the
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
primaries in is not going to happen and
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to decrease
 
03:58:45.229 --> 03:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
registration in those primaries I think
 
03:58:46.849 --> 03:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
we can all agree that less people voting
 
03:58:49.370 --> 03:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
in elections is a bad thing for
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
democracy Now the second point is what
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
problem does this bill actually solve
 
03:58:56.809 --> 03:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
now when presented the representative
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
gave two examples one case from 1996 and
 
03:59:03.229 --> 03:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
one case from 2022 and both of those
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
cases the Democratic elections with Gene
 
03:59:09.170 --> 03:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
shaquin in 1996 and Annie Custer in 2022
 
03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
she ran unopposed the two Republican
 
03:59:15.170 --> 03:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
primaries by contrast had two candidates
 
03:59:17.750 --> 03:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
running for those nominations so it
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
makes a lot more sense that people
 
03:59:21.050 --> 03:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
aren't going to vote in an election
 
03:59:23.929 --> 03:59:23.939 align:start position:0%
where it's uncontested as opposed to an
 
03:59:26.269 --> 03:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
election where there is a contest we can
 
03:59:27.410 --> 03:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
look at that and you can actually see
 
03:59:30.050 --> 03:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
and the primary results for Chris sununu
 
03:59:33.290 --> 03:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
in 2022 he only got 100
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
000 votes in the primary election give
 
03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
or take but in the general election he
 
03:59:40.490 --> 03:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
won but more than 350 000 votes where
 
03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
did those extra votes come from not from
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
just the Republican primaries but from
 
03:59:47.570 --> 03:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
in because people did not vote in the
 
03:59:49.729 --> 03:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
election because it was not contested
 
03:59:51.170 --> 03:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
what is happening in the different
 
03:59:52.729 --> 03:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
elections when people vote in primaries
 
03:59:53.929 --> 03:59:53.939 align:start position:0%
or not in primaries is because
 
03:59:56.570 --> 03:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
independent voters are choosing to come
 
03:59:58.010 --> 03:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
and vote in the election where it is
 
03:59:59.689 --> 03:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
contested people won't turn out if there
 
04:00:02.269 --> 04:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
isn't a race to vote for so the case is
 
04:00:05.870 --> 04:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
in the examples don't really hold and
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
you go to the third part
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the reason why the Democratic party
 
04:00:11.870 --> 04:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
the national Democratic party is moving
 
04:00:13.490 --> 04:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
to try to take away New Hampshire from
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
its presidential primary position one of
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
the reasons there's a law in place and
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State can go into more
 
04:00:20.510 --> 04:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
examples that New Hampshire has to be
 
04:00:22.490 --> 04:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
the first Primary in the nation what is
 
04:00:24.650 --> 04:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
going to happen in that case unlikely
 
04:00:26.510 --> 04:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
hard to tell but one of the reasons that
 
04:00:28.550 --> 04:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
they removed Iowa from the primary list
 
04:00:30.590 --> 04:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
is because they had caucuses caucuses
 
04:00:32.570 --> 04:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
mean that less people could turn out
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
this bill will be adding an increased
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
restriction meaning less people will be
 
04:00:39.050 --> 04:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
able to turn out in the primaries when
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
that happens that's going to give the
 
04:00:42.530 --> 04:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
national Democratic party one more
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
reason to help take the primary away
 
04:00:47.929 --> 04:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire by making it harder
 
04:00:50.570 --> 04:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
by lowering voter turnout the Democrats
 
04:00:52.309 --> 04:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
will have an increased incentive to take
 
04:00:54.410 --> 04:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
the primary away from New Hampshire I
 
04:00:56.330 --> 04:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
ask you not to give them one more reason
 
04:00:59.210 --> 04:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
to strip New Hampshire of that right now
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
the final part is that this state is the
 
04:01:04.250 --> 04:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die State you should be
 
04:01:07.370 --> 04:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
free to do what you want to do as Ronald
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
Reagan said government is not the
 
04:01:11.330 --> 04:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
solution government is the problem this
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
is an increased bill this is another
 
04:01:14.929 --> 04:01:14.939 align:start position:0%
bill that is putting another restriction
 
04:01:17.689 --> 04:01:17.699 align:start position:0%
and another mandate forcing people to
 
04:01:20.330 --> 04:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
what they can or cannot do as George
 
04:01:22.189 --> 04:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
Washington said
 
04:01:24.590 --> 04:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
political parties are potent engines by
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
which cunning and ambition and
 
04:01:28.370 --> 04:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
unprincipled men will be able to subvert
 
04:01:30.530 --> 04:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
the power of the people and usurp the
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
reins of government fundamentally this
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
bill will be decreasing the amount of
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
people who turn out in primaries it will
 
04:01:37.849 --> 04:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
be decreasing people's rights to
 
04:01:39.050 --> 04:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
exercise their political rights by
 
04:01:41.150 --> 04:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
adding another step to it making it
 
04:01:43.370 --> 04:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
harder and this will make this less of a
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
state I urge you to vote against this
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
bill because this is New Hampshire we
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to live free and die
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
and more government regulations and more
 
04:01:53.090 --> 04:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
government restrictions based on two
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
examples from 1996 and 2022 there is not
 
04:01:58.189 --> 04:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
a problem we do not need to be creating
 
04:01:59.929 --> 04:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
more regulations to solve a problem
 
04:02:03.410 --> 04:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
hurting democracy youth vote youth voter
 
04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
turnout the potential New Hampshire
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
primaries and this state's long-term
 
04:02:10.370 --> 04:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:14.689 --> 04:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
04:02:16.729 --> 04:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's not a question but I just want to
 
04:02:20.269 --> 04:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
say thank you for taking the time to
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%

04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
are there any actual questions all right
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.469 --> 04:02:51.479 align:start position:0%

all 234 cities and towns in New
Hampshire

04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
um we we do a number of things we
 
04:03:16.010 --> 04:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
provide legal advice to cities and towns
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
we do trainings that's probably what
 
04:03:19.610 --> 04:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
we're best known for we also come here
 
04:03:20.809 --> 04:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
and advocate
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our members based on the
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
policy positions that they adopt during
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
our legislative policy conference which
 
04:03:28.969 --> 04:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
occurs shortly before the general
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
election in each general election year
 
04:03:34.250 --> 04:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this uh piece of
 
04:03:34.260 --> 04:03:35.570 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this uh piece of
legislation

04:03:35.570 --> 04:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:03:38.410 --> 04:03:38.420 align:start position:0%
we have a policy position to support
 
04:03:40.670 --> 04:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
registration and voting processes that
 
04:03:42.349 --> 04:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
are not unnecessarily complex or
 
04:03:44.030 --> 04:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
burdensome either to voters or election
 
04:03:46.610 --> 04:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
officials you know under our existing
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
system it allows unaffiliated voters to
 
04:03:51.889 --> 04:03:51.899 align:start position:0%
decide which primary to vote in when
 
04:03:53.689 --> 04:03:53.699 align:start position:0%
they show up on Election Day it's a
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
well-known system it's well established
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
we've had it in place for about 30 years
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
now and it runs very well
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
so we think that is the appropriate
 
04:04:05.410 --> 04:04:05.420 align:start position:0%
policy position uh to keep at this time
 
04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
and of course you've heard from another
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh many other speakers uh with with
 
04:04:12.769 --> 04:04:12.779 align:start position:0%
other reasons as well I don't want to
 
04:04:14.030 --> 04:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
take up too much of the committee's time
 
04:04:15.590 --> 04:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions that
 
04:04:17.330 --> 04:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions
 
04:04:23.929 --> 04:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:04:25.490 --> 04:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
secretary Scanlon were you going to
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
testify or just here as a resource
 
04:04:33.050 --> 04:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
our uh four against it or just providing
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
information just providing information
 
04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Scanlon Secretary of
 
04:04:47.090 --> 04:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
State uh here not taking a position on
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
the bill but offering some information
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
that might help you make a decision on
 
04:04:54.769 --> 04:04:54.779 align:start position:0%
it as was mentioned in some prior
 
04:04:57.530 --> 04:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
testimony there have been some courts
 
04:04:59.929 --> 04:04:59.939 align:start position:0%
around the country that have opined on
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
this issue and what they say is that it
 
04:05:06.290 --> 04:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
is the parties that get to decide who
 
04:05:10.010 --> 04:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
participates in the Party primary
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh one of the reasons for that is to
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
keep a party in power from inflicting on
 
04:05:17.570 --> 04:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
the other party legislation that might
 
04:05:20.210 --> 04:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
determine who gets to participate in
 
04:05:23.269 --> 04:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
that party's primary so that's uh that's
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
not happening in this case but you know
 
04:05:26.689 --> 04:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
it it could under different
 
04:05:26.699 --> 04:05:28.510 align:start position:0%
it it could under different
circumstances

04:05:28.510 --> 04:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lane had mentioned that
 
04:05:34.570 --> 04:05:34.580 align:start position:0%
that position established by the courts
 
04:05:40.370 --> 04:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
is already in our Statute in RSA 659
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
colon 14 Roman numeral two and what that
 
04:05:48.590 --> 04:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
statute says basically is that uh if the
 
04:05:50.349 --> 04:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
party gives the Secretary of State
 
04:05:53.469 --> 04:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
notice well in advance of the election
 
04:05:57.170 --> 04:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
they can limit who participates uh in
 
04:05:58.969 --> 04:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
their primary not only limit but they
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
could open it up so both parties the
 
04:06:03.530 --> 04:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
Democratic party and the Republican
 
04:06:05.510 --> 04:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
Party New Hampshire both allow
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters to participate but
 
04:06:09.710 --> 04:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent the parties
 
04:06:11.809 --> 04:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
from saying you know the Republican
 
04:06:14.090 --> 04:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
Party could let Democrats participate
 
04:06:16.130 --> 04:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
also and vice versa
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh or they could tighten it up and just
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
say we only want members of our party to
 
04:06:26.090 --> 04:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
participate in our primary election
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
we also have a statute that says that on
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
the day before the filing period in June
 
04:06:34.130 --> 04:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
opens up
 
04:06:36.050 --> 04:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist have to
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
hold a session
 
04:06:37.560 --> 04:06:39.290 align:start position:0%
hold a session
or

04:06:39.290 --> 04:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
registered voters who belong to a
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
political party to be able to change
 
04:06:47.330 --> 04:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
their party affiliation either to the
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
other party or to Undeclared status
 
04:06:54.189 --> 04:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
and once that once that deadline goes by
 
04:06:58.130 --> 04:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
they are locked in to that status and
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
will hold that through the primary
 
04:06:59.640 --> 04:07:02.689 align:start position:0%
will hold that through the primary
election

04:07:02.689 --> 04:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
the other answer to a question that was
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
asked earlier about
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
what about a new voter that wants to
 
04:07:11.150 --> 04:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
register within that window between the
 
04:07:13.309 --> 04:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
filing period and the primary
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
if a new registration a brand new
 
04:07:19.250 --> 04:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
registration is received by the
 
04:07:21.170 --> 04:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist in a town
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
or city that voter gets to declare their
 
04:07:26.830 --> 04:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
party affiliation
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
on that registration and they are not
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
denied the right to vote because they're
 
04:07:34.610 --> 04:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
registering within that window
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh that's all I have to say Mr chairman
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
04:07:41.929 --> 04:07:41.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr secretary we are five
 
04:07:43.969 --> 04:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
minutes past the next hearing would it
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
be okay if members had questions that
 
04:07:46.849 --> 04:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
they send them to you directly
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ankerberg can you send up
 
04:08:13.729 --> 04:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:16.510 --> 04:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
gonna need that up here
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:41.520 --> 04:08:43.429 align:start position:0%
 
it's

04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:08:47.150 --> 04:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
so we had one sign in four one sign in
 
04:08:47.160 --> 04:08:49.309 align:start position:0%
so we had one sign in four one sign in
against

04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
against
 
04:08:51.290 --> 04:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh closes the public hearing on House
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:07.729 --> 04:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
hey there we go we'll open the public
 
04:09:09.769 --> 04:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 116. welcome
 
04:09:13.370 --> 04:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:15.650 --> 04:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
04:09:17.570 --> 04:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
members of house election law this is
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
the first time I am testifying to
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
election law uh not as a member of the
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee so uh uh fourth term and uh
 
04:09:26.210 --> 04:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
first term not on the committee of
 
04:09:28.729 --> 04:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
election law so uh thank you again for
 
04:09:30.170 --> 04:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to introduce House Bill
 
04:09:33.410 --> 04:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
116. relative to fees and primary
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
petitions required for primary ballot
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
election access
 
04:09:39.290 --> 04:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
the increase here might cause a bit of
 
04:09:41.210 --> 04:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
sticker shock to you understandably so
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
but I do want to stress the increases
 
04:09:46.189 --> 04:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
are only four campaigns running for the
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
United States Senate the United States
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
Congress and the office of Governor
 
04:09:52.610 --> 04:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
within the two registered political
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
parties no other position sees an
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
increase it is a privilege to be placed
 
04:10:00.110 --> 04:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
on the ballot for consideration by
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
irrespective political party in our
 
04:10:04.090 --> 04:10:04.100 align:start position:0%
state primary elections statistically
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
candidates vying for the Democrat or
 
04:10:08.990 --> 04:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
Republican nomination have a substantial
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
chance of winning their elections in our
 
04:10:13.370 --> 04:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
state and the privilege of party-based
 
04:10:15.290 --> 04:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
ballot access needs to be cognizant of
 
04:10:16.729 --> 04:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
this fact
 
04:10:18.769 --> 04:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
there will be no increase in this bill
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
for third party candidates to get on the
 
04:10:22.969 --> 04:10:22.979 align:start position:0%
general election ballot nor do we limit
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
the ability of someone to run a writing
 
04:10:27.170 --> 04:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
campaign if they are passionate about
 
04:10:28.849 --> 04:10:28.859 align:start position:0%
declaring themselves a candidate but
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
they miss either the financial or
 
04:10:33.950 --> 04:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
petition threshold set by this law you
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
may ask yourself why are we doing this
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
why are we submitting this legislation
 
04:10:41.210 --> 04:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
as one ambivalent and torn Observer on
 
04:10:43.490 --> 04:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
Twitter stated quite eloquently on the
 
04:10:45.410 --> 04:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
one hand it limits ability to run for
 
04:10:47.689 --> 04:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
high office on the other it limits
 
04:10:49.849 --> 04:10:49.859 align:start position:0%
ability to run for high office
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars or twenty five
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
thousand petitions made by members of
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
their party for Statewide office is a
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
fair barrier for the privilege of ballot
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
access for the United States Senate and
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
governor and fairly so the filing fee or
 
04:11:06.170 --> 04:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
number of signatures is cut in half to
 
04:11:08.450 --> 04:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
run for a seat in Congress for someone
 
04:11:10.969 --> 04:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
to be able to pay just a nominal fee or
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
submit a relative handful of petitions
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
and get their name printed on every
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
September primary ballot for their party
 
04:11:20.929 --> 04:11:20.939 align:start position:0%
detract from the process and only adds
 
04:11:22.610 --> 04:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
to voter confusion when they get to The
 
04:11:23.570 --> 04:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
Ballot Box
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
many will hear from anywhere from three
 
04:11:28.370 --> 04:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
to five candidates when they pay close
 
04:11:30.050 --> 04:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
attention to who is running in their
 
04:11:32.210 --> 04:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
respective party primaries for office
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
when they get to The Ballot Box they are
 
04:11:37.189 --> 04:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes surprised to see over a dozen
 
04:11:38.689 --> 04:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
names running for a high-level office
 
04:11:41.330 --> 04:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
after watching every debate television
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
ad and getting mail that only listed
 
04:11:45.769 --> 04:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
certain candidates to run successfully
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide or to be a member of Congress
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
for half our state one should be
 
04:11:52.670 --> 04:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
required to demonstrate a requisite base
 
04:11:54.889 --> 04:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
of support for their election by
 
04:11:57.170 --> 04:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
instituting a reasonable barrier whether
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
it be Financial or petition based we
 
04:12:01.969 --> 04:12:01.979 align:start position:0%
will require an individual to do one of
 
04:12:04.969 --> 04:12:04.979 align:start position:0%
three things likely they will raise the
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
campaign contributions to pay for the
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
filing fee
 
04:12:10.729 --> 04:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
compared to the cost of Television ads
 
04:12:13.250 --> 04:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
mailers digital ads and other means of
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
communications not to mention the
 
04:12:17.330 --> 04:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
Staffing and general operations of a
 
04:12:19.610 --> 04:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
campaign ten thousand dollars for a
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide office and five thousand
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
dollars for a congressional run is a
 
04:12:25.729 --> 04:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
fraction of what a competent and
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
competitive campaign is expected to
 
04:12:30.110 --> 04:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
spend another option would be the
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
candidate self-funding part or all of
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
the filing fee in order to get on the
 
04:12:37.370 --> 04:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
ballot as vain as we may consider some
 
04:12:39.650 --> 04:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
candidates to be running for office is
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
not a vanity project and I highly doubt
 
04:12:43.610 --> 04:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
anyone would be vain enough to spend
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
such a shum such a sum without putting
 
04:12:48.290 --> 04:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
together an equally impressive campaign
 
04:12:50.809 --> 04:12:50.819 align:start position:0%
operation that showcases a serious
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
candidate who is dedicated to the idea
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
of actually serving in this the office
 
04:12:56.570 --> 04:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
that they're running for
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
thirdly the candidate has the ability to
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
collect signatures and have their team
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
collect signatures to get on the ballot
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
this is actually the option I would
 
04:13:07.969 --> 04:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
recommend to a U.S Senate gubernatorial
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
or Congressional Campaign to pursue it
 
04:13:12.830 --> 04:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
gives them a list of 25
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
000 plus Granite Staters in their party
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
willing to get them on the ballot and
 
04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
would require them to build a campaign
 
04:13:21.650 --> 04:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
operation Operation that stretches
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the state to some broad
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
appeal not just to party activists but
 
04:13:27.530 --> 04:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
to rank and file members of their
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
respective parties that are not obsessed
 
04:13:32.750 --> 04:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
with our political culture 24 7. such a
 
04:13:34.610 --> 04:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
campaign and requirement for elected
 
04:13:37.010 --> 04:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
office would force candidates to reach
 
04:13:39.410 --> 04:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
out and appeal to voters not just in the
 
04:13:41.809 --> 04:13:41.819 align:start position:0%
weeks before a primary election but in
 
04:13:43.570 --> 04:13:43.580 align:start position:0%
the months before candidate filing
 
04:13:45.889 --> 04:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
one-on-one getting signatures and
 
04:13:47.150 --> 04:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
building a campaign team and
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
organization capable of such a task
 
04:13:53.150 --> 04:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions and I
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
really do want to stress as with any
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that we consider and
 
04:13:58.189 --> 04:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
typically the legislation that I like to
 
04:14:00.830 --> 04:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
file uh the sponsorship team in my and I
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
are more than happy to have as many
 
04:14:04.849 --> 04:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
conversation as it takes to work on this
 
04:14:07.130 --> 04:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
legislation and get a bill or a version
 
04:14:09.349 --> 04:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
of this bill across the Finish Line this
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
term so we can strengthen our primary
 
04:14:13.849 --> 04:14:13.859 align:start position:0%
ballot access process and I believe make
 
04:14:15.290 --> 04:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
our election process in New Hampshire
 
04:14:18.170 --> 04:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
greater for it thank you for the time
 
04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative boehm
 
04:14:24.410 --> 04:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:14:25.969 --> 04:14:25.979 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:14:25.979 --> 04:14:26.570 align:start position:0%
taking the question
um

04:14:26.570 --> 04:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
I have more concerned with the
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
presidential where people can file for
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
hardly anything but the problem is
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better than
 
04:14:37.370 --> 04:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
you can spend this amount of money or
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
file for this amount of money and then
 
04:14:42.349 --> 04:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
if you get a certain percentage of the
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
vote you can get money back what do you
 
04:14:47.090 --> 04:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
think of that idea
 
04:14:49.070 --> 04:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
I would I personally would be opposed to
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
it I actually think we heard testimony
 
04:14:53.330 --> 04:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
in the previous uh Bill hearing uh
 
04:14:55.010 --> 04:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
talking about the state funding these
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
elections and I actually think a great
 
04:14:58.729 --> 04:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
solution to that is having the
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
candidates running for high office in
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
both parties essentially funding the
 
04:15:04.729 --> 04:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
cost of printing ballots for the primary
 
04:15:06.410 --> 04:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
elections which I think based on the
 
04:15:08.689 --> 04:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal note this bill would in effect do
 
04:15:10.969 --> 04:15:10.979 align:start position:0%
not knowing the exact specific numbers
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
on the cost for September primary ballot
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
printing but it does in my assessment it
 
04:15:17.809 --> 04:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
should stay with the state to help cover
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of getting their name in every
 
04:15:19.920 --> 04:15:23.389 align:start position:0%
the cost of getting their name in every
town

04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:25.370 --> 04:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
04:15:28.490 --> 04:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh So speaking of
 
04:15:30.889 --> 04:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note uh in the fiscal note it
 
04:15:33.889 --> 04:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
States in the year 2024 and the fiscal
 
04:15:36.290 --> 04:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
year for 2026 that the state revenue
 
04:15:40.370 --> 04:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
would be 301 950 dollars
 
04:15:43.929 --> 04:15:43.939 align:start position:0%
now that is a sum that is made up of
 
04:15:46.490 --> 04:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
upwards of 40 candidates as you have
 
04:15:49.370 --> 04:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
listed here uh seven of which uh running
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
for governor 14 running for Senate 19
 
04:15:55.250 --> 04:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
running for congress is this something
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we can expect year after year and
 
04:16:00.889 --> 04:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
if so this seems like a high number uh
 
04:16:03.410 --> 04:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
to be saying that we should count on uh
 
04:16:04.910 --> 04:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
for every single election
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
question uh I was not uh involved in
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
ols's construction of the fiscal note
 
04:16:12.170 --> 04:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
with LBA
 
04:16:13.370 --> 04:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
um I believe they based off their
 
04:16:14.689 --> 04:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
numbers off Consulting with the
 
04:16:16.610 --> 04:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State for historic trends
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
for candidates that do run for office on
 
04:16:20.570 --> 04:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle
 
04:16:22.130 --> 04:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
um and those were their projections for
 
04:16:25.370 --> 04:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
2024 filing in 2026 filing we could very
 
04:16:27.410 --> 04:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
well have 12 Republicans and 12
 
04:16:30.050 --> 04:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
Democrats Run for the next U.S Senate
 
04:16:31.969 --> 04:16:31.979 align:start position:0%
race in 2026 or the next open
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial race where there's an Open
 
04:16:36.830 --> 04:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
Primary on both sides uh again I the the
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that's included wasn't part
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
of my piece of legislation it's attached
 
04:16:43.729 --> 04:16:43.739 align:start position:0%
to the bill as what the Secretary of
 
04:16:46.490 --> 04:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
State working with LBA advised would be
 
04:16:49.490 --> 04:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
a likely or potential fiscal note uh
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
impact for the bill
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so for my follow-up
 
04:16:57.769 --> 04:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
question uh the cost to run for
 
04:17:00.530 --> 04:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
president uh for filing is a thousand
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
dollars now this would make it so that
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
the cost to run for governor is 10 times
 
04:17:07.250 --> 04:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
that of what it would be to run for
 
04:17:07.260 --> 04:17:08.870 align:start position:0%
that of what it would be to run for
president

04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
president
 
04:17:11.210 --> 04:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts on why that
 
04:17:12.830 --> 04:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
number was chosen
 
04:17:15.170 --> 04:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
uh the presidential primary on both
 
04:17:17.090 --> 04:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
sides that a thousand dollars still sees
 
04:17:20.689 --> 04:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
30 to 40 people even file uh for the
 
04:17:22.849 --> 04:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
Republican and Democrat primary whether
 
04:17:25.490 --> 04:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
there's an incumbent president or not
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
um I with this legislation it was
 
04:17:29.689 --> 04:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
focused on the September primary I think
 
04:17:31.130 --> 04:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
there is a bit of a different
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
distinction between the presidential
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
preference primary that we engage in
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
um for the state as first in the nation
 
04:17:40.969 --> 04:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
primary and the state primary that
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
elects our state's elected officials
 
04:17:45.170 --> 04:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
um so that's where I would draw the line
 
04:17:49.130 --> 04:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.370 --> 04:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you
 
04:17:57.170 --> 04:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't see it
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
God representative Brennan thank you one
 
04:18:03.170 --> 04:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
of the Prime bipartisan Arguments for
 
04:18:04.969 --> 04:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
maintaining New Hampshire's first in the
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
nation status
 
04:18:09.530 --> 04:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
um is that anyone can succeed in New
 
04:18:12.349 --> 04:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anyone yeah so am I
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
understanding this proposal correctly to
 
04:18:18.170 --> 04:18:18.180 align:start position:0%
say that one must have a war chest or a
 
04:18:20.330 --> 04:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
complete campaign organization in order
 
04:18:22.729 --> 04:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
to just file
 
04:18:26.150 --> 04:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
one one in June or or whenever the
 
04:18:28.849 --> 04:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
filing period is has to demonstrate the
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
ability uh if they're running for
 
04:18:32.809 --> 04:18:32.819 align:start position:0%
governor U.S senate or congress that
 
04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
they either have raised the funds
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
necessary to file to get on the ballot
 
04:18:38.090 --> 04:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
or they have a campaign operation and
 
04:18:40.010 --> 04:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
Grassroots support to support them
 
04:18:41.870 --> 04:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
getting on the ballot as well it doesn't
 
04:18:44.210 --> 04:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
limit who can do it we could still have
 
04:18:46.969 --> 04:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
10 people running in a primary we could
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
still have 20 people running in a
 
04:18:51.170 --> 04:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
primary they would just have to put the
 
04:18:53.689 --> 04:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
effort in to get on to the privilege of
 
04:18:56.570 --> 04:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
being on the ballot we keep the fees for
 
04:18:59.090 --> 04:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
executive Council and state senate the
 
04:19:01.070 --> 04:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
same uh and and currently it drafted in
 
04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
the bill we actually zeroed out the
 
04:19:05.090 --> 04:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
state representative fee
 
04:19:06.769 --> 04:19:06.779 align:start position:0%
um and and I believe originally we
 
04:19:08.330 --> 04:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
intended it to make it so that state
 
04:19:10.010 --> 04:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative candidates would be
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
required to get five signatures from
 
04:19:14.570 --> 04:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
their neighbors in order to get on the
 
04:19:16.670 --> 04:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
ballot but I don't know if that actually
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
made it into the OLS draft so I'm not
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to commit to that version of the
 
04:19:23.210 --> 04:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
bill at this at this time but that I was
 
04:19:25.130 --> 04:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
I will say the original intent when we
 
04:19:28.130 --> 04:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
were drafting the legislation but but
 
04:19:30.650 --> 04:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
for the races of Governor U.S Senate and
 
04:19:30.660 --> 04:19:32.150 align:start position:0%
for the races of Governor U.S Senate and
Congress

04:19:32.150 --> 04:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
um a reasonable threshold is put in
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.729 --> 04:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:19:42.889 --> 04:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
04:19:47.110 --> 04:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
um representative Sweeney can you
 
04:19:50.990 --> 04:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
tell me how the the number 5000 and the
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
number 10 000 were chosen and then again
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
why the number for the petitions was
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
chosen so I can say for for the
 
04:20:01.610 --> 04:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
Congressional races five thousand and uh
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
12 500 petitions we just cut in half the
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
ten thousand and twenty five thousand uh
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
and When approaching ten thousand and
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand uh ten thousand is
 
04:20:14.450 --> 04:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
currently the the maximum individual
 
04:20:17.809 --> 04:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
donation a uh individual can give to a
 
04:20:19.729 --> 04:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial campaign for the
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
pre-filing and then the prime uh primary
 
04:20:26.929 --> 04:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
um period in the in state law so outside
 
04:20:29.210 --> 04:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
of an individual giving them money
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
outside of them a candidate giving their
 
04:20:33.530 --> 04:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
own campaign an unlimited amount of
 
04:20:35.809 --> 04:20:35.819 align:start position:0%
money uh they can collect five thousand
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
in pre-filing and then five thousand for
 
04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
the primary election so that's how we
 
04:20:42.530 --> 04:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
came to that ten thousand number but
 
04:20:44.750 --> 04:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
like I said again we're open to having
 
04:20:47.030 --> 04:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
the conversation on the specific number
 
04:20:48.650 --> 04:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
that we want to land out for this
 
04:20:51.769 --> 04:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
legislation but logistically and then
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
once we had that set for governor it
 
04:20:54.830 --> 04:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
made sense with the same number of
 
04:20:56.510 --> 04:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
ballots being printed for U.S Senate
 
04:20:58.490 --> 04:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
that we would make it 10 000 as well
 
04:21:03.650 --> 04:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sweeney thank
 
04:21:08.399 --> 04:21:11.269 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sweeney thank
you

04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.010 --> 04:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.170 --> 04:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so my name
 
04:21:31.969 --> 04:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
is Timothy Horrigan a reverend Stratford
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
County District six
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
um actually it's now District 10. even
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
though my old name takes as otherwise so
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of Durham town of
 
04:21:39.960 --> 04:21:40.910 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of Durham town of
Durham

04:21:40.910 --> 04:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
and I do some written testimony which I
 
04:21:44.929 --> 04:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
wrote up well before I heard
 
04:21:47.110 --> 04:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative I guess the member from
 
04:21:50.570 --> 04:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
Manchester's testimony and um not that
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
it changed my mind in fact actually I
 
04:21:53.809 --> 04:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
think I'm even more opposed to the bill
 
04:21:55.370 --> 04:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
because he pointed out something that
 
04:21:57.710 --> 04:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
escaped my notice or I didn't think much
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
about which was uh this doesn't
 
04:22:03.170 --> 04:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
do anything to make it easier or harder
 
04:22:05.090 --> 04:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
for people to run as third-party
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
candidates and I assume that probably
 
04:22:09.950 --> 04:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
the intended effect of this
 
04:22:11.630 --> 04:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
I guess not that I'm supposed to impune
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
motives but I'm inferring that the
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
effect of this bill if we pass would
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
probably be encouraged a lot more uh
 
04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
insurgents to run outside the party
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
structure as third party candidates and
 
04:22:23.689 --> 04:22:23.699 align:start position:0%
that probably has good points and bad
 
04:22:25.490 --> 04:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
points but I'm personally not in favor
 
04:22:28.490 --> 04:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
of it um so should I hand this around it
 
04:22:30.170 --> 04:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
is I did submit to the website but I
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't really know where any of that
 
04:22:34.729 --> 04:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
those files are going this year because
 
04:22:37.010 --> 04:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
the last time we had that procedure you
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
could look them up on the website but
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
now they're just sort of
 
04:22:42.050 --> 04:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
they're going somewhere but I don't know
 
04:22:42.060 --> 04:22:45.170 align:start position:0%
they're going somewhere but I don't know
where

04:22:45.170 --> 04:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:58.130 --> 04:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
sorry my Preamble is probably longer
 
04:22:59.689 --> 04:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
than it needed to be but I'll just say
 
04:23:02.090 --> 04:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
I've there's four main points
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
or maybe it's five but my first point is
 
04:23:04.560 --> 04:23:05.750 align:start position:0%
or maybe it's five but my first point is
simply

04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
simply
 
04:23:08.170 --> 04:23:08.180 align:start position:0%
as we've already heard
 
04:23:12.050 --> 04:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
hb116 raises a tax or fee
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
although they occasionally make
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
exceptions one of the core values of the
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
house Republican caucus is that no state
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
tax or fee should ever be raised for any
 
04:23:21.729 --> 04:23:21.739 align:start position:0%
reason even by a small amount and even
 
04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
on my side the Democratic uh we're
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
usually pretty reluctant to raise taxes
 
04:23:28.849 --> 04:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
or fees if there isn't a good reason for
 
04:23:31.309 --> 04:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
it and um I don't think there's a good
 
04:23:33.110 --> 04:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
reason for it I don't think the reason
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
that I heard qualifies as a good reason
 
04:23:36.889 --> 04:23:36.899 align:start position:0%
and it's not just a small amount as I
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
said ten thousand percent which is
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
um it does lower the State Rep fee from
 
04:23:45.110 --> 04:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
two dollars to zero which that's a
 
04:23:46.490 --> 04:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
pretty minuscule fee it doesn't make
 
04:23:47.870 --> 04:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
much difference one way or the other it
 
04:23:49.370 --> 04:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
does downshift
 
04:23:52.189 --> 04:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
a few dollars of cost down to the town
 
04:23:54.050 --> 04:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
clerk's office since unlike the other
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
offices we stay rep register at the Town
 
04:23:59.090 --> 04:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
Hall not at the Secretary of State's
 
04:24:00.830 --> 04:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
office but
 
04:24:00.840 --> 04:24:01.969 align:start position:0%
office but
um

04:24:01.969 --> 04:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:04.490 --> 04:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
thirdly and I think this is probably
 
04:24:05.929 --> 04:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
born after the testimony we've already
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
heard they're high enough to discourage
 
04:24:09.410 --> 04:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
lesser known candidates who've not
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
raised much money before the campaign
 
04:24:13.849 --> 04:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
and this definitely would be a barrier
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
to entry for candidates of modest means
 
04:24:17.450 --> 04:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
some of which have actually won in the
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
past not just in the primaries but
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes the general election
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
now we have had a few overcrowded
 
04:24:25.490 --> 04:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
primaries with an article excessive
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
number of weaker candidates in the
 
04:24:29.090 --> 04:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
ballots but those primaries you know
 
04:24:31.130 --> 04:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
haven't resulted in Weak nominees you
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
know we've had a
 
04:24:34.429 --> 04:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
strong nominees have come out of crowded
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
primaries uh we've had weak nominees
 
04:24:38.750 --> 04:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
have come out of primaries with only two
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
or only one candidate
 
04:24:43.610 --> 04:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
and anyway the huge proposed fee
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
increases aren't going to keep we'll
 
04:24:47.450 --> 04:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
only keep poor fools from running they
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
won't dissuade Rich fools um
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
if HB 116 passes uh candidate should
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
also I think they've effectively denied
 
04:24:56.809 --> 04:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
the alternative of gathering petitions
 
04:24:58.610 --> 04:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
in lieu of paying a filing fee at least
 
04:24:59.929 --> 04:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
for those uh
 
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
top of the ballot offices
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
and I guess we heard that they have to
 
04:25:07.550 --> 04:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
collect a gubernatorial senatorial
 
04:25:09.349 --> 04:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
candidates right now they only need to
 
04:25:11.570 --> 04:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
bring in 200 they're going to have to
 
04:25:13.010 --> 04:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
bring in 25
 
04:25:13.020 --> 04:25:14.030 align:start position:0%
bring in 25
000.

04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
000.
 
04:25:15.650 --> 04:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
and they said it like it's a good thing
 
04:25:17.389 --> 04:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
that the party would now have a list of
 
04:25:17.399 --> 04:25:18.349 align:start position:0%
that the party would now have a list of
25

04:25:18.349 --> 04:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
25
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
000 people who pledged to a candidate
 
04:25:22.250 --> 04:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
04:25:24.110 --> 04:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
probably sometimes good but that also
 
04:25:26.809 --> 04:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
discourages in my opinion uh
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
um Insurgent candidates you know like we
 
04:25:29.699 --> 04:25:30.410 align:start position:0%
um Insurgent candidates you know like we
had

04:25:30.410 --> 04:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:25:30.420 --> 04:25:31.429 align:start position:0%
had
um

04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
like any like governor sununu for the
 
04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
first time has had a serious uh a couple
 
04:25:38.210 --> 04:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
of serious opponents and they actually
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
got a lot less than uh ten thousand uh
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
25 000 votes the the more successful the
 
04:25:47.689 --> 04:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
two got about ten thousand but it would
 
04:25:48.769 --> 04:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
have been even harder for those
 
04:25:50.570 --> 04:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
candidates to get their campaigns going
 
04:25:52.610 --> 04:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
if they were like if they'd have to
 
04:25:54.830 --> 04:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
submit 25 000 name sheltered for the
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
state committee for them to look
 
04:25:58.370 --> 04:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
um so they could
 
04:26:01.370 --> 04:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
and um congressional candidates 12 500
 
04:26:03.229 --> 04:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
700 that's a twelve thousand five
 
04:26:04.849 --> 04:26:04.859 align:start position:0%
hundred percent increase and that's
 
04:26:07.969 --> 04:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
greatly uh increased the the cost of a
 
04:26:09.889 --> 04:26:09.899 align:start position:0%
cost of Entry
 
04:26:11.450 --> 04:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
and those are very large numbers
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
compared to the north people vote in the
 
04:26:14.590 --> 04:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
primary like uh
 
04:26:18.110 --> 04:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
147 501 voted in the Republican primary
 
04:26:23.330 --> 04:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
in 2022 96 275 so that's like a pretty
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
high percentage of the people who
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
participate in these primaries and um
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
and so uh and finally we're talking
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
about the amount of money it doesn't
 
04:26:33.530 --> 04:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
really raise such a different amount of
 
04:26:33.540 --> 04:26:34.370 align:start position:0%
really raise such a different amount of
money

04:26:34.370 --> 04:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:26:36.290 --> 04:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
um even if no fringe candidates are
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
discouraged from running in 2024 if we
 
04:26:41.149 --> 04:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
pass HB 116. it's only going to raise
 
04:26:43.969 --> 04:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
about three hundred thousand dollars um
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
I think there's better places than the
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
state budget look for 300 000 and it was
 
04:26:47.880 --> 04:26:48.830 align:start position:0%
state budget look for 300 000 and it was
uh

04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
was represented that this would help
 
04:26:52.370 --> 04:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
these candidates pay for the costs of
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
printing up the ballots and the work the
 
04:26:55.610 --> 04:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
secretary of state does which is uh
 
04:26:57.950 --> 04:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
significant but um
 
04:27:00.889 --> 04:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
this money is earmarked for the general
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
fund so it's not earmarked for the
 
04:27:04.550 --> 04:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office anyway so
 
04:27:06.410 --> 04:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
this is an unnecessary
 
04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
um unnecessary Bill and uh as with the
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
other one I would certainly urge you to
 
04:27:11.640 --> 04:27:14.830 align:start position:0%
other one I would certainly urge you to
uh

04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:18.050 --> 04:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
your first opportunity there is
 
04:27:20.450 --> 04:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
one small issue it bugs me which is kind
 
04:27:21.830 --> 04:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
of mentioned in passing the bill which
 
04:27:24.170 --> 04:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
talk about electing delegates the
 
04:27:26.330 --> 04:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
Democratic party election delegates it
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh downtown conventions Republicans have
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
it on the ballot and I think
 
04:27:35.389 --> 04:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
I think it would be a maybe maybe sounds
 
04:27:37.309 --> 04:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
more small deep Democratic select among
 
04:27:38.570 --> 04:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
the ballots but that that's a
 
04:27:40.189 --> 04:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
substantial cost to the state like
 
04:27:41.570 --> 04:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
because there's lots of write-ins a lot
 
04:27:44.210 --> 04:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
of people lots of uh candidates people
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't know so it might it might actually
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
be more fair to for the Republicans to
 
04:27:50.450 --> 04:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
also elect them the same way at the
 
04:27:53.689 --> 04:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
local Town conventions but that's uh
 
04:27:56.570 --> 04:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's a minor point but anyway so
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions if
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
anyone has has anyone
 
04:28:04.189 --> 04:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:04.199 --> 04:28:06.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

04:28:06.110 --> 04:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:28:07.849 --> 04:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative yes I
 
04:28:09.410 --> 04:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
will I'd also miss like every year I'd
 
04:28:10.729 --> 04:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
like to get a two dollar bill from the
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
bank so I always enjoy bringing in a two
 
04:28:14.269 --> 04:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
dollar bill to the town clerk's office
 
04:28:16.130 --> 04:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't have to I wouldn't be
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
able to do that anymore but all right
 
04:28:23.210 --> 04:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.130 --> 04:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.140 --> 04:28:38.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:28:38.990 --> 04:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:40.849 --> 04:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:28:43.729 --> 04:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
committee I'm rise in opposition to
 
04:28:47.210 --> 04:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
house bill 116. this bill drastically
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
increases the fees for running for the
 
04:28:51.950 --> 04:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
top three offices in New Hampshire this
 
04:28:53.570 --> 04:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
is not an increase that matches
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
inflation and it appears to designed to
 
04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
favor Rich candidates that may not be
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
the intent but it gives that appearance
 
04:29:05.269 --> 04:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
a hundred times increased I feel is
 
04:29:05.279 --> 04:29:07.010 align:start position:0%
a hundred times increased I feel is
unreasonable

04:29:07.010 --> 04:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
the alternative filing by nomination
 
04:29:12.290 --> 04:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
papers now will require a large team of
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
petitioners to gather this large number
 
04:29:19.309 --> 04:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
a huge number of petitions uh within the
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
approximately three-month time period
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
that it's needed to get them in
 
04:29:27.250 --> 04:29:27.260 align:start position:0%
this also puts a huge burden on local
 
04:29:29.689 --> 04:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
supervisors the checklist because they
 
04:29:32.510 --> 04:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
are the ones that have to verify such
 
04:29:32.520 --> 04:29:34.250 align:start position:0%
are the ones that have to verify such
petitions

04:29:34.250 --> 04:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
petitions
 
04:29:34.260 --> 04:29:36.710 align:start position:0%
petitions
uh

04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
this bill also does not present a good
 
04:29:42.410 --> 04:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
optic for New Hampshire by making it
 
04:29:44.149 --> 04:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
more difficult for candidates to get on
 
04:29:46.250 --> 04:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
the ballot and thus reducing the choices
 
04:29:48.469 --> 04:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
for voters
 
04:29:50.570 --> 04:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
removing the two dollar fee from state
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
representative candidates does not
 
04:29:54.769 --> 04:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
remove any significant barrier to
 
04:29:57.530 --> 04:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
becoming a candidate and deprives the
 
04:29:59.630 --> 04:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
local community of even covering
 
04:30:01.790 --> 04:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
photocopy costs for registering the
 
04:30:01.800 --> 04:30:02.809 align:start position:0%
photocopy costs for registering the
candidate

04:30:02.809 --> 04:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
04:30:06.290 --> 04:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
I urge is committee to itl this bill
 
04:30:08.570 --> 04:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll take any questions if
 
04:30:09.769 --> 04:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
04:30:18.170 --> 04:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I am Sam boy and I spoke
 
04:30:33.469 --> 04:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
previously Ira or stand today in
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill for the basic
 
04:30:37.969 --> 04:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
and fundamental reasons that this is
 
04:30:41.090 --> 04:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
about ballot access there the reason
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
stated for adding the fees is that the
 
04:30:46.010 --> 04:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
problem is that there are too many names
 
04:30:47.570 --> 04:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot of names for people to
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
look at and we print a lot of paper and
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
the terms of there's a lot of names I
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
believe if you are going to go and
 
04:30:55.250 --> 04:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to vote for the governor or
 
04:30:56.809 --> 04:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
senate or presidential race you will
 
04:30:58.250 --> 04:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
have done your research ahead of time
 
04:31:00.769 --> 04:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
and you can find a name and dare you
 
04:31:02.210 --> 04:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
have to look at 20 names you will be
 
04:31:03.649 --> 04:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
able to select the candidate that you
 
04:31:05.809 --> 04:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
wanted the odds that somebody will be
 
04:31:07.849 --> 04:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
making a decision in The Ballot Box
 
04:31:09.530 --> 04:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
having Google 20 names who they have
 
04:31:11.870 --> 04:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
never heard of is an unlikely one and on
 
04:31:13.610 --> 04:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
the second point of the cost of printing
 
04:31:15.410 --> 04:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
paper there are more effective ways to
 
04:31:17.570 --> 04:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
either cut funding from other measures
 
04:31:20.149 --> 04:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
or raise small amounts of taxes if
 
04:31:22.729 --> 04:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
printing paper is truly the reason for
 
04:31:24.050 --> 04:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
the fee increases
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
at a fundamental level putting up
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
another barrier to obstructing people's
 
04:31:30.590 --> 04:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
ability to get on the ballot is not a
 
04:31:32.269 --> 04:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
good one for the health or the viability
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
long term of our democracy if somebody
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
wants to run for their ego or they want
 
04:31:39.889 --> 04:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
to run because they are vain so what
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
they get on the ballot that's okay but
 
04:31:43.490 --> 04:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
if somebody legitimately wants to have
 
04:31:46.370 --> 04:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
an upstart Insurgency candidacy and they
 
04:31:48.290 --> 04:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
don't have the funding or the support I
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
believe in America and in New Hampshire
 
04:31:51.889 --> 04:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
they ought to have a shot to be able to
 
04:31:54.530 --> 04:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
do that there are no harms to us as
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
Citizens representatives of this state
 
04:31:58.490 --> 04:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
that there will be another name on the
 
04:32:02.210 --> 04:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
ballot and that we will have to spend a
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
tenth of a penny printing their name in
 
04:32:06.170 --> 04:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
ink I urge you to vote against this bill
 
04:32:08.570 --> 04:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
because in a because again going back to
 
04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
the Ronald Raven quote government is not
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
the problem government is this
 
04:32:13.130 --> 04:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
government is not the solution
 
04:32:15.170 --> 04:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
government is the problem there does not
 
04:32:16.670 --> 04:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
need to be an added or increased
 
04:32:18.050 --> 04:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
restriction in preventing people's
 
04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
access to the ballot and their ability
 
04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
to vote thank you
 
04:32:24.649 --> 04:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:40.570 --> 04:32:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.309 --> 04:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
Stephen Born Ryan Hampshire thank you
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
very much I'm opposed to this bill for a
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
number of reasons and believe it or not
 
04:32:48.530 --> 04:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
there is one part that I actually do
 
04:32:50.570 --> 04:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
like that I'll tell you about
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um we as speaking for Undeclared voters
 
04:32:55.790 --> 04:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not nominated to speak for all of
 
04:32:57.710 --> 04:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
them but as one we would like more
 
04:33:01.269 --> 04:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
choices this would give us less choices
 
04:33:04.730 --> 04:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
also if you have the same sort of people
 
04:33:06.529 --> 04:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
running all the time you get the same
 
04:33:06.539 --> 04:33:07.789 align:start position:0%
running all the time you get the same
ideas

04:33:07.789 --> 04:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
all right having easy ballot access
 
04:33:11.390 --> 04:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that run they're
 
04:33:15.051 --> 04:33:15.061 align:start position:0%
one-trick ponies they want to give one
 
04:33:17.810 --> 04:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
idea or platform to talk about this
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
would make that harder so we wouldn't
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
get maybe those ingenious ideas the
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
things that really none of us have
 
04:33:26.570 --> 04:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
thought about yet but really move the
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
needle so this would limit the health
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
all right it's how you um Evolution
 
04:33:35.449 --> 04:33:35.459 align:start position:0%
fails when you do these kind of things
 
04:33:37.609 --> 04:33:37.619 align:start position:0%
um the second problem is that the smarts
 
04:33:41.209 --> 04:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
of this vote this measure
 
04:33:44.209 --> 04:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
equated seriousness to money
 
04:33:46.609 --> 04:33:46.619 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a misnomer and it's a
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
problem one of the biggest things
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
driving some of the dysfunction and the
 
04:33:53.090 --> 04:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
way are we manage our Republic is all of
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
the money now I happen to be an
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voter so I get all this
 
04:33:58.849 --> 04:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
lovely mail from both sides it's gross
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
how much money from out of state pours
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
in to tell me what I should be doing so
 
04:34:06.590 --> 04:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
money's not good also the other speaker
 
04:34:06.600 --> 04:34:07.789 align:start position:0%
money's not good also the other speaker
mentioned

04:34:07.789 --> 04:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know some of the people the most
 
04:34:11.810 --> 04:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
money are the scariest they may not be
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
the people that we want on our ballot
 
04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
maybe these people with some ideas
 
04:34:18.769 --> 04:34:18.779 align:start position:0%
on to petitions
 
04:34:20.929 --> 04:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
um who here has gone out and collected a
 
04:34:22.970 --> 04:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
bunch of petitions
 
04:34:24.769 --> 04:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
to run for office am I the only one here
 
04:34:26.929 --> 04:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
that's gone out and done that and
 
04:34:28.490 --> 04:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
collected petitions to get on the ballot
 
04:34:28.500 --> 04:34:30.410 align:start position:0%
collected petitions to get on the ballot
okay

04:34:30.410 --> 04:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:30.420 --> 04:34:31.429 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
as the one person's done it probably is
 
04:34:35.631 --> 04:34:35.641 align:start position:0%
learned it's not that easy
 
04:34:39.051 --> 04:34:39.061 align:start position:0%
okay it's pretty difficult you'd be
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
amazed people don't even know where they
 
04:34:40.799 --> 04:34:41.750 align:start position:0%
amazed people don't even know where they
vote

04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
you have to get in the people do you
 
04:34:46.250 --> 04:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
know where the current political climate
 
04:34:49.010 --> 04:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
do you know how receptive people are to
 
04:34:52.250 --> 04:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
talk to you and do that it's not easy
 
04:34:54.769 --> 04:34:54.779 align:start position:0%
all right this is a really high barrier
 
04:34:57.769 --> 04:34:57.779 align:start position:0%
it can be done groups have come in and
 
04:34:59.330 --> 04:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
collected tons of signatures in New
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know how they do it
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
outside money
 
04:35:05.689 --> 04:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
they bring in a ton of people they pay
 
04:35:07.970 --> 04:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
people and they get it done it's not New
 
04:35:09.051 --> 04:35:09.061 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people going out and
 
04:35:10.189 --> 04:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
collecting seniors just for New
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people it's other people's
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
money putting candidates to tell us what
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to do
 
04:35:16.439 --> 04:35:16.970 align:start position:0%
we're going to do
um

04:35:16.970 --> 04:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
it and anybody we have one person that
 
04:35:21.890 --> 04:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
knows the process of collecting a
 
04:35:24.529 --> 04:35:24.539 align:start position:0%
signature petition not only do you have
 
04:35:26.330 --> 04:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
to convince the person to sign this
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
petition explain this to them
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
then you have to especially if you have
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
to organize them
 
04:35:36.410 --> 04:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
all right by where they voted guess how
 
04:35:38.689 --> 04:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
many people know their Ward number not
 
04:35:38.699 --> 04:35:39.709 align:start position:0%
many people know their Ward number not
many

04:35:39.709 --> 04:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
many
 
04:35:41.631 --> 04:35:41.641 align:start position:0%
okay they know where to go but they
 
04:35:43.189 --> 04:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't know the ward number
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
you have to organize them by that then
 
04:35:47.209 --> 04:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
you have to go to the town hall the city
 
04:35:49.910 --> 04:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
clerk and find the supervisor the
 
04:35:53.150 --> 04:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
checklist two supervisors the checklist
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
have to look at each petition
 
04:35:59.689 --> 04:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
okay and sign it off together so you
 
04:36:03.051 --> 04:36:03.061 align:start position:0%
have created a huge amount of work for
 
04:36:05.150 --> 04:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
the sex supervisors the checklist now if
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
you hold that position you know that
 
04:36:08.689 --> 04:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
it's not a very highly paid position
 
04:36:11.631 --> 04:36:11.641 align:start position:0%
it's volunteer so you're creating a huge
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
amount of work for that
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
um just out of curiosity if you wanted
 
04:36:18.170 --> 04:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
to get an independent party on the
 
04:36:19.609 --> 04:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
ballot in New Hampshire anyone I want to
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
take a guess of How High that stack of
 
04:36:22.970 --> 04:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
petitions need to be
 
04:36:25.010 --> 04:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
to get an independent party on through
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
the petition process
 
04:36:30.650 --> 04:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
no how about 10 feet
 
04:36:32.810 --> 04:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
you stacked all those petitions on top
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
that would be now
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
there is actually one good thing that
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
could come out of this bill from my
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
perspective is that if this bill does
 
04:36:42.480 --> 04:36:44.150 align:start position:0%
perspective is that if this bill does
pass

04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
um it could lead to The Disappearance of
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
the Republican and Democratic party and
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
I would support that
 
04:36:50.570 --> 04:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
do you know why
 
04:36:52.730 --> 04:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
because to maintain your status of the
 
04:36:52.740 --> 04:36:53.810 align:start position:0%
because to maintain your status of the
party

04:36:53.810 --> 04:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
party
 
04:36:56.330 --> 04:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
the Republican and Democratic party need
 
04:36:59.570 --> 04:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
to get on at least one candidate on a
 
04:36:59.580 --> 04:37:01.070 align:start position:0%
to get on at least one candidate on a
Statewide

04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
04:37:02.810 --> 04:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
all right office and there's only three
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
of them the two Senate seats and the
 
04:37:07.810 --> 04:37:07.820 align:start position:0%
governor's office and every you know
 
04:37:10.131 --> 04:37:10.141 align:start position:0%
there's only you know out of the six
 
04:37:11.570 --> 04:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
years there's one year where there's
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
only the governor that runs so let's say
 
04:37:16.609 --> 04:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
the Republicans are Democrats can't come
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
up with somebody to Fork up the twenty
 
04:37:20.689 --> 04:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars and come up this
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
in they don't have a candidate on the
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
ballot guess what happens to that party
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
next year
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
bye bye and then you're with me
 
04:37:31.970 --> 04:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
collecting 10 feet of petitions or
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get somebody to run for one of
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
those office in the next election cycle
 
04:37:37.369 --> 04:37:37.379 align:start position:0%
to try to get them up ready so I just
 
04:37:39.890 --> 04:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
thought I should point that out to you
 
04:37:42.769 --> 04:37:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.131 --> 04:37:46.141 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
04:37:52.609 --> 04:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:00.670 --> 04:38:00.680 align:start position:0%

04:38:08.090 --> 04:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
only real interest in this bill is the
 
04:38:11.269 --> 04:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
fact that currently when you file for
 
04:38:13.730 --> 04:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
State Rep the two dollars that your
 
04:38:16.490 --> 04:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
filing fee is is kept at the Town level
 
04:38:18.769 --> 04:38:18.779 align:start position:0%
so we vigorously defend all revenue
 
04:38:21.289 --> 04:38:21.299 align:start position:0%
streams from the town
 
04:38:23.929 --> 04:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
um so we would suggest that if the
 
04:38:26.269 --> 04:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
committee would like to pass this bill
 
04:38:29.289 --> 04:38:29.299 align:start position:0%
that they adopt an amendment that would
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
preserve that two dollar fee going and
 
04:38:34.369 --> 04:38:34.379 align:start position:0%
being kept in the town I've spoken with
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor he would not object to
 
04:38:38.570 --> 04:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
that Amendment thank you
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:45.769 --> 04:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
representative bankerberg could just
 
04:38:55.849 --> 04:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.859 --> 04:39:06.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:39:06.109 --> 04:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
and signing in we have one in favor four
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
against and that closes the public
 
04:39:15.769 --> 04:39:15.779 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 116.
 
04:39:17.929 --> 04:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
so the committee probably wants to know
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
what to expect now
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're likely to exec both of these bills
 
04:39:24.010 --> 04:39:24.020 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday
 
04:39:28.010 --> 04:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the day will be as many
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
bills as I can Cobble together so it
 
04:39:31.849 --> 04:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
should be a fairly
 
04:39:34.970 --> 04:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
full day we'll we'll start at 10 and get
 
04:39:37.131 --> 04:39:37.141 align:start position:0%
through as many bills as we can and exec
 
04:39:38.810 --> 04:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
04:39:41.150 --> 04:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.760 --> 04:39:53.410 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:39:53.410 --> 04:39:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
what do you mean like when they put
 
04:40:04.570 --> 04:40:04.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know my first time since we
