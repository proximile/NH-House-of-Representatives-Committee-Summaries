00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
this is going to turn out to be
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
more of an informational slash
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
working meeting
 
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%

persistent votes on this we may
 
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
want to just take a sense of where
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's at but that if if we do that
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
it'll whatever process we use will be
 
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.310 align:start position:0%
it'll whatever process we use will be
informal

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
informal
 
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 align:start position:0%

thank you representative edwards and
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee good morning
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
just for the record john from ella
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
over the past couple weeks since the
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
last work session we've really made an
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
effort to have discussions with
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders have discussions with
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council
 
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.909 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council
and

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
the results of those discussions were
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
the proposed or potential edits that we
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
submitted earlier this week that i think
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
to my right uh as before is senior
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general now jen
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
ramsey just as a quick aside i just want
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
to make everyone aware jen was just
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
promoted earlier this week to senior
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general so that
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
reflects the
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
excellent work she's she's doing for the
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
office so that reflects more than just a
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
senior moment
 
00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
senior moment
yes

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.189 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
so jen has been instrumental in
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
in leading the effort to put some of
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
these proposed revisions down on paper
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna have her take the lead on
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
at least initially walking you through
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
these revisions but we'll both be here
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
to answer questions she and i have
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
discussed these extensively so we're
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
both familiar with them but as the
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
primary drafter i wanted to give jen the
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to walk these uh walk you
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
through these so i will turn it over for
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
the moment to senior assistant attorney
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
general jennifer ramsey
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you miss ramsey and our mr
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
attorney general and ms ramsey uh we do
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
we do have the documents in front of us
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
and so um but i don't think these are
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
viewable by the uh
 
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.589 align:start position:0%
viewable by the uh
public

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
so just to get it on the record if you
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
could touch upon each one
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
but because i'd like to keep this to 30
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
to 45 minutes if you could just be
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
judicious about how much time you spend
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
on each one
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
obviously if it's a minor thing just let
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
us know if it's a if it's a major
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
thought process we would like to
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
that sounds great
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
so for the record jennifer ramsey
 
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
so for the record jennifer ramsey
and

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
i think everybody has a document that
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
says summary of recommendations for
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
amendment at the top of it
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
um i would uh like to try to take them
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
instead of in the order on that document
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
just to take them instead in the order
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
that they appear in the in the language
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
of the bill if that would be helpful
 
00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.390 align:start position:0%
of the bill if that would be helpful
um

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
i may be the only one but it would be
 
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
more helpful
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
by a factor of eight if we were to go
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
down your summary document
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
and and then if we uh
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
and then just even if we're jumping
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
around in the document just
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
because we're also going to be putting
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
time stamps our
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
clerk is going to be using your summary
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
sheet as a way to have our minutes taken
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
and we're going to
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
time stamp the meeting instead of taking
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
document notes
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to do it that way as well
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:37.509 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
if we start then with the the first item
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
on the summary is uh one of the things
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
that we did after input was uh we talked
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
about this last session we expanded the
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
right to know coverage to include
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements not being a part
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the confidentiality of
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
of the documents of the ydc settlement
 
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
of the documents of the ydc settlement
fund

00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
we also included in this latest draft of
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
the bill a typographical error i think
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
that was also the subject of a previous
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
amendment and then we on the
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation and input of a lot of
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
members in the victim advocate community
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
have strengthened the the language in
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
the statement of purpose
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're no longer reflecting that
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
abuse may have ac occurred we're we're
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
reflecting uh that we are investigating
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
abuse um and we've included a statement
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
that um that we want to acknowledge that
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
if i could just ask you to slow down a
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
little bit because in your 40 seconds
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
you just went through three things on
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
three different pages
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i i want people to be able to see
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
what the change is okay so if you could
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
pace us through
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
as we look at your document and look at
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay so the language i was just
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
referring to is on page one it's item
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
and you strengthened this the purpose
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
statement in what way would you would
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
you just talk to the uh add-on here sure
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
so you'll see in line two that we remove
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
the language which may have occurred
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
and that's uh because of some feed that
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
back that we received from the the
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
advocates community that that language
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
might be offensive to victims
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
we are referring to this as an
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
investigation into abuse and we've also
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
added a statement um acknowledging the
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
claims and and what the victims have
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
all right that's clear to me thank you
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay next if we move to language on page
 
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.509 align:start position:0%
okay next if we move to language on page
4

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
4
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay explain what we're doing here
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
yep you'll see that we have created an
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
affirmative obligation of
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
confidentiality on the part of the
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
administrator of the fund um the
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
claimant is not bound by that and can
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
speak freely but to the extent that the
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
claimant which is to have
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh remain private this would create an
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
obligation on the administrator
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand that
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
if there are questions as we go uh get
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
my attention
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
because while the topic is fresh in
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
everyone's mind we can address it but so
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
far i think we're all tracking or do you
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
have something representative earth
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
i am tracking but i just want to be
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
clear that the summary recommendations
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
for amendment no longer has the correct
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
line number references is that an
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
accurate statement
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
if you have a version that was generated
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
by the um
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
by the legislative services group i
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
don't have that version so that may be
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
the reason for the differences
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
it does look like they're adding numbers
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
to me well we would see something just
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
that has a number four in a circle next
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
to it next to line 24 and line 24 begins
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
g claims on all documents which i think
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
is what you were just talking about
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
is that are you looking the same thing
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the same language you are
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
but my document is numbered differently
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
so who who can you
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
where is the variation coming from here
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman that copies you
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
received are my notes so the the circled
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
numbers is my notes from these
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
from the recommendations
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
and i also wrote my notes in there so
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
the circled numbers are what i
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
referenced as the recommendations well
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
it looks like you reform out of the
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
document too
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
so so i i appreciate you letting us use
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
your document representative long i i've
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
i've been finding it useful so
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
um i i think
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think if we can get into the right
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and so we at least see the
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
you know the language and we're tracking
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
with what ms ramsey is saying
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
we we should not be too worried about
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
the line numbers at this point because
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
right so i think we're all looking at
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
that i think so too it's just something
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then and then i asked for pat long's
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
notes to get xeroxed because he had he
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
had red and yellows
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
and it just made it easier to track okay
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
think i think if we
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
are trying to understand intent we ought
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
so so so representative irf plays a
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
vital role on division three finance of
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
making sure that all of the debits and
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
credits are lined up properly so
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
so are you are you are you okay ready to
 
00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.710 align:start position:0%
so are you are you are you okay ready to
roll

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
roll
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
okay so is there a question about that
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
section or just the
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
no i i think the general question was
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
just curiosity on off by the
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
representative on how we should be using
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
and viewing these documents
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
my my main concern is that we are able
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
to understand what the ag's office was
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
thinking and that we're able to
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
correlate that to the written word so
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i think you're doing that
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so should we move on to number
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
five mr chairman
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative walsh yeah can i just ask
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
the ag to slow down just a little uh you
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
guys are have been working with this
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
every single day you're intimately aware
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
of it we're playing catch-up i'm trying
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
to read this and you're going faster
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
than we can read and absorb it so just
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
slow down just a little so we actually
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
have time to read it before you move on
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind please i'm happy to do
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
we're

00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
we're slowly ready when you are okay
 
00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:24.150 align:start position:0%
we're slowly ready when you are okay
um

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
if we're ready number five um
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
should be a quick one page three lines
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
twenty eight to twenty nine
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
we just changed
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
the date of the ending of the claim
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
filing window so it was previously a one
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
year period and now it's a two-year
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes moon representative mooney if you
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind um i have a question on
 
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.590 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind um i have a question on
that

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and thank you for your
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
presentation your emails i thought the
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
materials were very clear so thank you
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
my question on moving that date what are
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
the pros and the cons of a one year
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
versus a two year window
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
or vice versa i find that section
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
particularly to be very critical
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
do you have a thinking that one or the
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
other is is preferable
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that in one year it
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.269 align:start position:0%
would be
managed

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
managed
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
i guess more reasonably as opposed to
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
over two years time
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps things might get
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
lost in the shuffle and not be as tight
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
as they would be in a one-year window
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for that the
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
reason that we expanded it was based on
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
feedback at the last working session
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
that there were also folks that felt
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
that one year would be too short of a
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
time period that um that because this is
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
a process for people um to be have the
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
courage to sort of come forward with
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
these types of allegations that we
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
needed to give
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
more time
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
for people to
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
come forward and not rush them through
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
the process but i understand what you're
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
saying as well
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
so so let's use this as a teaching point
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
for a second um
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
last meeting that you were here
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
you received a lot of feedback from
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
representatives and and so
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
you've gone away you've consulted with
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff's attorneys where possible
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
and you've applied your own independent
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
thought so on this particular point what
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
i assume happened was it had been one
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
year you heard that maybe two years is
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
better regardless of what you heard it
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
got you thinking and in your independent
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
judgment you think the two-year
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
window is superior to a one-year window
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that this document doesn't
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
just represent what we said but this
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
represents your professional independent
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
judgment on the right way to go i i
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
think you've stated it well
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay thank you and and
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
there were to add to that there were
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
people that thought it should be much
 
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.510 align:start position:0%
people that thought it should be much
longer

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
and after giving it more consideration
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
we thought two
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
item six is uh that we recommended to uh
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
lift the 100
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
the 1980 uh date restriction for claims
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
again we rethought that after feedback
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
at the last work session
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
date recommendation that claims would
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
not be for incidents occurring prior to
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
1980 was based on the attorney general's
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
general sense of the
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
where the most of the claimant's claims
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
lie um and we have since been um
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
persuaded that there may be claims that
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh lie in earlier
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
dates and then it makes good sense to to
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
include those claims in the bill as well
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
so your intent is just to open this up
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
to anybody anytime
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
correct with the with the uh language in
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
the bill still being that administrators
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
of its estates cannot file claims um so
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
there will be some as a practical matter
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
limitation on people that are still
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
living but other than that anybody who
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
has a claim of this type that was ever
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
at the ydc or one of the other
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
facilities would be entitled to
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
participate in this process
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
your mask is fine but if you would turn
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
on your mic and speak directly into the
 
00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
on your mic and speak directly into the
mic

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
mic
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
we we have people out there like
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative rogers i believe who are
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
trying to follow and and yeah so
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
directly into the mic please get it
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
close to you
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
mr mr ripple would you help him with the
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
mic i i'd really like it clear
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
do you still have a question
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
no just one page i'm just trying to
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
catch up where we're at
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
and we were we were talking about
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.029 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
so do you have a question or are you
 
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.789 align:start position:0%
so do you have a question or are you
okay

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
all right no no sweat representative
 
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.470 align:start position:0%
all right no no sweat representative
walls

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
walls
 
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.270 align:start position:0%
walls
yeah

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
i think representing the hatch still
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
needs a redline copy of this he doesn't
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
have that and i don't know who has them
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
around here
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
you got an extra right there we're we're
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're leveraging representative long's
 
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
we're leveraging representative long's
homework

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
we're

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
leveraging representative long's
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
homework this is his document it's got
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
his notes and markups on it
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to proceed if we're
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
not learning something so
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
what number are you on now seven i think
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
we're on to seven which is at page two
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
and again in response to feedback we
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
received we determined that it was a
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
good idea to expand the
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
facilities that
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
people resided in to include
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
institutions that may have pre-existed
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
okay i have a question about that it's
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know i can see what you're trying to
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
include i just want to make sure i i
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
know that we're excluding things like
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
for example somebody placed in a foster
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
home would would they qualify or not
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
no because they are
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
not in a facility that housed
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
adjudicated youth or detained youth
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
awaiting adjudication
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh question by representative long thank
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman with respect to seven
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
would that be only juvenile petitions
 
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:51.909 align:start position:0%
would that be only juvenile petitions
that

00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
had a petition
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
against them
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
clear is that a clarifier that would be
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
my understanding that they would not be
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
at the facility unless they were either
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
being detained
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
adjudication or had been adjudicated
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
moving on to
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
number eight
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see we've
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
clarified the definition of sexual abuse
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
and that's because in our research we
 
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
and that's because in our research we
uh

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
determined that under the applicable
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
case law
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
in prosecuting criminal claims that
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
coercion can actually be a requirement
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
relevant criminal statutes that we
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh identified as a part of the
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
definition of sexual abuse so even
 
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
definition of sexual abuse so even
though

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
though
a

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
a
victim

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
victim
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
even though consent is not a defense
 
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.870 align:start position:0%
even though consent is not a defense
to

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
the crime
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
it still requires an element of coercion
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
to prosecute someone they have to have
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
taken some affirmative act
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
to try to coerce the victim into
 
00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:14.149 align:start position:0%
to try to coerce the victim into
participating

00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
participating
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't think it was appropriate to do
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
that in this context we feel that there
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
is no situation
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
in which a staff member should ever have
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
been having sexual contact with a victim
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
even if there was consent and even in
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
the absence of an affirmative act so
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that we clarified the
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
definition so even if
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
the victim is
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
above the age of consent and the
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
allegation is the entire act was
 
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
allegation is the entire act was
consensual

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
consensual
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
this is intended to
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
say no there is no consent regardless of
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
the victim's age you you are correct uh
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess i really have a question i
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
went back and read foss this morning and
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
i and i and i also looked at the statute
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
and the law i mean the statute has been
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
changed a little bit but with regard to
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
the element of an affirmative act that's
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
still in the law and i guess the thing
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
that concerns me a little bit is
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
the statute specifically talks the
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
criminal statute specifically talks
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
about an affirmative act being required
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
even in this circumstance and even with
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
a juvenile so i guess i'm really
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
troubled by the idea of why would we
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
why would we say
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
why would we make the state liable to
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
pay compensation for something that's
 
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.870 align:start position:0%
pay compensation for something that's
not

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
a violation of the statute
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
so i would give you two answers to that
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
um first is the the fact that um
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
looking for that affirmative act seems
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate when we are talking about
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
taking someone's liberty away and and
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
prosecuting someone criminally whereas
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're using a criminal definition but
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is really about civil
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh liability um so
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
the the second answer which is really
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
just an example of why is um you can
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
imagine a situation unfortunately where
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
a victim
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
would actually believe that
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
that they were going to have a
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with a guard when they
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
graduated from this facility
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
there might be no coercion or there
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
might be something that doesn't really
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
satisfy the criminal definition of
 
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.310 align:start position:0%
satisfy the criminal definition of
coercion

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
if that person is telling someone that
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
they really like them that they that
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
they want to marry them when they get
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
out um i don't think that would qualify
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
as coercion under foss but that i think
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
should qualify as a claim under this
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
under the statute vascular follow-up yes
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i i mean can you tell me i this is
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
something i didn't do but is i mean is
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
there a body an established body of
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
case law in the civil context that says
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
someone can be held liable in these
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances without
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
coercion because i guess what i'm
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about is if there is then
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
maybe that's one thing if there isn't
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
you know are we
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
would the legislature in some sense be
 
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.750 align:start position:0%
would the legislature in some sense be
establishing

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
a precedent for other cases to say you
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
the common law of new hampshire as sort
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
of supported by the legislature is that
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
you don't need that
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
i understand your your concern i would
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
refer you then to the cases that we
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
provided several sessions back in the
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
settlement and verdict research where
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
quite a number of cases that have been
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
settled and the verdicts rendered and
 
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.990 align:start position:0%
settled and the verdicts rendered and
the

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the view as to what constitutes
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse in the context of this
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
civil litigation arena
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
okay and and though and those do those
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
support the view that you don't need an
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
affirmative act there are very few
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
verdicts there are mostly settlements
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the and the
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
groups are not being
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
parsed by whether or not there was any
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
coercion that just seems to be the view
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
in those cases that
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
if there is sexual activity between
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
a staff member and an inmate for any
 
00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:03.990 align:start position:0%
a staff member and an inmate for any
reason

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
even if it's consensual and even if the
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
staff member actually believes that
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to marry this child after
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
they leave the facility that that still
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
qualifies as something that needs to be
 
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.669 align:start position:0%
qualifies as something that needs to be
compensated

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
compensated
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
okay all right follow up are you okay no
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead representative walsh
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
is that true that there can be no
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
consent from somebody incarcerated be it
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
a child or an adult if there's a sexual
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
act there that because of the power
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
dynamic because somebody's being guarded
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
and somebody's an inmate there can be no
 
00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.590 align:start position:0%
and somebody's an inmate there can be no
consent

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
right and that's the concept that we're
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
trying to capture with the language that
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
we've included um in this proposed
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
amendment for you um and the the anomaly
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
is just that under the criminal law
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
there is some case law out there that
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
even though that is accurate and consent
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
is is not a defense in the case of the
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
power uh disparity that you just
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
described there is nevertheless in order
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
to incarcerate someone a requirement
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
defendant needs to have done something
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
affirmative to to cause the contact and
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
and what constitutes coercion under the
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
case law under foss gets into a murky
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
area that we didn't think we wanted to
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
deal with um in trying to adjudicate
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up are you okay
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
in light of the question it was asked i
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
mean if my understanding is that foss
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
specifically dealt with the issue that
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative walsh raised that that
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
even the statute says consent in the
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances cannot
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
cannot be given but the court
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
specifically said that's not enough to
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of the
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
of the criminal law and i if i
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
if i understood what you said in
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
response to an earlier question i think
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying that there is no
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
there is no developed body of case law
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
in the civil area that says
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
you don't need some affirmative act
 
00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:07.510 align:start position:0%
you don't need some affirmative act
there's

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
there's you say there's a number of
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
cases have been settled but i don't
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
you haven't said that there's some
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
established body of case law that says
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
you don't need an affirmative act so i
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
haven't gone and researched exactly the
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
way you're phrasing this we can
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
certainly go back and look um and and
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
then address that further and
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
where we are right now is just based on
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
what i had previously described thank
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
you sure
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
so so let me summarize that in layman
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
language um uh i'm not an attorney uh a
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
fascinating conversation um as i
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
what we're not the judiciary we're a
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
finance committee okay and and so
 
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.350 align:start position:0%
finance committee okay and and so
um

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
i while i completely understand and in
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
to the notion that an incarcerated
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
individual is unable to consent just the
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
consent is off the table
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
um i i am concerned that if this is the
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
first legislative act
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
establishing it in our statutes that for
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
all civil procedures
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
this precedent would would hold because
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
we're passing a law
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'm uncomfortable with that i i think
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would need
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
to run through the judiciary for example
 
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
to run through the judiciary for example
and

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
and so it so i do appreciate you saying
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to research this and do
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
some homework if you could maybe offline
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
stay in touch with the representative
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
lynn i i again i deferred to your
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
professional judgement i just wanted to
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
let you know
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
um i i i think we're better staying in
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
our lane and arlene is not creating new
 
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.710 align:start position:0%
our lane and arlene is not creating new
judicial

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
precedent for civil procedure
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that and i think we could
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
probably address that as well by making
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
clear that
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
nothing about the administration of this
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
claims process is to be taken as a
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
precedent for other litigation purposes
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
attorney general ramsey just said what i
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
was going to basically reinforce and
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
that is this is this is a very narrow
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
thing in the statute limited to this
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
system and it is not precedent for other
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
civil cases out there it's very clear
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
that it's a limited
 
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.710 align:start position:0%
that it's a limited
um

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
situation where coercion would not be
 
00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:29.590 align:start position:0%
situation where coercion would not be
required

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
well i mean i guess
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
that then the question would become why
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
why is it you know why is it
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate in this case as opposed to
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
any other k i mean suppose that there's
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh a case suppose we have a new facility
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
you know we we replaced the sununu
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
center with a new facility a couple of
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
years from now and something like this
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
happens um is the law
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know what would be the reason for
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
saying that you know the law shouldn't
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
be as it as it now would be under this
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
case i'm i'm just concerned about
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
why are we carving out a spec
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
please don't misunderstand me i'm very
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to victims that were that
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
that were abused but why are we carving
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
out a special
 
00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:19.190 align:start position:0%
out a special
uh

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance for this case sure no and
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's a great question um i think that uh
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
if we were to make clear that this was
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
not to be automatically taken as
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
precedent for future litigation purposes
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's not going to preclude lawyers
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
from arguing that for the same reasons
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
we decided to do it here they might want
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
to the courts might want to expand the
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
law or might want to apply it but i
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want it to be taken as an
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
automatic expansion of the law i would
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
want the judiciary to be able to
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
to consider that in the fullness of a
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
developed record in an individual case
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
i i think we're ready to go to the next
 
00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:08.149 align:start position:0%
i i think we're ready to go to the next
point

00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay i think i think we've made it
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
number nine yeah which is uh
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
which you'll find at page three lines
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
so again in response to concerns raised
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
we've considered whether
 
00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:36.230 align:start position:0%
we've considered whether
the

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
just notice within the state and just in
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
the old traditional way of publication
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
in a newspaper
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
locally would be sufficient notice and
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
on consideration we've expanded
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
the notice requirements to include
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
at least one national publication and
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
within the administrator's discretion
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
to publish in social media outlets
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
again we had uh requests to consider
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
doing much more than that but
 
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.230 align:start position:0%
doing much more than that but
i've

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
i've
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
looked into the expense
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
and what would be involved in some of
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
those things and our our judgment was
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
that the best would best thing to do
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
would be to leave it to the
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
administrator to make those decisions
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
tie the administrator's hands regarding
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
for example using youtube or twitter or
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
all of the various platforms that were
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
suggested to us
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
those are significantly
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive in some cases and i
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
would want the administrator to make the
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
determination whether or not
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
to um that the expense was justified so
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
so this causes me to to jump ahead and
 
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.669 align:start position:0%
so this causes me to to jump ahead and
and

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
recommend i believe the creation of an
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
administrator to just manage the whole
 
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.109 align:start position:0%
administrator to just manage the whole
program

00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:54.550 align:start position:0%
program
um

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
is it in that i i'm not there yet is it
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the administrator's charge to act as
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
a fiduciary and manage administrative
 
00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.710 align:start position:0%
a fiduciary and manage administrative
costs

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
wisely is there is that part of their
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
accountability or or are they going to
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
sort of a built-in incentive to
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
advertise and spend tons of money just
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
because you're they can't be wrong if
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
they do that
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
right so there's a tension there um but
 
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.910 align:start position:0%
right so there's a tension there um but
the

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
reason for the move to a more
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
independent administration
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
was concerns that
 
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.829 align:start position:0%
was concerns that
victims

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
victims
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
needed to feel protected in this process
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
in order to protect participate so um
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
the the guard rails on the
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
administrators expenses if you will is
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
that the administrator will be making
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
annual reports to the legislature
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
which will include information about the
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
expenses that have been incurred and
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
that are anticipated to be incurred
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.510 align:start position:0%
uh and
and

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
we would anticipate also that in the
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh search for and and
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
selection of an administrator that the
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office would be
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
involved and would be
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that the billing process
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
that would happen by the administrator
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be something that where the
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
state's interests would be protected
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
all right all right on the list of 100
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
things we need to worry about with this
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
program this is this is like in the 90s
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
cautious overspending to get the word
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
out because getting the word out is
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
critical to this program and the
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
perception that it's fair um i i just
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're not
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
creating a
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
a bad incentive to just grossly
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
overspend right and that we share that
 
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.790 align:start position:0%
overspend right and that we share that
concern

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
so first representative walls and then
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a national database
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
out there where we can
 
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.230 align:start position:0%
out there where we can
input

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.829 align:start position:0%
input
the

00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
former residents of these institutions
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
and find out if they are incarcerated
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere outside the state of new
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire so that either the state or
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
even the plaintiff's attorneys could
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
have access to that information and
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
could reach out to those potential
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
victims even though they're they're
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
currently incarcerated around parole or
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
probation outside the state of new
 
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.550 align:start position:0%
probation outside the state of new
hampshire

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
i believe law enforcement has access to
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
a database like that i don't on the
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
civil side we do not have access to
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
could we do something to to make that
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
kind of access for to the administrator
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
to somebody for purposes of informing
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
these victims of what their rights are
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
we we can certainly look into that um
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
we we had not
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
included a suggestion that notice would
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
go out to every former resident of the
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
facility because that would be an
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
enormous process to try to locate those
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
those individuals but the idea that we
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
might just locate people that are
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
currently incarcerated in other states
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
is something we can look into
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative yeah i have i have this
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
is probably the area that i have the
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
greatest concern uh from
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
from changing the original proposal and
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
i guess i have several uh
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
concerns just to start
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
from the beginning i mean
 
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
from the beginning i mean
um

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
it strikes me that
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
at least as i anticipated and correct me
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong under the original proposal
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
the administrator would be either the
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
attorney general or someone that the
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
attorney general designated within his
 
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.990 align:start position:0%
attorney general designated within his
office

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.190 align:start position:0%
office
correct

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
under this it would be an attorney in
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
private practice and so i guess in terms
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
of the cost
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
i mean just at you know at the at the
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
initial level my suspicion would be
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
that if let's even let's assume that
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
this process went on for you know a
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
period of
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
three or four or five years
 
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
three or four or five years
that

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
the difference in cost between
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
what somebody even a senior person in
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office would be
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
paid over five years and what a lawyer
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
in private practice would be paid over
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
five years would be
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
very very significant
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
so let me ask are we effectively on line
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
10 now because of the
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
the way the conversations matured yes i
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
think 10 11 uh we can talk about
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
together and are sort of a part of this
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
conversation so i'd like you to go ahead
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
and address representative lynn's uh
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
question i i our clerk is using your
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
summary sheet to keep track of where
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
we're at for the minutes so okay
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry no you're great that's i
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
guess the only thing i would say i am so
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
honored to have you
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
on this committee you do whatever you
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
want and will adapt well no no you know
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
what the only reason i i said this is i
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
just to avoid confusion because in item
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
10 you mentioned i think correctly that
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
the change to the
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
the change in the way the administrator
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
operates apply goes throughout the
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
statute it's not just in one or two
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
places it really goes kind of throughout
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
the statute that's right so i and i was
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
raising just the the first concern i had
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
is simply a money concern that it seems
 
00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:18.710 align:start position:0%
is simply a money concern that it seems
that

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
if we're going to get and i assume we
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
would all everyone would agree claimants
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office all of us
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
would agree that if we were going to
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
select an outside attorney we would want
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
a very competent experienced you know uh
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
well thought of attorney to do this
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
and it strikes me that
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
to get someone in private practice that
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
meets those qualifications
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and determine what you know what
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're likely to have to pay that person
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
is a lot more
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh than what you would likely pay
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
someone in the who was working in the
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office even if the
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
person was a very senior well-qualified
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
fair impartial et cetera person in the
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office right i i feel
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
the same way that you do about the this
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
this revision is going to increase the
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
cost of administration
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
the trade-off for the balance is um
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
trying to have an independent
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
administrator but also trying to control
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
those costs which is why the attorney
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
general's office is not completely out
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the process when we get to um item
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
items 10 and 11 or if we're there now
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
the um the idea is for the attorney
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
general to um try to resolve the claims
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
directly with the claimant and then if
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
the claimant is not satisfied that the
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
process would then move into an uh an
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
administrator's kind of resolution
 
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
administrator's kind of resolution
proceeding

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
but in that way we would hope to keep
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
the costs down still i've also inquired
 
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.910 align:start position:0%
the costs down still i've also inquired
um

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
we had actually thought maybe a a
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
retired judge or a mediator would also
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
be a good candidate for this um
 
00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:03.910 align:start position:0%
be a good candidate for this um
in

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
working with receiverships which also
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
involve a claim process
 
00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:10.870 align:start position:0%
involve a claim process
that

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
the claim
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
the the work that is done does not get
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
billed typically at a lawyer's rate for
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
litigation it's typically somewhat less
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
because you do not have the overhead
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
that you have with maintaining a law
 
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
that you have with maintaining a law
office

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't expect typical litigators
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
rates but i agree with you this is going
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
to increase the cost by having an
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
independent administrator but we felt it
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
was necessary in order to
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
give claimants a level of comfort that
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
they would actually use the process
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead and follow up follow up so i i
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
was did you have any discussion or was
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
any thought given to the idea of
 
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.630 align:start position:0%
any thought given to the idea of
possibly

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
amending the the proposed legislation to
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know an administrator will be hired
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh to do just this work but will be
 
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.150 align:start position:0%
uh to do just this work but will be
employed

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
employed
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh in the attorney general's office or
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
maybe some other agency of state
 
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.390 align:start position:0%
maybe some other agency of state
government

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
um you know at a at a determined salary
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know getting bills for even even at
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
a discounted rate i suspect it would be
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
i think the attorney would like to pipe
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
in on that one sure yeah i think the
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
answer would be we didn't discuss that
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
specifically but that goes to
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
something i wanted
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
to just add into attorney ramsey's
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
response i mean my thought is this if we
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
were to go this route and and look to
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
select an independent administrator we
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
would consider those types of options it
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
would not be my intent to to immediately
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
default to to hiring someone who would
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
then bill us hourly over and over again
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
and really jack up the administration
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
costs so i think the language as this is
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
written would potentially
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
allow for something like that but i
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
think that's something we could think
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
about because i
 
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.710 align:start position:0%
about because i
i

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
i agree with your concerns about
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
expenses i think we want
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
the idea is we want someone more
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
independent but we don't want to
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
hire a consultant right or a consultant
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
firm that has the administrator in it
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
that is then going to bill us at
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
exorbitant rates and trust me i'm very
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
sensitive to that because i deal with
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
that on all of the matters the office
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
deals with and that's something we we're
 
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.670 align:start position:0%
deals with and that's something we we're
always

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're always thinking about and we make
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
very strong efforts to get better deals
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
and better rates because we're we're
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
just a larger client and we're also
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
state government and not not some large
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
private corporation sure so it's it's
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
it'll absolutely be top of our mind and
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
i think that type of discussion is one
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
we could have around this concept of
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
trying to preserve independence but also
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
keep costs down
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
may i ask another follow-up yes sir this
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
and again this goes to the idea of the
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
administration the
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
two things that kind of concern me about
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
the this system that you're talking
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
about here is
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
in contrast to the original
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
proposal if i understand correctly here
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
the administrator
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
would be the fi there would be one
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
administrator who would be the final say
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
for all the cases
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
whereas under the
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
under the original proposal
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
the final say if if the claimant didn't
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
like what the administrator did the
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
final say would be with an arbitrator
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
and the arbitrator might
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know might or might not probably
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
would not be the same in all the cases
 
00:45:37.839 --> 00:45:38.710 align:start position:0%
would not be the same in all the cases
um

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
i mean that it seems to me that's a
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty big difference
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
because it may
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
which i i suppose could have various
 
00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.790 align:start position:0%
which i i suppose could have various
implications

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
implications
 
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.550 align:start position:0%
implications
um

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
but i wonder if you could talk to why it
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
makes sense to have
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
one person be the final voice without an
 
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.750 align:start position:0%
one person be the final voice without an
appeal

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.190 align:start position:0%
appeal
for

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
every for all the cases yep yeah i'll
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
i'll start and then i i definitely want
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
to then pass it over to attorney ramsey
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't miss anything but
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
i think there's a couple issues there
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
the first is the way this is set up is
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
even though the administrator would be
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
independent and there would be one
 
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.670 align:start position:0%
independent and there would be one
administrator

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's still kind of a similar process to
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
what we had before and that there would
 
00:46:23.359 --> 00:46:24.230 align:start position:0%
what we had before and that there would
be

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
an initial chance for
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
the ag designee and the claimant to
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
interact and for the ag designee to
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
present a view of the claim and what
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
they thought the claim should be valued
 
00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.349 align:start position:0%
they thought the claim should be valued
at

00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
and the claimant could agree to that
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
if there if the claimant doesn't agree
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
as the language now says the
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
administrator would schedule a
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
resolution process
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
and that's when you would really go
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
before the administrator and the
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
administrator would make a make a
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
binding decision so
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
on that issue i think
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
i think the process is still fairly
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
similar but what you have is you have a
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
more independent administrator who's
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
taking in the claims and running the
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
process the ag designee would still have
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
an initial opportunity to try to resolve
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
the claim
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
before you went before the administrator
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
to your second point which i think is is
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
a good one and it is something i've
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
thought about
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
there is a big difference between
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
or there's a difference between
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
the pre this version in the previous
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
version because i think you're right
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
if if something were submitted to
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
arbitration you're not guaranteed to
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
always have the same arbitrator and that
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
presents i think additional risk to to a
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
claimant and perhaps
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
lessens the incentive to go to
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
arbitration it also presents additional
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
risk i think to to the state because i
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
there there are factors to consider on
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
both sides there
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
and one factor i think about is that if
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
we have one administrator who's
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
independent who's becomes very familiar
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
with this process is very familiar with
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
the guidelines
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
who we would on the front end make sure
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
at least from our perspective has an
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
outlook about this entire process that
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
i think you could argue and i
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
i've been persuaded that that actually
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
might provide more
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
certainty that
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the outcome is fair the there
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
there'd be there could be a worry that
 
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.190 align:start position:0%
there'd be there could be a worry that
if

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
claims that went to arbitration
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
went to a different arbitrator every
 
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.549 align:start position:0%
went to a different arbitrator every
time

00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
you'd have results that
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
could really deviate from one another
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
they might be within the guidelines that
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
we establish but one arbitrator
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know might look at things
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
differently so
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
from another so
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
i think there are there are some risks
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
to it but i think there are also
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
potential benefits and when we balance
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
all of that with
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
with what i think is the major benefit
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
to persuading victims for to participate
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that is the the independence and
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
their feeling that they'll get a fair
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
shake that that's
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
we thought about all of that when
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
deciding to at least put this change
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
forward is something we thought we could
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
recommend um i want to make sure i
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
didn't miss anything so i do want to
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
pass it over to jen
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
i think the only thing i would add is
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
that if you have uh when you think about
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of the administrator is
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
compared to the cost of a number of
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
different arbitrators um it's an
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
incremental difference but it's not as
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
as large of a difference as it might
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise be no no i think you make very
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
valid points i mean that's why we have
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know we've we established a business
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
court we're talking about possibly
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
establishing a land use docket so they
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
have one i mean those are very valid
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
points that's just one other follow-up
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
the last point i had is if as i
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
understand the way
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is structured
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that the administrator
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
if i understand it would know
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
under this procedure in other words if
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
the the attorney general and the
 
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.990 align:start position:0%
the the attorney general and the
claimant

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
claimant
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
were not
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
able to come to an agreement the
 
00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.829 align:start position:0%
able to come to an agreement the
administrator

00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
as i understand it and correct me if i'm
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
wrong the administrator would know
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
at the time the administrator got the
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
case to decide
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
what the last offer was from the
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
attorney general and what the last uh or
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
the last offer what what the what each
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
party's position was on each side of the
 
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.109 align:start position:0%
party's position was on each side of the
issue

00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
at the time the administrator got to
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
decide the case
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm a little concerned that that
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
you know as a practical matter that
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
probably cabins
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
the administrator i mean it would be
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's the reason
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
generally settlement discussions are not
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
allowed to be introduced in a in a trial
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
and so is there
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know could this be structured in a
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
way that that
 
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.309 align:start position:0%
way that that
that

00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
the administrator would not know that
 
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.390 align:start position:0%
the administrator would not know that
information

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
i think it certainly could that's not
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
something i think we had had
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
contemplated that the administrator
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
would necessarily know
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
that what the last offer had been i
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
think we intended to structure it that
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
the claimant could
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
decide that it was happy with what the
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general designee valued the
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
claim at in which case the parties would
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
tell the administrator that they'd
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
agreed to an award and that the
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
administrator didn't need to give any
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
further attention to the claim um or if
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
not then the claimant would ask for an
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
administrator resolution proceeding so
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't have any you wouldn't
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
have any problem then if the if
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
if the language was toyed with a little
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
bit so that it would be clear that the
 
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.230 align:start position:0%
bit so that it would be clear that the
administrator

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
in that circumstances couldn't know what
 
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.109 align:start position:0%
in that circumstances couldn't know what
the

00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
what either side's uh
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know position was on dollars so to
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
speak would just know that they hadn't
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement right no i i
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
are you done represent blind
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative emery
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
as we're talking about money it occurred
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
to me that later on there's guidelines
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
for maximum fees for the attorney
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's attorney
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
at what point does it jump 25 to 33 in a
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
third percent let me just put a more
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
rounded question on that if it's to the
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
attorney's advantage to go to the
 
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.950 align:start position:0%
attorney's advantage to go to the
administrator

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
where the 33 and a third kicks in as
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to the 25
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
then administrators can be very busy
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
if money is a motivator
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
i and i don't i haven't read all this uh
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
changes to know when does that kick in
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you're correct that it it
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
would jump to the 33 and a third percent
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
if it moved from a resolution with the
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general to a resolution with
 
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.549 align:start position:0%
attorney general to a resolution with
the

00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
administrator and i think um
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good question i think
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
if it goes to a resolution proceeding
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
though that attorney is going to need to
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
do additional work to participate in
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
that proceeding and so
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
would be making those decisions that you
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
just described in light of
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
the fee may get bigger but he's rolling
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
the dice that would the award get bigger
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
i i might do better i might not do as
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
well as what the attorney general's
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
office has offered so i don't think just
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
the incentive of possibly getting a
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
larger fee alone would be the only
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
reason that someone would choose to move
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
to a resolution proceeding
 
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.750 align:start position:0%
to a resolution proceeding
okay

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
but but but it could be right because
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to make the settlement fund
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
award and release document and some form
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
publicly available and so the plaintiff
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys are going to have develop
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
rapidly a track record on the generosity
 
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.309 align:start position:0%
rapidly a track record on the generosity
or

00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
or parsimony of the
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
of the administrator so
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
i i i talked to the attorney general
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
about this i i'm just trying to make
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
our incentive system is is right we we
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
we want them to settle sooner
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
as long as we're taking care of the
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
justice part of it but i
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
i don't want to create a casino
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
environment where they go gaming the
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
system right
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
um and i i think we've tried to capture
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
that with the way that we have
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
structured it and we can certainly
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
continue look at that
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and then as uh
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative lynn was talking i i was
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
putting on my old manpower analysis hat
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i was trying to think through
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
the the way that we can imagine the
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
workload hit hitting the administrator
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
and i imagine the workload will be
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
relatively high pretty quickly
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then it will
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
peak probably within the first six
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
months to
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
12 months
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
and then it's going to start to have a
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
tail and that tail by this is expected
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
to potentially be 10 years
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
right i think if i understand it right
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
so so my my what i don't know if i
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
really have a question in here as much
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
as i just have a curiosity is is if
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
there gets to be a point where the
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
natural workload
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
seems to have been done at the
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
three-year point or something like that
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
do we have an off-ramp to excuse the
 
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.710 align:start position:0%
do we have an off-ramp to excuse the
administrator

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
short of four cause
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
or do we need one what do i maybe that's
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
really the first question for you is do
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
do we need an off ramp or are we going
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
to keep an administrator for 10 years
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an interesting thought the
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
current structure is that the
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
administrator would be reporting
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
regularly to the legislature and that
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
there's provision that the administrator
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
could wrap this up sooner than 10 years
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
if the workflow did what you just
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
suggested we'll have the claims window
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
will close after some period of time so
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
the universe of claims that need to be
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
dealt with will become finite and and
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
they will be making predictions to you
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
about um how many are left to be
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
resolved so
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
at some point you could naturally look
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
at this and say i think we should move
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
the lap state up and dismiss the
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
administrator and that would be a a
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
minor legislative act i would think
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay so you're you're saying that you
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
believe that the discretion is
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
completely in the hands of the
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
legislature to terminate the
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
relationship or are you saying the
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
administrator needs to make a motion or
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
something to terminate or
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
where where does that
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
discretion lie so i don't think we have
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
language in the bill right now that
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
would address that specifically and i
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
think i think the attorney general may
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
have some comments
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative and i know
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
we we discussed this earlier in the week
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah the bill right now doesn't provide
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for removing the
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
administrator in in an instant in
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
whatever circumstances you may want to
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
remove them under i think we do need to
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
00:56:52.799 --> 00:56:54.230 align:start position:0%
think about that
because

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
i think we would all hope that this
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
process would go well but there's any
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
you might want to remove
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
a state official for example and there
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
are processes to do that i think we that
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
is something we need to think about is
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
what mechanisms would we provide for
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
removal of the administrator under
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
various circumstances that we could
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
imagine which you might want to remove
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
them i think then to your point
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
you know what mechanisms are there to
 
00:57:17.839 --> 00:57:18.950 align:start position:0%
you know what mechanisms are there to
to

00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
to end the process when when there's no
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
longer a need for it
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
i i think the bill contemplates just
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
that the process would end naturally
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
when all the claims have been disposed
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
of but but we can think about that
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
as well i'm not as concerned about the
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
second point as i am about the first
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
which i think is something we should we
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
do need to think about there needs to be
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
there's really no state official or
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
anyone unappointed under state law who
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
who can remain in their position forever
 
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.150 align:start position:0%
who can remain in their position forever
and

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happens or whether
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
they commit malfeasance or whether
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
there's cause to remove them so i think
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
we need to think about think about that
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i want to do a sidebar real
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
quick uh representative umberger would
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
would you remind me when
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
this group needs to be done
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
with what it wants to recommend to the
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.549 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
do you need a moment to think about that
 
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.109 align:start position:0%
do you need a moment to think about that
no

00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
it has to be reported
 
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:19.990 align:start position:0%
it has to be reported
out

00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
mr attorney general
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
you you and attorney ramsey are talking
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
about going back and doing some thinking
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
deeper on a few things
 
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:35.510 align:start position:0%
deeper on a few things
what

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
how are you feeling about um the amount
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
i am confident that we can
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
so i guess it depends on where we end
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
today and what we think the the full
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
scope of the issues are that we still
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
need to address but
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
i have been aware of the march 10th
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
timeline this entire time and it's been
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know i've been thinking about it
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
we will i'm confident that we can think
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
about whatever issues are presented and
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
come back to you with proposed language
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
with plenty of time for you to consider
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
it and get the bill to a point where it
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
could be reported out by march 10th if
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's ultimately where you get to okay
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:18.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
so when last we looked at the summary i
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think we had just knocked out 10 and
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
yep and and number 12 is language that
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
appears on page three
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh at the bottom continuing on to the
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
and again this is just some language to
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
strengthen um
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
the perception on the behalf of of
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
claimants that this is
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
this is a process they can choose to
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
participate in but they're not required
 
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.510 align:start position:0%
participate in but they're not required
to

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
again strengthening that to make sure
 
00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:54.870 align:start position:0%
again strengthening that to make sure
that

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
they understand the
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
the decision that they're making and
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
enter into entering into this process
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
make sure they understood that they had
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
a right to consult with an attorney
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
since we are asking them to
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
commit to this process with a waiver of
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
rights to continue in litigation as a as
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
a part of their determination to
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
the next item is on page seven at light
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
lines one through ten
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
we had some further thinking about
 
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
we had some further thinking about
uh

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
how the administrator might utilize
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
installment payments in resolving claims
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
and wanted to make clear that that that
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
would be something about which the
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
claimant would primarily
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh get to decide and only in the case of
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh a claimant who wished to receive
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
periodic payments or a situation that
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
was so clearly uh warranted that kind of
 
01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.470 align:start position:0%
was so clearly uh warranted that kind of
um

01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
treatment that
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
that that would
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
that would be the only circumstance in
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
which that would be utilized
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
so yeah i think i i mean i i agree with
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
sort of the first part of that it seems
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
to me that it does make i mean a
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
claimant should
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
if if if you decide if if the state is
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
going to pay somebody the claimant
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
should decide whether they get it in an
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
installment or not i guess i'm a little
 
01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.349 align:start position:0%
installment or not i guess i'm a little
bit

01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
the last part of it uh
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know a compelling need to protect
 
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:30.230 align:start position:0%
the interests of the claimant
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:31.510 align:start position:0%
the interests of the claimant
[Music]

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
that has a little bit of the sort of
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
nanny state
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
part to it and i'm wondering
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know if the claimant
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
if the claimant and the claimant's count
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
who's represented by council say
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
we want the money right now
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and the claimant's
 
01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and the claimant's
competent

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
competent
 
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.549 align:start position:0%
competent
um

01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
what's the basis you know
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
to say you know
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
well you're really not very responsible
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to blow it all in a year so
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're not giving it to you
 
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.190 align:start position:0%
we're not giving it to you
so

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
yep um i can
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
i understand the concern it does it is
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
an exercise a little bit in paternalism
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh it it is limited to large awards
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
and it uh
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
it certainly is not something that has
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
to be included but we thought it would
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
be something that you might want to
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
consider doing since
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh there there
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
is a fair amount of information
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
out there in the literature that
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes receiving an enormous amount
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
of money right up front can actually be
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
harmful to a victim
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
it it it can have all kind believe it or
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
not it can have all kinds of traumatic
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
effects on the individual to
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
to suddenly receive that kind of an
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
sure i'd even say professional athletes
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
have that problem i mean and they're
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be competent so uh
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative lindsay i'm
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
wondering i mean would it make sense to
 
01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.990 align:start position:0%
wondering i mean would it make sense to
put

01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
put
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
something more specific into what the
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
administrator would have to find to be
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
because i i mean i
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
again it just
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
it just i it just seems to me to be
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
pretty distasteful for for an
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
administrator to be able to say with a
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
competent claimant represented by
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
competent counsel who say we want the
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
money now
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
for the you know the administrator to
 
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:30.950 align:start position:0%
for the you know the administrator to
say

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
what you're not
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
you're not responsible enough or your
 
01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.549 align:start position:0%
you're not responsible enough or your
lifestyle

01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
lifestyle
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that you're not responsible
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
enough to get the money you know i
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
mean i i agree with you on the on the
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
sports figures but they do get them you
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
know they they do get the money and are
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to blow it right 75 blow it and
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah representative erf do you
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
question would you mind if i respond oh
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
go oh go go ahead yeah so i i definitely
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
see the concern and we're wrestling with
 
01:04:00.799 --> 01:04:01.510 align:start position:0%
see the concern and we're wrestling with
it

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's a couple issues i just wanted to
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
point out one
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know we certainly don't want to be
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
paternalistic and we certainly don't
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
um not have respect for the victims
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
i do think it's important to remember
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
that that many of these victims are
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
have suffered a lot in their life not
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
just from abuse they may have suffered
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
at ydc but they may have suffered before
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
that they may have had really tough
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
times since that
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
whether we want the administrator to be
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
making you know compensated competency
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
determinations as you might make in the
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
criminal process i'd be reluctant to
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
have that but i i think that it makes
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
sense for an administrator who is
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
individuals who may be dealing with a
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
lot some are maybe incarcerated some may
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
struggle with substance abuse some may
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
struggle with any number of issues to to
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
to have some discretion to make those
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
determinations i think with this
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
with uh this population it it makes
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
sense and i know there's there's no way
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
to say that without that sounding
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps a little bit paternalistic and a
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
little bit disrespectful i i that only
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
comes though from a place i think of of
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern on our part but i
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
think that's that's an additional factor
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
that i think is important to remember
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
here the the the specific individuals
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with or that we've seen so far
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
come forward
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to follow up on that and
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
then go to representative irf and
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
representative hatch but
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
i i think we're probably all
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
in some
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
degree of agreement on the idea that if
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
the claimant is um
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
is credible and able to handle their
 
01:05:49.359 --> 01:05:50.470 align:start position:0%
is credible and able to handle their
financial

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
duties uh that
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
lump sum is perfectly appropriate if
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's what they want
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
i i i think what where the discussion
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
should spend a little bit of time is to
 
01:06:01.119 --> 01:06:02.390 align:start position:0%
should spend a little bit of time is to
say

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
to what extent does the administrator
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
have the ability
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
to inquire about
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
the claimant's competency
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know like for example let's say the
 
01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.029 align:start position:0%
you know like for example let's say the
individual

01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
has an active ongoing
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
drug problem
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
but there's not an open arrest there's
 
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.950 align:start position:0%
but there's not an open arrest there's
nothing

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
clearly in the public record about that
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
but but the person is incompetent
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
because they're
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
using drugs actively
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
how would this administrator even know
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know what sort of power are they
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to inquire into the
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
personal competency of the individual
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm less concerned about
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
doling it out over time because i think
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
it also protects the state's interests
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
to spread out the financial payments and
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we don't create a new
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
dependent on the state welfare system
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
quickly because they blow through the
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
money i i think there's a state interest
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
in this but but where i'd get concerned
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
about the confidentiality and and and
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
the paternalism of it is when we start
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
to talk about the administrator's
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
authority to inquire into the personal
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
lifestyle of the claimant because i
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
think there are privacy bounds in there
 
01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.910 align:start position:0%
think there are privacy bounds in there
and

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
what what are your thoughts on that
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
that wasn't something we had
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
contemplated that the administrator
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
would have some affirmative duty to
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
actively go investigate
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
i think the the intention of the
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
provision was to deal with the limited
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
circumstance in which an individual
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
presents maybe without counsel maybe
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
decides to to refuse counsel's
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation to take a
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
stream of payments fires this lawyer and
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
tells the administrator that he wants
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
the money uh immediately i don't i don't
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate that this is a provision that
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
would necessarily get invoked frequently
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
but it we thought it would be a good
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
option a good tool for the administrator
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
in his tool belt in in that instance
 
01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.470 align:start position:0%
in his tool belt in in that instance
um

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.309 align:start position:0%
and i
i

01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
think that it's it's as you say it's a
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's a the ability for the state to to
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
uh spread those payments out but i don't
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
think that's the primary purpose of it
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i can believe it's a good tool
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
i just am trying to understand
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
what the flow of information would be to
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
allow the
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
administrator to make an informed
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
decision on whether or not they want to
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
overrule the request of a lump sum and
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
opt instead for a
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
string of payments i i don't i don't
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
understand that so i think that in the
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the part of the claim resolution
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding which is going to get built
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
out as a part of the
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
the work that gets done after the bill
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
is passed the administrator in
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
consultation with the attorney general's
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
office and the plaintiff's council is
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
going to build a process um that that's
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
something that could be addressed in
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
that process with lots of input from
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council as well
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go back to costs if i may
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'm noting that when you eliminated the
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrator you eliminated the sharing of
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
expenses when you went to arbitration
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
that says to me
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
you've removed any incentive to settle
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
with the ag why would anybody waste
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
their time there when there's going to
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
be no costs associated with going to the
 
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.990 align:start position:0%
be no costs associated with going to the
administrator

01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
administrator
timing

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
timing
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
you could you could get a resolution
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office as
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
quickly as 90 days under this uh
 
01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.749 align:start position:0%
quickly as 90 days under this uh
proposal

01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to probably take much longer
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
particularly in the early stages of this
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
administration to get through a
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding with an
 
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.470 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding with an
administrator

01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
a follow-up if i may
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
you're referring to the claimant's
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
concerns about getting paid quickly but
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
the attorney is probably driving the
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
process his attorney or her attorney
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
and they don't have any time incentive
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
they have a money incentive
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
i mean you took out a huge part of the
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think the balance in the in the prior
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
proposal yeah and and i i don't know if
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to use an independent
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
administrator that it feasibly makes
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
sense to ask the claimant to pay a part
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the administration costs
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
i also think that that was an area where
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
it didn't feel good to victims to have
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
to pay for the privilege of being heard
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
by the arbitrator and so the balance
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
that we're recommending
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
kind of leans the other direction but i
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
certainly understand your concerns
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's the reason we had initially
 
01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.669 align:start position:0%
that's the reason we had initially
proposed

01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
the fee sharing
 
01:10:46.719 --> 01:10:47.510 align:start position:0%
the fee sharing
but

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
on further consideration
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
i think you know the overall
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
restructuring sort of makes more sense
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
to to have the administration fees be
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
are you okay
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh representative hatch
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
you still have a question well thank you
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'm just thinking through this
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
and a lot of my questions have been
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
answered by your questions but
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
and just thinking this through and i
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
just put my own circumstances in play i
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
have six children they're all great good
 
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.070 align:start position:0%
have six children they're all great good
kids

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
and five of them if they received a
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
bundle of cash would be very responsible
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
to it and and all good one not so much
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
but nobody would know that except mom or
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
dad or anybody close so is there a way
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
the administrator
 
01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.270 align:start position:0%
the administrator
to

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
dole out settlement
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
if he or she receives
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
proponents or germain information
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh from somebody that would maybe
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
want consideration of that
 
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.870 align:start position:0%
want consideration of that
hopefully

01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
some of these people have people close
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
around them that understand them
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe they would have an avenue to
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
present this information i don't know if
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
this makes sense or not uh hopefully
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
their attorneys if they have one
 
01:12:01.199 --> 01:12:02.149 align:start position:0%
their attorneys if they have one
um

01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
would maybe
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
aid in that event is there anything ever
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
done like that or is that
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
sensible or not for this i mean i don't
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
see an answer to this other than
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's a tough question and ultimately
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's something that you all will will
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
decide what you think is is best and and
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
of course um
 
01:12:22.719 --> 01:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
of course um
will

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know work with whatever you decide
 
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:26.950 align:start position:0%
you know work with whatever you decide
the

01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.229 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
i think what you're kind of describing
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
would be the possibility for for other
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
people to intervene maybe to express
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
their opinions
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
i worry that that might um bog the
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
process down in such a way that would be
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.159 --> 01:12:47.110 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for me
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
just a venue to allow it to be
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
considered is is all i'm thinking of and
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
not have a
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
pandora's uh box and end up being in any
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
state or an internal
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
thing just
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
some sort of venue and i and i think
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
let's not forget though also that
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
separate and apart from this process
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
people like you're describing there may
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
be other avenues within the legal system
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
for somebody to come and petition for a
 
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.189 align:start position:0%
for somebody to come and petition for a
guardianship

01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
guardianship
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
i think i think in an extreme case where
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
family members were concerned there
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
would be maybe other ways to address
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative mooney thank you mr
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
question at the time a claimant files a
 
01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.830 align:start position:0%
question at the time a claimant files a
claim

01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
claim
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
is the claim based solely on the events
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
that occurred while they were housed at
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
the detention center or can it and does
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
it branch out into extenuating
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances as an example what their
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
lives have been like
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
been out of work and so on so forth
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
it would just be based on events that
 
01:13:58.719 --> 01:14:00.070 align:start position:0%
it would just be based on events that
occurred

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
during their time at the detention
 
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.870 align:start position:0%
during their time at the detention
center

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
so so based based on um your
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
not just general knowledge of the cases
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
are we going to end up with any
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
there was contact post incarceration
 
01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:17.990 align:start position:0%
there was contact post incarceration
between

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
the prisoners and the guards
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
that would also with that i would assume
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
that would become extenuating
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
circumstance if there was some kind of
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
an ongoing relationship post
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
incarceration is is that is that just
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
are we just talking about something that
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
didn't happen or or is that possible
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
i i think it's possible that that
 
01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.910 align:start position:0%
i i think it's possible that that
happened

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think we contemplate though that
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
being considered as
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
as part of of this process i mean i
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
think where
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
that may come into play when you know
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
when when you're
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the likelihood that events
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
occurred while they were
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated at a detention center but i
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
think we would not be considering
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
contact or events that occurred once
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
they were not in
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the relevant facility
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i i'm not familiar with these
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
cases i just i'm curious
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
if somebody is
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
willing to abuse their power as a guard
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
if are they predisposed to being a
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
stalker you know so
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
can i follow up just on on
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative mooney's question i guess
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear i mean wouldn't it be
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
not at all unusual for someone who was
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
abused who claims to have been abused at
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
the ydc to say as in support of their
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
claim for damages
 
01:15:42.159 --> 01:15:42.950 align:start position:0%
claim for damages
well

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
as you know i maybe have an expert that
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
would support this well as a result of
 
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.590 align:start position:0%
would support this well as a result of
that

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.350 align:start position:0%
you know
i

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
my you know my
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
excuse my language but my life turned to
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
 and it turned to for a long
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
period of time so i you know i and as an
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
example you know i
 
01:15:58.719 --> 01:15:59.750 align:start position:0%
example you know i
um

01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
i've i've
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
frequently lost my job or been fired and
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know maybe would have to have
 
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.430 align:start position:0%
you know maybe would have to have
evidence

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
so i i could see a number of
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances where things that happened
 
01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:12.390 align:start position:0%
circumstances where things that happened
later

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
very relevant to damages yeah
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely i i think i interpreted
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative mooney's question maybe i
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
interpreted it not not exactly correctly
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
kind of as representative edwards raised
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
like would there be events
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
that happened once they were not in the
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
facility anymore that may
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
be compensable
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
there would be a basis for liability as
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to like like if because i have
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
thought about this and we we have seen
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
these circumstances where there may have
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
been contact with an individual by a
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
staff member after they were outside of
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
the facility right so i don't think we'd
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
be considering those events
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
in a in a matrix or in a set of
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines when it comes to determining
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
compensation but as for whether events
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
that happened
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
after the facil after someone was in the
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
facility whether those would be
 
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
facility whether those would be
considered

01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
in in deciding what what the damages
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
were or what the compensation should be
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think yes that would certainly
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
come into play
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh but that or at least it could
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
potentially come into play i think that
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
would depend
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
largely on how
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
how these guidelines end up getting
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
negotiated and how and how any claims
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
matrix ends up getting negotiated thank
 
01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:32.310 align:start position:0%
matrix ends up getting negotiated thank
you

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
so the one of the questions i was going
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
to ask you basically just answered but
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to say overall is i sort
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
of see this working the same way civil
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
claims work in the judiciary right now
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
and that is a measure of damages
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
includes harm that continues after the
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
act has happened so for example if you
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
broke your back and you can't work
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
that's part of the measure of damages
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
say in a traditional civil climb
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
similarly i would seem to me that
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
the judiciary has
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes they will do a lump sum award
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they pay the award over a
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
period of time if it's obvious that
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
expenses over a long period of time so
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
for example when you have a child that
 
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.430 align:start position:0%
for example when you have a child that
is

01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
born with disabilities and that can be
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
traced directly back to the birth
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
process and say you have a claim against
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
that ob gyn those claims can that amount
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
of money can be paid over a period of
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
time or putting a trust that goes over a
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
period of time it would seem to me that
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
the similar kinds of things could apply
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
here both for the measure of damages and
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
for the payment of it that we just use
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
the systems or were used as a precedent
 
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
the systems that are already in place
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
for civil damages
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say you're wrong in thinking
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
about that i would answer your
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
question though just with uh
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
with i think what will be the answer but
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
also but also a comment
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things we're trying to do
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
with this process is is balance the need
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
value these claims without
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
too much
 
01:19:13.679 --> 01:19:15.910 align:start position:0%
too much
um

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
how can i say it too much sort of
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
invasive questioning of how victims
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
lives have turned out you know after
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
they were incarcerated at at ydc or
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
after they were they were in ydc and so
 
01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.709 align:start position:0%
after they were they were in ydc and so
while

01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
i think while while those
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
well that could come into the discussion
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
i think what we would want not want to
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
do is end up in a situation where
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know beca horrible things happen to
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
a victim but because they were able to
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
pull their lives together you know they
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
they necessarily were compensated less
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
than someone who wasn't able to and it's
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
admirable when a victim can overcome
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
these types of events but i i don't
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
think we would
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to put ourselves in a
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
position where we're penalizing someone
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
for not overcome overcoming
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
things like that that happened to them
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
so so while i i do think we can
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
in valuing claims we can think about
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
what happens in the normal civil
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
litigation process this process is
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
designed to be different than that and
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
so i don't think
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
we that
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
the procedure for valuing claims will
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
will line up with traditional litigation
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
but isn't that part of the measure of
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
damages if you've got somebody that that
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
abuse that maybe they're
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
fragile emotionally because they had
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
other issues you know before they got
 
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.149 align:start position:0%
other issues you know before they got
there

01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
that would be the measure of damages if
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
they can't if somebody can hold a job
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
their measure of damages are going to be
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
different than somebody who can't hold a
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
job will never be able to hold a job
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
can't be in a relationship
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know it it seems to me that should
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
go to the measure of damages
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
right and that and that's why i'm saying
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would be irrelevant i'm
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
just making the comment that it's it
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
probably not necessarily to the same
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
extent as it would be if we were
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
litigating these cases in court
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
how this is going to end up how the
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
value how these claims are going to get
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
valued is going to be largely determined
 
01:21:09.679 --> 01:21:10.550 align:start position:0%
valued is going to be largely determined
by

01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
the claims process that's set up and the
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines that are agreed to and any
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
value matrix that's agreed to so it's
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
hard for me to sit here today and and
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
and know
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
how much that's going to come into play
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a subsequent
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
negotiation that has to take place but
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
but my sense is that to the extent that
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
comes into play it will be less so than
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the traditional litigation process
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
because you're right representative if
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
we were litigating these cases in court
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
that would be important you know what
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
what are the damages that flow
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
from this harm i think we'll still want
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
to consider that but given the reality
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
that we're going to try to
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
design a very efficient process that
 
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
design a very efficient process that
that

01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
it can move quickly that is
 
01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.709 align:start position:0%
it can move quickly that is
um

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
not not too invasive and doesn't require
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
too much examination of a victim's life
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
though it's just it's a reality that
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
those factors won't be taken into
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
account to the same extent they might
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
attorney ramsey i don't want to cut you
 
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.790 align:start position:0%
attorney ramsey i don't want to cut you
off

01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
so as i listen to this it seems to me
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
like um
 
01:22:20.719 --> 01:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
like um
the

01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
guideline matrix
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
that is going to be constructed
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
is going to be really kind of critical
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
to capture
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of this philosophical trade-off
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
sort of question that we're having and
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
and i've never
 
01:22:35.679 --> 01:22:36.550 align:start position:0%
and i've never
seen

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
a guideline like this i this is not my
 
01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.390 align:start position:0%
a guideline like this i this is not my
domain

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
domain
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
but i imagine that's going to be
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
critically important to this whole
 
01:22:44.639 --> 01:22:46.070 align:start position:0%
critically important to this whole
process

01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
what what
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
since that will occur after this
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is passed and after the the
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
house has dealt with this
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
what what process do you imagine
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
for just getting sort of a
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislative thumbs up on the uh
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
just for uh for a little bit of context
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
in some other um claims resolution
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
processes the matrix looks a little bit
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
like a chart of types of harm from from
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
very serious things down to not so
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
serious things with dollar amounts
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
assigned or ranges of dollar amounts
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
assigned for each type of harm that will
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
be able to be published and claimants
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
will know what their potential range of
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
recovery is going into this process so
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
to your question representative walls it
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
will be a little bit different than the
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
litigation process
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
and claimants will be able to choose
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
whether they want to go that traditional
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
litigation route and and have their
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
damages fully assessed like you're
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
describing or whether they would like to
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
participate in this alternative process
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
and know they'll know the range of what
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
they might be entitled to recover going
 
01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.590 align:start position:0%
they might be entitled to recover going
in

01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of the design of the process
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
the bill does not currently um just
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
before we leave that so also i imagine
 
01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
that part of that matrix is are the
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances that would
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
help decide what part of the range the
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
administrator would be on and and do you
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
think you you know enough to be able to
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
describe what the
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances might be will
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
that be public knowledge as well yeah
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
the gut
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think we contemplated that the
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines would be a document that
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
would include all of the factors that
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
might be go into the consideration of
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
where you would fall in the guidelines
 
01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.390 align:start position:0%
where you would fall in the guidelines
um

01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
things that have to do with
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
whether the claim has been raised any
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
time in the past
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of passage of time since the
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
claim whether the claim might have been
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
subject to legal defenses in the event
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
litigated all of those would be
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
articulated at the front end so that
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
claimants would understand the process
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
and then in terms of
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
did you so no i was just ready for you
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
to go into the process i didn't want you
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
to forget where you were before i
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
interrupted you sure no not a problem so
 
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
the um in terms of how that matrix would
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
be developed we've obviously already
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
been thinking about it and i'm sure
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council has as well
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
it was contemplated that we would meet
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
and confer and then the administrator
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
would ultimately make the decision this
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't currently have a provision for
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
legislative approval of that but if you
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to include it
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
one thing we had contemplated at one
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
point was that we would adopt that by
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
rule at the attorney general's office if
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
we have an independent administrator
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
that might be more difficult to do but
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
if the legislature wanted to have
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
oversight of the matrix we could
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
certainly build that in
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't be asking for anything
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's outside i this is not a normal
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
thing we're doing but i don't think it
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
goes completely without precedent so
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the whatever the appropriate
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight or or or
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
participation would be i would just ask
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
that you guys think about it and let us
 
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.790 align:start position:0%
that you guys think about it and let us
know

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah another option in addition to
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
adopting the the process by rule would
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
be for approval by the fiscal committee
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
say that's that's a
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's a fairly typical way to approve
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
something in a more efficient manner
 
01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
because we all know the rulemaking
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
process is
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
is can take a while but um but we can
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
think about that i'm sure plaintiff's
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
counsel will also have something to say
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
about that yeah so i i would i would
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
definitely buy off on the idea that once
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
this is uh all set up that it should be
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative lynn may i just ask a
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
question really in follow-up to
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative walsh's question so if am
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
i understanding from what you're saying
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
that the matrix
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
would be mostly concerned with the
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
what happened to the person
 
01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:00.870 align:start position:0%
what happened to the person
[Music]

01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
sort of at the time of the abuse as
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
sort of damage kind of things in other
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
words you would not have a
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'm just sort of talking off
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but it would not say
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
if that for example if the person if the
 
01:27:19.199 --> 01:27:20.470 align:start position:0%
if that for example if the person if the
victim

01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
victim
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
was na was never able to seek
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh was never able to obtain steady
 
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.189 align:start position:0%
uh was never able to obtain steady
employment

01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know that that adds x
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
x dollars to the claim on the other hand
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
if the victim was able to receive steady
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
employment uh the victim
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a it's a lower amount
 
01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
because i think representative walsh's
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
point is that i mean it seems to me that
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
if if if a victim you know
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
turned out to be uh the next steve jobs
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh we might say that you know it's
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
terrible what happened to you but your
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
damages are x and if if the
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
victim turned out to be like what what
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
what may happen to what we might more
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
typically think of happen to a a victim
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
then the damages should be significantly
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
higher i would think
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i think one of the
 
01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:12.790 align:start position:0%
yeah i think one of the
um

01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
differences between a process like this
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
and and litigation is that that factor
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
is not going to be nearly as heavily
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
weighed i won't say that it might not
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
factor into the arbitrators thinking at
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
all but the alternative process is
 
01:28:27.199 --> 01:28:28.470 align:start position:0%
all but the alternative process is
actually

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
designed such that a steve jobs would
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
still be able to recover
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
based on what had happened to him at the
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
facility and i think that's because of
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
what attorney general uh formella said
 
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:40.790 align:start position:0%
what attorney general uh formella said
that

01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
we don't want to penalize a person um
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
because they've overcome the obstacles
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
that they were presented with we want
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
them to be entitled to recover based on
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
what happened not based on what what
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
they did later in life
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
right no sure i mean i understand see
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know even the steve jobs should get
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
something for having been abused but it
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
i that that that's different than saying
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
that it would you know it would not
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
what happened to the person later on as
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
a result of it would not have
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
any uh any any relationship to how much
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
i i think it
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
i think it certainly would have some
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
relevance my sense is it would it would
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
factor in less than the traditional
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
litigation process and i also think it's
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for us to i think to sit
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
here today and and
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
and speculate as to how much it's going
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
to factor in because i think that that
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
will be the subject of some pretty
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
important negotiations and and
 
01:29:35.199 --> 01:29:36.310 align:start position:0%
important negotiations and and
discussions

01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative edwards made the point
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a point i think we've we've all
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
known but we haven't gotten to in our
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
discussion so far what this
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
what this uh what these guidelines and
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
any value matrix look like are going to
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.239 --> 01:29:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've been at this for uh 90 minutes
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
nine zero and uh i
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
i think we're at a clean point we're
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
about to start line 14 is that right
 
01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.149 align:start position:0%
about to start line 14 is that right
yes

01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm proposing a uh
 
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
eight minute
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
sort of uh recess so that people can you
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
freshen up
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
so we will reconvene
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.679 --> 01:37:04.629 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.639 --> 01:37:05.430 align:start position:0%
 
hey

01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:33.669 align:start position:0%
hey
keith

01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.679 --> 01:37:34.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
in order to make good on my word uh it's
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh 11 36 that's that's about eight
 
01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.709 align:start position:0%
uh 11 36 that's that's about eight
minutes

01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
end the recess on this and uh the house
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
is now in um hearing again on hb 1677.
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
in the fashion of the old western serial
 
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.510 align:start position:0%
in the fashion of the old western serial
movies

01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
movies
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
when we last
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
left our intrepid hero we were on line
 
01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:05.669 align:start position:0%
left our intrepid hero we were on line
14.

01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh line 14 is language on page four at
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
and this is language that
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
was considered
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
and included for recommendation based on
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
a comment that you had representative
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
edwards at the last hearing about
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
have the claimants file under oath and
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
be subject to referral over for for
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh misrepresentation should we also do
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
that with respect to the the
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
perpetrators that we may uncover during
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
this process i would love to say yes but
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
i but i think the better answer to that
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
question is uh only if the claimant
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
requests it
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's the purpose of that change
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah um
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
line 15 uh it's language found at page
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
four lines nine to fifteen
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
um again in response to things raised at
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
the last work session um we have
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
included specific language to make clear
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
that when claimants provide us with a
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
release that does not bar them from
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
continuing to pursue claims against the
 
01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:15.750 align:start position:0%
continuing to pursue claims against the
perpetrators

01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
represent lynn may i just ask a question
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
14. i don't have any problem at all with
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
the language that says a claimant shall
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
not be required to cooperate in a
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
as a condition of participating in the
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
claim process i have no problem with
 
01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.229 align:start position:0%
claim process i have no problem with
that

01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
the earlier sentence though
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
i guess which says that
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
perpetrators of sexual abuse identified
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
by claimants may be referred to an
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate law enforcement agency by
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
the administrator but only with the
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
consent i mean i
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
that strikes me as a
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know i guess i always
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
i was always under the understanding
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the state decided who gets
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and who doesn't not the
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
victim um and so i'm i'm kind of
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
subjecting the state's discretion to the
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
the you know the victims
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
i mean certainly i'm sure the state
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
would take that into account but to say
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
that the victim controls
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
i seems to me to be
 
01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.510 align:start position:0%
i seems to me to be
yep

01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
so um i would just point out that this
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
is a language that refers to the
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
administrator but not to the state
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
nothing here would bar the state from
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
making a determination to prosecute
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
someone and as we're all aware there is
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
an investigation on going uh and so this
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
would just be whether or not the
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
administrator would independently make a
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
referral to the state for that
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
prosecution if the claimant did not wish
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
to do so in other words
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
we don't want to force the victims to
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
participate with the criminal
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
investigation if they simply don't want
 
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.750 align:start position:0%
investigation if they simply don't want
to

01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
just as a part of this process
 
01:40:58.639 --> 01:40:59.669 align:start position:0%
just as a part of this process
okay

01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
and were
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
involvement in this process will be such
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
that we i think we would see any
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
information that the administrator would
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
see that would lead to some
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
determination that there may need to be
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
a criminal review or criminal
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
investigation i don't think the
 
01:41:17.199 --> 01:41:18.470 align:start position:0%
investigation i don't think the
administrator

01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
is going to get information that that
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're you know that you're not aware of
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right so i see your point so
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
the ag designee may take it and pass it
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
over to to
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice bureau but and the
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
criminal justice bureau can decide at
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
that point how to to approach it but the
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
administrator would not have an
 
01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.470 align:start position:0%
administrator would not have an
obligation

01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
on them to make a make a referral or
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
unless the victim consented and wanted
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
so the key sounds like um there there
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
would need to be some kind of a referral
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
do any of you lawyers sense that that
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
referral process needs a mention in this
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
legislation or
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
is it it sounds like representative lin
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
as as long as as the as the attorney
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
general points out
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
as long as the this is not construed to
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
limit the ag's authority to initiate
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
a criminal prosecution and i and it from
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
what you've said i take it you you don't
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
interpret it that way then i'm fine with
 
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:26.709 align:start position:0%
interpret it that way then i'm fine with
it

01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative long i i
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
just i don't want to put you on the spot
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
but you had written a marginal question
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
here in your notes and i just want to
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
make sure if you had a question that we
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
got it addressed
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
we're on uh page four
 
01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:42.550 align:start position:0%
we're on uh page four
um

01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
topic 15 and your notes are on the right
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
it says something like
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yeah the
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
perpetrator it it appears that that
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
would be the case i got my answer thank
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh i think we're ready to go
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
i i think we were ready to move on to
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
number 16 which is language found at
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
page 7
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is an improvement we recommend
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
based on concerns
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
cloak this process completely in secrecy
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
and so we we would recommend that the
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
administrator also include basic
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
information about the nature of the
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
claims that are being made uh in the
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
public disclosure of what's going on at
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
the claim process without identifying
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
any claimant but
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
but the nature of the claims being made
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
so so i think we had a conversation on
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
this uh last time and um
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general has provided an
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
example of the settlement fund award and
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
release which is extremely helpful to to
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
to know what what you're going to
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
make exposable
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
what i had been asking was
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
for a template of the format of the
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
report that would come forward
 
01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.030 align:start position:0%
report that would come forward
but

01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
maybe this is better
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
way to answer my question because this
 
01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:15.830 align:start position:0%
way to answer my question because this
is

01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
i assume this is all the source
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
documentation and any sort of a summary
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
report would just a hundred percent be
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
summarizing these
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
yes i think that's correct in addition
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
to the the financial
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh information about the expenses of the
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the fund
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll withdraw my my request for
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
a template of the report because you've
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh on item
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
17 uh page 8 line 13
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
we've moved up the effective date to the
 
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
date of passage
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh number 18.
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
can we can we um go deeper there i i i
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
think associated with the effective date
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
conversation we also talked about the
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
wisdom of putting a suspense state on
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
this or not a suspense date what am i
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
looking for the the sunset date
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
did you guys think think about or talk
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
about a potential sunset date on this
 
01:45:19.199 --> 01:45:21.189 align:start position:0%
about a potential sunset date on this
legislation

01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
there is there is
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
a provision of the legislation that we
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
would hope uh
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
survived sunset and i think other than
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
that provision we could include it and
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's the provision that talks about
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
once publication is made we would treat
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
that as
 
01:45:36.639 --> 01:45:37.990 align:start position:0%
that as
notice

01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
to the to the community for purposes of
 
01:45:40.639 --> 01:45:41.990 align:start position:0%
to the to the community for purposes of
limitations

01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
so that if someone were to come along
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
and file a claim 10 years from now
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
those claims would be subject to
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
the legal effect of having had notice of
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
your right to bring a claim earlier
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm interpreting that to say that
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
there is a section of the legislation
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
that should survive but the rest of it
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
can be closed down and so for the parts
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
that can be closed down
 
01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
that can be closed down
is

01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
as a legislator i i think there's value
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
in having sort of a self-cleaning
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
attribute to the legislation to remove
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
itself when it's no longer relevant
 
01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:19.910 align:start position:0%
itself when it's no longer relevant
i

01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.629 align:start position:0%
i
i

01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
agree with you and i think we can
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
include that although we haven't yet all
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
should the legislation be removed
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
until such time as the 10 years
 
01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:41.430 align:start position:0%
until such time as the 10 years
of

01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.109 align:start position:0%
of
um

01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know claiming you know paying out
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
the claims
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be the sunset of this
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that you know we don't
 
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
want to sunset the legislation when
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
there's still in fact maybe claims
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
to be paid out through whatever the date
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
was 2032. so that's that's what i took
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
as the sunset date for this for this
 
01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.470 align:start position:0%
as the sunset date for this for this
legislation

01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't disagree i i just would like
 
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the proper way of saying that
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
for us to consider it and put a sunset
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
date on the portions of this
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
law that could be sunset
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
or at whatever point that seems like an
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate date to me
 
01:47:29.679 --> 01:47:34.950 align:start position:0%
appropriate date to me
okay

01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%

01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
no i'm fine okay
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
we want our
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
victim witness advocates to participate
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
in development of the claim
 
01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:02.070 align:start position:0%
in development of the claim
process

01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
and recommend that as a an additional
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
source of input
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
and similarly
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
item 19
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
which is in a couple of places a couple
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
of lines on page five and then
 
01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
a couple of lines on page six again
 
01:48:24.159 --> 01:48:25.270 align:start position:0%
a couple of lines on page six again
uh

01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
we recommend that you include the right
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
of the victims to have an advocate
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
there to support them as they're going
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
item

01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:42.629 align:start position:0%
item
20

01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.639 --> 01:48:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
if i could just just ask a question
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
um in the normal
 
01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.950 align:start position:0%
um in the normal
process

01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
if a person is represented by counsel
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
does the victim witness still get
 
01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.109 align:start position:0%
does the victim witness still get
involved

01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
yes i i think so okay i just
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
i don't have an i i mean this is a good
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
thing i just wanted to make sure that
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
this is not one of those precedent
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
setting things but
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
rather the normal process for this sort
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
of thing i i think they might still have
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
the right to do it even though the
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
language wasn't in the bill
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
but i think it's good to make clear to
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
victims as a part of making sure they
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
understand and are comfortable with the
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
item 20 is at
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
this is an inclusion that came out of
 
01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.109 align:start position:0%
this is an inclusion that came out of
discussions

01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
that we had with the administrator of
 
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:49.510 align:start position:0%
that we had with the administrator of
the

01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:50.390 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
process for the diocese in new york um
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that she stressed was
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
that it was important to victims to be
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
able to sit down face-to-face
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
with the administrator and feel that
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
they had been heard
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
and to do that in a private setting
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
without the attorney general's office
 
01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:09.990 align:start position:0%
without the attorney general's office
present

01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
seemed like a very good idea to the idea
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
to us and we recommend that you include
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
item 21
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
page five lines 8 through 30 is to
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
clarify that the investigator will just
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
serve as a independent fact finder
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
and won't be making
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations for resolution
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with kind of the shift
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill to create a more
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
independent process
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative that's great can you
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
other than this
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
other than the uh
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
the new york example um is is this
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
kind of standard i mean it does strike
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
me to be
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
particularly since the the the victim
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
will have an opportunity if the victim
 
01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:02.310 align:start position:0%
will have an opportunity if the victim
wishes

01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
wishes
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
to testify before the administrator
 
01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.550 align:start position:0%
to testify before the administrator
um

01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
to allow the you know
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
a person who is an adult to have with
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
their counsel sort of an ex parte
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
meeting with the decision maker does
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
seem to me to be
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know a bit unusual and so i'm
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if if this is is there any
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
other examples besides the new york one
 
01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:27.589 align:start position:0%
other examples besides the new york one
um

01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
that administrator has actually
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
administered quite a number of um
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
similar proceedings and it's something
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
that they've incorporated in their
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
process is my understanding
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
across the board i don't know beyond
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
that particular administrator of
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
examples where that's been incorporated
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
it is not consistent with sort of the
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
judicial way of usually resolving claims
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
but since a part of this process is
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
about sort of healing and at the point
 
01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.390 align:start position:0%
about sort of healing and at the point
that

01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
this occurs this individual will not be
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
going to court because there will have
 
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
been a waiver of litigation rights so
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
with all of those considerations and
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
this trying to be an alternate process
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
for these folks um we
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
thought it was in the balance better to
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess one of the other things
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
and this is maybe a bit
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh it goes a bit beyond this particular
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
thing but
 
01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
thing but
um

01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
assumes that
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
there's no question
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
about the claim i mean it's the
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
you know i mean don't get me wrong i'm
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
sure that many of these claims are valid
 
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
claims that should be compensated but i
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
guess i you know
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that we can say that all of
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
them fall into that category and so if
 
01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:51.270 align:start position:0%
them fall into that category and so if
there's

01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a contested case
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
where there's really a cl really a
 
01:52:55.599 --> 01:52:56.550 align:start position:0%
where there's really a cl really a
question

01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
did the abuse occur
 
01:52:58.639 --> 01:52:59.589 align:start position:0%
did the abuse occur
um

01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
to allow the
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
the victim to have a an ex parte
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
stab at the at the judge so to speak it
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm very troubled by that idea so
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't think it would be the only
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
information that the administrator would
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
consider so if there was some question
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
if whether or not the abuse actually
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
occurred that would
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
happen during the the attorney general's
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
office would have an opportunity to
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
participate in and
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
try to
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
elucidate that those issues during a
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
different phase of the claims resolution
 
01:53:37.119 --> 01:53:38.629 align:start position:0%
different phase of the claims resolution
process

01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's to be developed
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
once the administrator is appointed and
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
with all of the parties in consultation
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
so you don't see that in this
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
legislation yet but um
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's i understand your concern um and i
 
01:53:54.239 --> 01:53:55.430 align:start position:0%
it's i understand your concern um and i
i

01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:57.910 align:start position:0%
i think
that

01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
something that absolutely has to be
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
included but it's a recommendation that
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
we think
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
would help victims to feel like they
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to use this process and
 
01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.709 align:start position:0%
want to use this process and
um

01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
that the process helps them to have some
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.070 --> 01:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just add
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
a couple comments to that i think that i
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
definitely see your concern
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative lin that
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know we wouldn't want to set up a
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
situation in which
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
a claimant a victim
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
can have a private conversation with the
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
administrator perhaps tell give the
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
administrator information that the ag
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
designee doesn't know they're alleging
 
01:54:38.159 --> 01:54:39.189 align:start position:0%
designee doesn't know they're alleging
and

01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
and make a case without an opportunity
 
01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:42.950 align:start position:0%
and make a case without an opportunity
for

01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
you know the ag designee to respond
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
right and
 
01:54:48.070 --> 01:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps present an alternative
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
view of what happened i don't think that
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's not the intent of this i mean the
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
intent is to
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
to give
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
the claimant
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
their opportunity to just talk
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
face-to-face with the administrators say
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
what happened to them if this process is
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
working the way it's intended they will
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
already have submitted that information
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
when they submit the claim and so i i
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
think we could probably build in
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
safeguards to ensure that while they get
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
a private face-to-face meeting with the
 
01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:18.070 align:start position:0%
a private face-to-face meeting with the
administrator

01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
to the extent information is conveyed in
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
that meeting that has not been conveyed
 
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
in any other way that information needs
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
to be shared with the ag designee but
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps the administrator could do that
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
i think the point of this is
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
giving it's really about i think what
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
what can be a powerful
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
outlet for victims giving them the
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have the just that
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
private face-to-face meeting with the
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
decision maker but it's not intended i
 
01:55:44.239 --> 01:55:45.109 align:start position:0%
decision maker but it's not intended i
think

01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:46.719 align:start position:0%
as you are concerned with and now that
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned i think it's a legitimate
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
concern that we need to think about it's
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
not intended to to give
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
give a victim
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
a free shot at the judge so to speak and
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
convey information that the the attorney
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
general designee is not going to have an
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to respond to
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up you know i'm just
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
wondering i mean couldn't you since
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
these proceedings are going to be
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
private not you know sort of not open to
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
the public couldn't you accomplish the
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
same thing by having something that
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
would say
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know the the uh
 
01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
the victim shall have an opportunity to
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
personally address
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
the administrator uh at some point
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
during the proceedings but you know that
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
that would be in the presence of the
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:56:28.719 --> 01:56:29.750 align:start position:0%
of the
uh

01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
attorney general's representative
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
so something like that
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's absolutely something we we
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
can think about
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
and because i i see i see the concerns
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
because we're sort of we're trying to
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
create what's
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
in some ways a mediation and arbitration
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
and an administration of claims and it's
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
kind of all in all in one right and so i
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
think in balancing all those you know
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure we balance it
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
correctly and in trying too much to crea
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
create give an outlet we don't give what
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
essentially would be a
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
a competitive advantage in in what is
 
01:57:03.119 --> 01:57:04.229 align:start position:0%
a competitive advantage in in what is
still

01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
at least softly can be an adversarial
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
proceeding if the aeg designee has a
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
different view of the claim than than
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
the claimant
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so representative
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
emmerich and then representative walls
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:18.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
this seems to me to be the grease skid
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
to move
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
every case into the administrator
 
01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:27.430 align:start position:0%
every case into the administrator
uh

01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
and and the claimant
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
are they going to know that the price
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
just went up
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know because if i'm if i'm
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
representing a bunch of people i'm going
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
to say gee you really ought to talk to
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
the administrator
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
i mean and it brings no value to the
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
case but if the if the attorney says you
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
should really talk to the administrator
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
boom 33 and a third percent from 25
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
for one conversation and as a claimant
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
they didn't you didn't tell me that
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
well you didn't read the law okay i i
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
think this is a really bad idea
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for the dollars and cents
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
side now
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
i understand from a human side why this
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
is a good idea but i think you could
 
01:58:11.599 --> 01:58:12.390 align:start position:0%
is a good idea but i think you could
almost

01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
put somebody over in the corner that
 
01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:14.870 align:start position:0%
put somebody over in the corner that
says

01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
the public here here's your chance to
 
01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:18.310 align:start position:0%
the public here here's your chance to
talk

01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
go for it and it doesn't have to be the
 
01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.149 align:start position:0%
go for it and it doesn't have to be the
administrator

01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm saying it could be a
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
cardboard character for crown out loud
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
it just
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is a bad idea
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
for process purposes than financial
 
01:58:31.199 --> 01:58:32.550 align:start position:0%
for process purposes than financial
reasons

01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing your comments and i
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
understand them i think we need to give
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
that some more thought as well um
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
the goal would be to to help the victim
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
with healing but the we need to think
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
about the financial consequences of of
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
having people choose the choose the
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
process in the way you're describing
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the things all my
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
terms my four terms on children and
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
family law and national conference of
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
state legislators sent me out to
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
national conferences
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
teaching me about trauma informed care
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
and trauma-informed processes and what
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing from some of my friends on
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
the committee is
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
a concern that's a very legal concern
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
but doesn't recognize that this is a
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed process and that under a
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed process
 
01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
you need to have some unique things like
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
the victim have the opportunity to speak
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
to the administrator
 
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:26.629 align:start position:0%
to the administrator
and

01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we can't recognize this
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
as a trauma-informed process continue to
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
have that ex-party meeting
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
not have it trigger necessarily go up to
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
a 33 percent i don't think it has to to
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
trigger that i think it's not the same
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
as a full back and forth on behalf of
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
the the lawyers of an advocacy just one
 
01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:46.470 align:start position:0%
the the lawyers of an advocacy just one
meeting

01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
but i think we've got to recognize that
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
very traumatized victims and we need to
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
continue to have a trauma-informed
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
process that has processes that are
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
outside the traditional civil approach
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
to these kinds of things and that that's
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this is that this is
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
a trauma-informed process that allows
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
things that are non-traditional to occur
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a shot at that just
 
02:00:11.679 --> 02:00:12.870 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a shot at that just
first

02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
so representative walls i i i i hear you
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
i share your concern i think the ag
 
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
came in here today with a proposal
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
that was very centered around how to
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
respect the the trauma-informed
 
02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:29.830 align:start position:0%
respect the the trauma-informed
intervention

02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh and and what we're hearing is that
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
there's a another possibility in this
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
world of ours which is that somebody
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
could come up with a
 
02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.350 align:start position:0%
could come up with a
false

02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
false
 
02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:40.390 align:start position:0%
false
accusation

02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
accusation
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
and in that situation if they
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
strictly and completely a moment of
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
quiet with the administrator where they
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
can say pretty much they want
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
whatever they want without challenge
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
that can create
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
an unreasonable risk to the to the state
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
what what i hear what we're asking the
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
ag to go away with is
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
is to just rethink through this how do
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
we maintain the integrity
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the the trauma
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
scenario that we're dealing with while
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
still finding a way to protect
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
the state's interests too and but i i'm
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay with the first priority being
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
worrying about the trauma environment
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
that the victim is in i just i just
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't i just don't want to accidentally
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
give that
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
give an error do well a shield
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
i would agree representative i just
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
didn't want the opportunity for a
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
victim to meet privately with the
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
administrator to disappear because i
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
think that is part of a trauma-informed
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
process i think these victims are going
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
to be totally intimidated by a
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
traditional process and i think that
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
that just as the the
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
mediators and other things have learned
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
that that's an important part of a
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
process when you have these kinds of
 
02:02:02.159 --> 02:02:03.189 align:start position:0%
process when you have these kinds of
victims

02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
victims
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
that's why i wanted to address it
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so now that you've just heard
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
the sidebar do you want to jump into the
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
i think there's a way that we can
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
separate the
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
the um face to face
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh adjudicative process and make both
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
available so that the victim can
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
be heard and have the healing without
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
that triggering the um the economic
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess i mean one of the things
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know i again i i guess where i
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
differ with representative walsh is i
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
we need to recognize that this
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know particularly if you're talking
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
about something that happened a long
 
02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
time ago where the the alleged abuser is
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
no longer is dead or no longer around or
 
02:02:57.199 --> 02:02:58.149 align:start position:0%
no longer is dead or no longer around or
whatever

02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
there is a ripe opportunity for someone
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
who would want to take advantage of the
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
system to take advantage of the system
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be ways to ensure
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen and for example
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
i you know one of the things that i i
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely object to
 
02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
absolutely object to
is

02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
is that on page four
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
the in subsection f the where the
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
where it says claim shall be submitted
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
under oath and shall be presumed to be
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
truthful i would absolutely take that
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
out i mean you know why are why are
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
these claims to be
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
presumed to be truthful any more than
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
any other claims in any other setting it
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
just seems to me
 
02:03:36.719 --> 02:03:37.589 align:start position:0%
just seems to me
um

02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
the claimant i would assume has at least
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
some burden to come in and say and and
 
02:03:45.119 --> 02:03:46.390 align:start position:0%
some burden to come in and say and and
convince

02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
convince
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh the attorney general in the first
 
02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
instance or the administrator eventually
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
that in fact what they say happened
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
actually happened
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
i i i think the
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of that and whether we should
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
do that is for you all to decide based
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
on the discussion you're having right
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
now i can tell you the reason that we
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
included that language was to um
 
02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:15.189 align:start position:0%
included that language was to um
provide

02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:04:15.199 --> 02:04:15.910 align:start position:0%
provide
the

02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
incentive to victims to come forward and
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
to not be concerned
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
that they were going to suddenly
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
be cross-examined and not believed to be
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
truthful and because what we're hearing
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
coming forward with an allegation like
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
this is an extremely difficult process
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
and that the victims need to be treated
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
in the first instance like they are
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
telling the truth that doesn't mean that
 
02:04:40.069 --> 02:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the process we wouldn't
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
discover otherwise but the design of
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
this is in that particular instance
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
leaning towards the more trauma-formed
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
approach but that is
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
that is a a decision for you all too so
 
02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:54.310 align:start position:0%
that is a a decision for you all too so
so

02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
so i would be more comfortable with
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
saying presumption of being truthful
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
with shall be treated with respect and
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
dignity because it seems to me like
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
that's what you're trying to achieve and
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
we don't want to
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
create a
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
legal argument where there doesn't need
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
to be one
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
i think that's an excellent suggestion
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that the presumption
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
does need to be there you're talking
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
about such a power differential here
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about people who were
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
incarcerated they were abused by guards
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
there were no witnesses
 
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
i could believe me any one of those
 
02:05:34.229 --> 02:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
victims can probably tell you in great
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
detail today even if it's 20 or 30 years
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
later exactly what happened to them
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
because it never leaves your mind
 
02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:41.910 align:start position:0%
because it never leaves your mind
and

02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think that when you just make them try
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
to prove everything everything they say
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
they can't they can't because there's no
 
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
witnesses there's nothing there there
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
has to be some sort of recognition that
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
they're not making this out a whole
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
cloth and i think just like any witness
 
02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
on the stand when you question them
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
after a while you get a sense as to
 
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
whether they're lying or they're telling
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
the truth and i think that it's going to
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
become apparent with these witnesses
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
when they come forward and with these
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
great detail of exactly what happened to
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
them that that you're going to know
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
whether they're making it up or whether
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
they're telling what they remember and
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
you know for some of these victims that
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
is the only way that if you understand
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
that you've got to presume it because
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
these guards were very clever they did
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
everything they could to make sure
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
there's no fingerprints
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully i couldn't disagree more i
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
i just think that this is you know this
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
is so we you know take it
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know we we should just we should
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
this just goes you know to take it on a
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
certain app we should presume that
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
whoever said justice kavanaugh you know
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
abused them that we should just presume
 
02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
that what they said is true that's so
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
that's the way we should start it i i
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
just cannot accept that
 
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
just cannot accept that
representative

02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes um
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
i i understand the argument on both
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
sides but the point is
 
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
that we will have
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
investigations of these allegations
 
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's not like
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they say is automatically
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to go forward right i mean
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're investigating it
 
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
and so what i what i
 
02:07:25.589 --> 02:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
think this says
 
02:07:28.229 --> 02:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
is that if you come in
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we will
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
presume that you're telling the truth
 
02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
and then through the investigation
 
02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:36.149 align:start position:0%
and then through the investigation
process

02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
we will determine whether or not you are
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
in fact telling the truth
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
and so this is this i think if i
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
is simply to get the people through the
 
02:07:49.599 --> 02:07:50.790 align:start position:0%
is simply to get the people through the
door

02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
door
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then the investigation
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
will determine
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's true or false just because it's
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
presumed doesn't mean that it's going to
 
02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
move forward it just means that we will
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
accept your
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
allegations and go forward and that's
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer talk but that's
 
02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.470 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer talk but that's
so

02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
so neither of us are lawyers right
 
02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:17.830 align:start position:0%
so neither of us are lawyers right
right

02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
so so i i don't know if that's the
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
second part of what you said is is built
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
into this that whatever is said it will
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
be also subject to
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
the investigation
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and if and if if we get
 
02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
into a hard position where where the
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
presumption of truthfulness is in there
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know i i would just ask for an
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
independent read to
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
to say that initially presumed perhaps
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:51.430 align:start position:0%
subject to
other

02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
factors or qualifications but but but i
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
don't want some administrator to read
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
this and say hey i i have some serious
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
doubt here based on my life experience
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
and my ability to work with people where
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
i don't really believe everything i'm
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
hearing but it says in the law
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
i i have to presume truthfulness and and
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
put more weight on that statement than
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
i think i should so i see
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
you all have heard the conversation and
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
so you know i i'm not going to be
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
resolving it but i i just if you would
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
come back and address this specifically
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
because because i hear representative
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
walls i hear representative lynn and i i
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we're
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
you guys think through it
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
and we will do that thank you i i think
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
we will focus on trying to come up with
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
something that allows for the
 
02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:47.830 align:start position:0%
something that allows for the
um

02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
the truth to be got at during the
 
02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
process but also tries to incentivize
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
people to come in the front door as you
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
look we're we are uh we are almost done
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
so uh number 22 is actually a duplicate
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
of an earlier one i don't think we need
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
to to talk about it again and number 23
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
um is the
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
very small change in language at page
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
seven line 12
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
and it simply takes a a may to a shell
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
so that the administrator
 
02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
will have a requirement to come back and
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
ask for the fund to be expanded if we
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay so um i think this has been great
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
so for the
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's easy for us to know what we just
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:10:47.599 --> 02:10:48.470 align:start position:0%
talked about
but

02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to ask you to do is to to
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
think about this in terms of is there
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
something that you still believe needs
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
to be discussed that weren't in the ag's
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
notes did we overlook something
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know not not because we want to just
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
but just because of the process
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
 
02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go walner and emmerich
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's right i i do have one thing it
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
was actually what's in 23 but i also
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
want to ask before i get to that are we
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
going to hear from attorney
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
i'm never going to say this right
 
02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:22.069 align:start position:0%
i'm never going to say this right

02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
i intend to thank you
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
sorry i will learn how to say his name
 
02:11:26.639 --> 02:11:27.669 align:start position:0%
sorry i will learn how to say his name
um

02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:27.679 --> 02:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
the lawyer in me locked this one caught
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
my eye previously and we have not
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
discussed it in this committee and it
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
says here that there's a requirement
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
that the administrator ask for
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
additional funds but i have been in this
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
legislature long enough to know that
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
just because somebody asks for the funds
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they're going to get it
 
02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:45.350 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they're going to get it
and

02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
in a normal civil proceeding if you win
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
a judgment against the state there's a
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
number of ways to recover you're not
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
limited to a particular fund and i take
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
you back to a little bit of history to
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
when mel thompson was governor
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
and there was a fight with somebody that
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
went all the way to the supreme court
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
that about whether or not you could tape
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
over on your license plate something
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
that said live free or die and the state
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
lost it and the the
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs wanted judgment against
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
the state and governor thompson refused
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
to pay the judgment so what ended up
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
happening was
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
the feds went into the liquor store and
 
02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:21.669 align:start position:0%
the feds went into the liquor store and
said

02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
open the cash register we're taking the
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
money and they immediately called the
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
governor and the governor said call the
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
treasurer whoever he called and said cut
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
the check
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
and the point being is that they had an
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
alternative way of getting the money
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
they weren't limited to a specific fund
 
02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
set up by the legislature
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned that future
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
legislators might choose not to
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
further fund a fund and i'm wondering if
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's a way that we should be putting
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
in here
 
02:12:52.709 --> 02:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
to protect the victims here that they're
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
not dependent on the women of the
 
02:12:56.550 --> 02:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
legislature to fund the fund but that
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
they have a way to recover from the
 
02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
state even if the legislature doesn't
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
fund the fund if they have a valid
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:08.069 --> 02:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
do you think you might have recommended
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
language around that or are you are we
 
02:13:11.669 --> 02:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
going to do what we've been doing and
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
ask the ag to think about it and come
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
back to us
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
um i think it would be very easy to do
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
it there is a provision
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
i don't have it in front of me at the
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
moment but i did notice that there's
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
specific language in here talking about
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
the money coming from the fund i think
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
that language can be
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
easily amended so that you're not
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
limited to the fund so i think the ag i
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
think the plaintiff's lawyer i think
 
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
anybody could i mean
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
again i don't have it right in front of
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
me at the moment but i think it'd be
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
easy in language to amend that you're
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
not limited to the fund
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
i i i'm open to considering it i
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to imagine
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
if we have valid claims against the
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
state the legislature not doing its job
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and appropriating the funds but
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
this is only my third term so you your
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
cynicism may be well received
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
deserved so
 
02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
do do you all have any comment on this
 
02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.189 align:start position:0%
do do you all have any comment on this
discussion

02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think my comment on that that
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
that is one of
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
on a number of these things we would say
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's a decision to be made by
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
you this is i think especially that type
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
of a decision but i still will comment
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
on it
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
i generally would recommend against an
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
open-ended appropriation i think
 
02:14:23.119 --> 02:14:24.830 align:start position:0%
open-ended appropriation i think
institutionally

02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
institutionally
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
um i
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
i think in the day and age we're living
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
in i i don't doubt that our legislature
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
would appropriate funds to pay claims
 
02:14:36.550 --> 02:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
that have gone through a process that's
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
set up that that were that were validly
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
awarded so i guess my general comment is
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
legally i would never recommend to you
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
have an open-ended appropriation and
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
second you know i think institutionally
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
it is better not to presume that the
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
legislature would not
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
um appropriate additional funds for
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
commitments that it made i think it's
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
better to presume that it would
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate additional funds for for
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
commitments that it makes so those are
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
my comments but we're happy to think
 
02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
about this if you would like us to and
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
think about language and and thank you
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
for throwing the word presumption in
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
there a couple of times just to remind
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
us what the word means so
 
02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
us what the word means so
um

02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
did you want to
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
say anything to that or shall we go to
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
represent walnut i'll just say real
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
quick we all know one legislature can't
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
bind a future legislature that's one of
 
02:15:24.790 --> 02:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
those lessons you'll learn if you've
 
02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
been around here more than one term and
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's where this concern comes from is
 
02:15:30.550 --> 02:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
that what we're doing here we are not
 
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
binding future legislators and
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislatures or legislators so that's
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
why i'm thinking that
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
you know we should not be limiting it to
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
the fund that we are funding now
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
because we don't know how this if
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of the economy crashes
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
or something that the legislature is
 
02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
going to go ah we don't feel like using
 
02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
that money right now we're short money
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
all over the place and that's why i
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
don't want to presume that the
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
legislature will
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
given this unknown future decide that
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to fund this and i think
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
that these victims should have the same
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
rights as any
 
02:16:02.719 --> 02:16:03.510 align:start position:0%
rights as any
uh

02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
buddy who has a claim against the state
 
02:16:11.669 --> 02:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
i just have a couple of things that i
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
would like to hear a little bit more
 
02:16:16.079 --> 02:16:17.350 align:start position:0%
would like to hear a little bit more
about

02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:16:20.069 --> 02:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
one of them being
 
02:16:20.079 --> 02:16:21.750 align:start position:0%
one of them being

counsel
 
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.270 align:start position:0%
counsel
would

02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry that the claimant's counsel
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
would have input and
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:51.429 align:start position:0%
instead of
being

02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
more involved at that point can you just
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
you mean that the claimant's counsel
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
would not be more involved or that the
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general would not be able to
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
the claimant's counsel would not be um
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
yeah the
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
it is drafted currently in such a way
 
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
both sides would have to agree
 
02:17:27.270 --> 02:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
to the appointment of an administrator
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
or otherwise the claimant's counsel
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
would simply recommend to their clients
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you i
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
want to hear more about that
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
the other the other part that i can
 
02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:46.150 align:start position:0%
the other the other part that i can
continue

02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
to think about is the physical abuse
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
and claims of people who were
 
02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:55.519 align:start position:0%
physically abused
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
and not um
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
and not just sexually abused
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
have you given any consideration to that
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
we are we are continuing to think about
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
that we haven't made any modifications
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
in these recommendations to you
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
that you're not alone in that concern we
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
have not yet included recommendations
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
that this the scope of this be expanded
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
to include other types of claims because
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
we haven't yet
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
arrived at a at a way to do that
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
within the structure that exists in this
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
a claim of sexual abuse there's just no
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
circumstance in which that is okay and
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
so a presumption of truthfulness and a
 
02:18:41.429 --> 02:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
way of vetting claims for a sexual abuse
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
claim um is is what this bill is
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
currently designed or our
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations to you are currently
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
designed with that approach in mind but
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
when you move into an arena where you
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
have claims of physical abuse or
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse those things can be
 
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
characterized that way but they can also
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
be characterized as activities that
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
happen in a detention facility someone
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
it is a physical environment it is an
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
emotionally difficult environment and so
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
the vetting for those types of claims
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
would would likely look different than
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
this process
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so we are continuing to think about
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
ways we might be able to include those
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
but we haven't yet arrived at a way that
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
we're ready to recommend to you thank
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
you so so
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
so i've thought about this issue about
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
how physical abuse fits into this since
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
the last meeting and knowing that this
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
was important to representative rogers
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
and and the way i've come to view it and
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
please tell me if this is a decent way
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
of looking at it
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
is that we're setting up a very specific
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
program for very specific purpose we
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
know that there's been sexual abuse we
 
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of claims we want a
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
special process to take care of that and
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
within the claims process
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
if there's been physical abuse on top of
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
or in addition to the sexual abuse then
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
that that's an extenuating circumstance
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that can affect what the the payout
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
may be
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
but if it's purely
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
a physical abuse claim
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
we already have structures as i
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
understand it for
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
those claims to be filed in the ordinary
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
course of business
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so it isn't that we're saying that
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
we don't care about physical abuse only
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
we're just saying that that
 
02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
is outside of the scope of this special
 
02:20:31.359 --> 02:20:32.710 align:start position:0%
is outside of the scope of this special
program

02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
is that is that reasonable
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
yes it is i think the way this is
 
02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
currently drafted it includes exactly
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
in one version of this we have many
 
02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:55.270 align:start position:0%
in one version of this we have many
versions

02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
versions
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
it said to the effect that the
 
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
cases or the
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs will be taken in the order in
 
02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
which it's received
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
my only comment on that was to say if
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's complete
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
because it was quite a bit of verbage
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
about having a completed file so you got
 
02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:14.710 align:start position:0%
about having a completed file so you got
to

02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
modify we'll take them in the order
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
they're received
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
completed completed and
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
received you know what i'm trying to say
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise somebody gives you an imp
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
they're third in the door but it's they
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
give you 10 of the information they
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
start screaming you can't you can't
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
go to number four i'm number three
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
so i i do understand what you're saying
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
and if that's still unclear we'll we'll
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
work on that yeah i can't find it in the
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:44.469 --> 02:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
yes this is easy
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
page

02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
6 7
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
line 29
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
um it says that
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
the administrator
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
shall annually submit a report
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
um i would like to say that i would
 
02:22:10.479 --> 02:22:11.910 align:start position:0%
um i would like to say that i would
anticipate

02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal committee would like
 
02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal committee would like
this

02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
but would like it more than annually
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:22:22.319 --> 02:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
and so
so

02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know i would
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
i would suggest
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
that we at least go to quarterly
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i say that be just because of what
 
02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative wallace was talking about
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to know when we are coming
 
02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:42.150 align:start position:0%
that we need to know when we are coming
close

02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
close
 
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar figure
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll probably not get
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
other than cursorary looked at
 
02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
other than cursorary looked at
until

02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
or more
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
but we need to have the background for
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
that so if we could just
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
change that a little bit
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
we can include that do you have um
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
a concern if we start that a little bit
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
of the way into the process in the early
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
phase it's going to be all about design
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
right no no that's you know i don't care
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
when you know but okay i just i just
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
feel that we need to be able to track
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
with the physical committee
 
02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:28.479 --> 02:23:29.190 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
so i agree with that quarterly issue and
 
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
and maybe in year five we can drop it to
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
some other rate but but certainly in the
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
initial phase um earlier we had talked
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
about a conversation having the matrix
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the joint legislative fiscal
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee of course i meant the
 
02:23:50.309 --> 02:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
executive council too i didn't mean that
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
that standard process of of how we do
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
that is what i intended i didn't mean to
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
ignore the executive council and
 
02:23:58.240 --> 02:23:59.590 align:start position:0%
ignore the executive council and
governor

02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
02:24:03.429 --> 02:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
that that should go to the executive
 
02:24:03.439 --> 02:24:04.790 align:start position:0%
that that should go to the executive
council

02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
the matrix that's not that's not part of
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
their role is it yeah i i
 
02:24:14.230 --> 02:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
i do i've seen other legislation where
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
something has to come back before the
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to be approved um i
 
02:24:20.309 --> 02:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
think this is the type of instance where
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't necessarily go to the
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
governor and council
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
and i i i say this and i think the
 
02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
governor would probably agree with me so
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get out in front of him
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
but even though he's a client you know
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
that would set up a a situation which
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
the governor alone when something has to
 
02:24:39.429 --> 02:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
go to governor and council the governor
 
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
alone can
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
can can stop it right you know so you're
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's one person and the executive
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
council will not have been nearly as
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with all of these discussions i
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
mean this
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
and and what went into crafting the
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
legislation so it's typically a fiscal
 
02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
committee and governor and council
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
process for
 
02:24:58.640 --> 02:24:59.910 align:start position:0%
process for
um

02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
for for spending money and this is
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
spending money but
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's not as if each individual claim is
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
coming through to be approved it's just
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
the general guidelines and so i
 
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's ultimately up to you but i do think
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
this is a situation which if you didn't
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
include the governor and council i don't
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
think that would seem like uh
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
an unusual omission it would it would
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually seem unusual i think to submit
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
something like this to the governor and
 
02:25:25.359 --> 02:25:26.630 align:start position:0%
something like this to the governor and
council

02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the education and the grace
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
that which you just both told me that
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's okay i withdraw my comment
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
i had another thing that occurred to me
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
that we did not discuss yet today and
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
that is is the 1.5 million dollar cap
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
still in this legislation
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
so given the more recent
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
settlements and the more recent cases
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
that involve sexual abuse like the larry
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
nassar cases and the size of the
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
settlements and judgments in some of
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
these more recent cases
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
i i think we should revisit that and we
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
should be looking at a broader selection
 
02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:12.230 align:start position:0%
should be looking at a broader selection
of

02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know what what are the recent um
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
settlements and those kinds of things
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that should be incorporated
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
into that and we should re-examine
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether 1.5 million really is the right
 
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.429 align:start position:0%
whether 1.5 million really is the right
cap

02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
cap
 
02:26:26.070 --> 02:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
before you answer i i i feel obligated
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
to let the people who have been waiting
 
02:26:30.469 --> 02:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
patiently for
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
a house bill 103.
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
i i think we're going to have to
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
postpone the hearing on that i'm sorry
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
we've got several people that in the
 
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
brain trust here that require a 12 45
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
hard break
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
and uh and we still have a couple of
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
people to hear on this bill so so if
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
you're one of the patient ones uh you
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative waltz
 
02:26:58.469 --> 02:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
i think to that i would just say to keep
 
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
it short we're
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think we have been and we remain open
 
02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:04.469 align:start position:0%
i think we have been and we remain open
to

02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
reviewing additional um data that might
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
in consideration of whether to to
 
02:27:11.429 --> 02:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
increase that cap
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
we've done our own research and i i
 
02:27:14.469 --> 02:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
still feel
 
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
pretty strongly that that 1.5 million is
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
an appropriate cap but we we have
 
02:27:19.439 --> 02:27:20.630 align:start position:0%
an appropriate cap but we we have
invited

02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
invited
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council to to provide us
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
with additional verdict research or
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
settlement research on that front we we
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
have yet to receive that to this state
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
but we're happy to to look at that if
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's provided but i think based on the
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
research we've done and we're certainly
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
open to reviewing other research we
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
remain confident that 1.5 million is the
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:46.319 --> 02:27:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:27:51.270 --> 02:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
did did you have comments i i we had a
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
hallway conversation about the 1.5
 
02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:56.830 align:start position:0%
hallway conversation about the 1.5
million

02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
cap i think it's what it should be for
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
the time being yes that's what you were
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
referring to that conversation all right
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
i just didn't want your comments left
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
out um
 
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that we're going to
 
02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
resolve that today um if if if you
 
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind sticking around
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
we have um the plaintiff's attorney
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
the last name apparently is so hard to
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
pronounce that i'm just going to invite
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
you to come up because you know who you
 
02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:26.550 align:start position:0%
you to come up because you know who you
are

02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
and and i
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'm gonna give you like at
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
least five minutes to just riff and do
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
whatever you want
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
and then if you but i would like you
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
before you end i would like you to stick
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
your finger in specific parts of where
 
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
we are with 1677
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
and tell us if you are
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
if you have a disagreement that the
 
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
public should know about
 
02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh and then represent shapiro hands up
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
so what i have to do for procedure is i
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
have to open the hearing on hb 103 and
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
then immediately i'll be putting us into

02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
last name i will again thank you or
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh my name is

representative edwards uh my name is
david

02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
david
 
02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:49.670 align:start position:0%
david
vissinanzo

02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
n v-i-c-i-n-a n z o
 
02:29:55.270 --> 02:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i am uh used to spelling it 10 15
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
times a day so
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
ever since i started working
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's actually phonetic but it's it's a
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
difficult when you look at it
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be able to do quite
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
what you've invited me to do
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative edwards today i i can't
 
02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
go through and
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
it would we don't have the time we don't
 
02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i but i can tell you that we have
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
been doing that with
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
john framela and and with jennifer
 
02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:22.790 align:start position:0%
john framela and and with jennifer
ramsey

02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
ramsey
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
and we you know especially in the last
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
week have
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
had some very productive conversations
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
in my view
 
02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
our court for the next draft and then we
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
are going to turn it around as quickly
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
as we can with a more comprehensive red
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
line we did do a red line
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
but it was so comprehensive that nobody
 
02:30:42.070 --> 02:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
could follow it uh you were careful
 
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
lawyers and we got lots of ideas
 
02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
probably too many
 
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm not able really today and i
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
understand that there will be another
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the future but i think
 
02:30:52.950 --> 02:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
today is premature and it really will
 
02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:53.990 align:start position:0%
today is premature and it really will
take

02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
longer than we have what i want to do
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
though is focus on
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
the three three core principles
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
that uh we believe and we think the
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
experts believe
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
are essential to a
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
productive and successful and effective
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh and fair
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
settlement process and it really boils
 
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
down to and we've talked to many experts
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
jennifer ramsey has as well and john
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
and we're learning and i've learned a
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
lot because i've done hundreds of these
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
mostly in the form of mediations
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
involving historical child sexual abuse
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
cases so i have a good feel for how they
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
work and i have a couple of
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
words at the end i'd really like to
 
02:31:36.389 --> 02:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
address some things that justice lynn
 
02:31:36.399 --> 02:31:37.270 align:start position:0%
address some things that justice lynn
said

02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry justice lynn it's a force of
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
habit i'm not sure i'm ever going to
 
02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
lose that habit
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
um but the three core principles that
 
02:31:46.150 --> 02:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
the experts agree
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
are essential to a fair and a
 
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
fair process that can be
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
fairly described as victim-friendly and
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
trauma informed
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
including all the child victims in the
 
02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:02.870 align:start position:0%
including all the child victims in the
process

02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
i know that there are ways you can divvy
 
02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
them up and you can
 
02:32:09.190 --> 02:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
segregate half or more of them and say
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
no you're not invited you can do that i
 
02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
know there are legal distinctions and
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
there are technical distinctions
 
02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:16.790 align:start position:0%
there are technical distinctions
but

02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
what victims hear is that
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
my trauma
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
is not as important as other people's
 
02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:24.630 align:start position:0%
is not as important as other people's
trauma

02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
trauma
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
my trauma that has so severely affected
 
02:32:29.910 --> 02:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
my life is given a lesser priority and
 
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
no matter no matter no matter all the
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
words we might say to try to mitigate
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
that and explain why well there are
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
legal differences and so forth they're
 
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
not they're not going to hear that and
 
02:32:41.349 --> 02:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
frankly i don't want to be the one i
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
will not be the one to deliver that
 
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
message to them i'm not going to say
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
that i am in favor
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
of discriminating against some victims
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
in favor of other victims i just don't
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
think that it's a good idea and i think
 
02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's a bad thing for the state to do
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think the state wants that
 
02:32:57.760 --> 02:32:58.950 align:start position:0%
i don't think the state wants that
perception

02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
perception
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to track along with what
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
because what i what i think i'm hearing
 
02:33:06.640 --> 02:33:07.429 align:start position:0%
because what i what i think i'm hearing
is

02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
in processing is that
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
the ag from my perspective and and
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
attorney ramsey have have done
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
a good job they're not done yet but
 
02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
they've they've done a good job of
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that the the trauma-informed
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
respect is included in this
 
02:33:27.910 --> 02:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
and and i'm hearing though that you may
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
not accept that that's true and and we
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
have language for you to look at for
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
that and then as you're talking about
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
respecting all victims
 
02:33:38.230 --> 02:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
again my perception is that we're doing
 
02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:42.230 align:start position:0%
again my perception is that we're doing
that

02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:44.469 --> 02:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh and if you don't
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
i just need you to be really clear
 
02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
like i i need to know your position on
 
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
um the uh the physical abuse
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
being a carve out and being left to the
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
standard i'm very happy to do that all
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
right all right first i want to and i
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
hate to interrupt sort of your you know
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
overview because i know that's i
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate it it's a good way to kind of
 
02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
cut to the chase and actually
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
clarify the message but thank you i
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to say i i absolutely do agree
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
that john
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
and jen ramsey are trying very hard to
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
make it a trauma informed process i
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
believe that but for all of us it's an
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
education this is not an area that we're
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
all born knowing
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
for me it was a very much an education
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
20 years ago when i was thrown into the
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
middle of the church crisis
 
02:34:32.469 --> 02:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
and i've been one way or another been
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
involved ever since generally
 
02:34:37.349 --> 02:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
you might say the defense side but i've
 
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
never viewed it as plain of defense i've
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
viewed it more as a collaborative
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
process to achieve justice and fairness
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
for everybody involved and hopefully
 
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
some measure of reconciliation between
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
people who are tremendously harmed and
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
the institutions that did the harm but
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's a process we have to learn
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
um i i do i've been speaking to
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
one of the uh preeminent experts on
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
child especially adolescent trauma his
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
name is david finkelhor and he is right
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
here at unh
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
been doing this for 50 years since he
 
02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
got his p 45 years since he
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
got his phd at harvard and is
 
02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
very much a national nationally
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
recognized expert on the subject what
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
he's told me is that his research
 
02:35:22.319 --> 02:35:23.429 align:start position:0%
he's told me is that his research
indicates

02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
indicates
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
that as bad as sexual trauma is for an
 
02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:27.030 align:start position:0%
that as bad as sexual trauma is for an
adolescent

02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
adolescent
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
violent trauma is worse
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
and even worse than sexual and violent
 
02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
trauma is emotional trauma and he says
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
it seems kind of counterintuitive but
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's true
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
and of course in our case here the
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
emotional trauma there's a lot of
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
emotional trauma usually it's attached
 
02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
to physical or sexual occasionally it
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
happens without the physical without the
 
02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
sexual and that would be the instance in
 
02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:50.150 align:start position:0%
sexual and that would be the instance in
which

02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
kids were confined
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
a month at a time
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes two three four months at a
 
02:35:58.469 --> 02:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
time in a cell without a human contact
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's the worst kind of trauma but
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's being excluded from this bill
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
i i know that it's that's it's a it's
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
maybe a little tougher to um
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
to wrestle with because it's not such a
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
bright line the way sexual abuse is
 
02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
everybody knows sexual abuse is off
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
limits and yes there may be times when
 
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
certain amounts of confinement might be
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate and it might depend whether
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
it's the 70s or the 80s or 90s in which
 
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
our understanding of of what was
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for adolescents was at the
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
time or what the policies were but we
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
could wrestle through that in this
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
process there's no reason that the right
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
administrator with the right guidance
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
can't handle all the victims and i think
 
02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
the state has a tremendous incentive to
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
do it first we don't want to
 
02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:40.870 align:start position:0%
do it first we don't want to
discriminate

02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
child victims are child victims they all
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
suffered and they're still suffering
 
02:36:44.479 --> 02:36:45.429 align:start position:0%
suffered and they're still suffering
today

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
um and the other incentive is
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're filing lawsuits too and
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
do we want to get do we want to get a
 
02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
process that's going to work here that's
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
going to be attractive to the victims
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
and and successful so that in a year
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
from now we can say that we've done the
 
02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
right thing and we're starting to put
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
this in the rear view mirror or do we
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
want to allow the litigation to clog our
 
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
courts for the next two three four years
 
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
and a constant stream
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
of news reports about you know
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
what the allegations are and what the
 
02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
latest thing in the litigation is
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't think the state wants that i
 
02:37:21.030 --> 02:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
really think the state has a tremendous
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to actually deal with
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
this in a in a victim-centered and uh
 
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
fair way that accounts for all the human
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
suffering that unfortunately was
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
inflicted or at least allowed to be
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
inflicted may i interact with you on
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
this yes okay um
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
are are you are you telling us
 
02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:42.230 align:start position:0%
are are you are you telling us
that

02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
if there were
 
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
a juvenile that had been subjected to
 
02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:48.150 align:start position:0%
a juvenile that had been subjected to
[Music]

02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
unreasonable solitary confinement over a
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
prolonged period of time yes that that
 
02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:55.990 align:start position:0%
prolonged period of time yes that that
individual

02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
today and in the past
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
has had
 
02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:01.110 align:start position:0%
has had
no

02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
or inadequate access to
 
02:38:07.270 --> 02:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
having their case uh receive justice are
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
you are they are they excluded from the
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
today's process and current process
 
02:38:15.359 --> 02:38:16.389 align:start position:0%
today's process and current process
uh

02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
well they're they're excluded from this
 
02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.110 align:start position:0%
well they're they're excluded from this
bill

02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
is that what you meant yes no no i mean
 
02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
we have a a system where people can
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
apply and
 
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
and go through a settlement process with
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
the ag and and i just want to make sure
 
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
that in the earlier uh discussion i had
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
i think it was rep attorney ramsey who
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
confirmed my understanding is that
 
02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh the physical abuse is an extenuating
 
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
circumstance within this bill
 
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
but that cases that are strictly
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
physical abuse
 
02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:51.990 align:start position:0%
physical abuse
would

02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
remain the province of the standard
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
procedures and so as i'm listening to
 
02:38:57.359 --> 02:38:58.309 align:start position:0%
procedures and so as i'm listening to
your

02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony and i'm sorry to
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
interrupt but we're starting to run out
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
of time
 
02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:03.510 align:start position:0%
of time
is

02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure
 
02:39:05.359 --> 02:39:06.389 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure
that

02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
we aren't
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
leaving here thinking
 
02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
that those who kids who have been
 
02:39:15.429 --> 02:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
physically abused or or unreasonably
 
02:39:18.230 --> 02:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in solitary confinement
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
know i i don't i just don't want it to
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
be the case that we don't have
 
02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
a process set up now already for them to
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
go through well the only process i'm
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
aware of is the judicial system
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
that that's that's all that exists and
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these cases do involve
 
02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh those are emotional uh distress
 
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
emotional uh torture
 
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
confinement physical abuse okay broken
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
ribs so your
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
your position is that that's inadequate
 
02:39:51.990 --> 02:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's there but it's inadequate and we
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
need to roll it into this uh this
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
special bill i i well i like the word
 
02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
inadequate yeah i what i what i would
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
say is
 
02:40:02.469 --> 02:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
phrasing more positively is this is a
 
02:40:04.389 --> 02:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
great opportunity to take care of all of
 
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
those in an expedited fashion there is
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
there is a way to bake into the matrix
 
02:40:11.670 --> 02:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
and into the process of the
 
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
administrator that you can account for
 
02:40:15.910 --> 02:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
the differences between sexual assault
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
and physical assault and illegal
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
confinement and so forth
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
all the arguments will be made by the
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office there may be
 
02:40:26.309 --> 02:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
mitigating or extenuating circumstances
 
02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
in some of those cases but that can all
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
be baked into the process and you it's
 
02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
so important that we get an
 
02:40:31.279 --> 02:40:32.469 align:start position:0%
so important that we get an
administrator

02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
who is wise and very familiar with new
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire law has a lot of experience
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
with this and is trusted by everybody
 
02:40:40.469 --> 02:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
and that's the kind of person that will
 
02:40:40.479 --> 02:40:41.349 align:start position:0%
and that's the kind of person that will
say

02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
well i i hear what you're saying
 
02:40:45.269 --> 02:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh that you were confined for three
 
02:40:47.349 --> 02:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
months and you did you and you couldn't
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
con you couldn't even talk to your
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
parents and
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
and you didn't talk to anybody
 
02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
i didn't mean to like lead your
 
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
testimony too much okay but i i re we
 
02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
really have a hard stop at 12 45 and and
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
your conversation with us
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
has clarified the issue that we need to
 
02:41:07.110 --> 02:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
think about we think so
 
02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
encompass everybody we don't want to
 
02:41:10.309 --> 02:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
discriminate against any of the victims
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
yes sir i respect that opinion and we're
 
02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
continuing that conversation with the ag
 
02:41:16.309 --> 02:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
you mentioned there were three things
 
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
and i think you just did one i did one
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
and the second one is somewhat related
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
and that is that we are uh very very um
 
02:41:26.150 --> 02:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's very important to us that the
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
administrator be
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
truly independent
 
02:41:29.439 --> 02:41:31.670 align:start position:0%
truly independent
and

02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
we've consulted with numerous national
 
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
experts who say that's standard you you
 
02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
would never appoint cardinal law to
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
administer the boston archdiocese
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
claim settlement process because nobody
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
would use it nobody would trust it and
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
certainly it has to be can't be the ag
 
02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
that is going to be
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
settling claims with victims who think
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
that the state is what or know that the
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
state is is the source of the harm and
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
that john is the representative of the
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
state it just doesn't work i i it has to
 
02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
be separated from the ag
 
02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
and i think very simple tweak in the
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
bill would be
 
02:42:10.630 --> 02:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general and the clan
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
the cl and the victims would agree
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
on who the administrator was because who
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
it is is going to be very very important
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
as i said somebody truly independent
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
somebody viewed as wise fair prudent and
 
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
very experienced and who's probably had
 
02:42:27.030 --> 02:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of experience at discerning
 
02:42:29.349 --> 02:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
what's nonsense and what's not you know
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
what's fair and what's not so so if i
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
may i i want to continue to sharpen the
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
edge here yes um
 
02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:36.710 align:start position:0%
edge here yes um
so

02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:39.910 --> 02:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
um honest on a separation argument
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
we have a separation of time
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
because we're going back to
 
02:42:49.030 --> 02:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
it had been 1980 now it's just at any
 
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
time so there's a separation of time
 
02:42:54.309 --> 02:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
there's also a separation of department
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
the the the ag's office is fundamentally
 
02:43:00.309 --> 02:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
different than the ydc in terms of their
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
mission and their personnel yes and so
 
02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
so one could argue that there is
 
02:43:08.790 --> 02:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
separation but i think you're saying it
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
that it's inadequate
 
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
i am it's it's inadequate i do
 
02:43:14.710 --> 02:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
understand the separation and and so
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
forth but
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
my clients don't
 
02:43:19.269 --> 02:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
they see it as all one state and they
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
think well that's the lawyer for the
 
02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
state uh isn't he obliged to get the
 
02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
best deal for the state in every case
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i think he is
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
under the rules of professional conduct
 
02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:29.590 align:start position:0%
under the rules of professional conduct
and

02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:31.269 --> 02:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
if it's not separated from him they're
 
02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
not going to trust the result so they
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
won't participate so so i want to let
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
you know i know that i'm not being fair
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
to you and so the next time we come up
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
you're you're going to go first we're
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
going to hear 103 and then you're going
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
to go first okay so i want that and and
 
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
and and will fully respect your time i
 
02:43:50.309 --> 02:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just pounding towards the 12 45 and
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
you've got .3.3 is we don't want to
 
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
strip the victims of choices unduly and
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
what this bill still does is say that
 
02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
you have to waive your judicial rights
 
02:44:04.950 --> 02:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
as a price of admission to this process
 
02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to do that you do so
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
you you're not going to get people to do
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
that who will say all right i give them
 
02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
my right to sue
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
now i enter the process i have no no
 
02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
idea first i'm not even sure the
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
administrator is independent second i
 
02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
have no idea what if i what the award
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
or if even if i'll get an award and
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're asking me to waive my only
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
leverage before i enter the process
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's not going to work they're not
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to do that and they shouldn't be
 
02:44:31.750 --> 02:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
forced to do that they should be
 
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
required to waive it once they are aware
 
02:44:35.830 --> 02:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
of the ward and they decide to take it
 
02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
and issue a release to the state for all
 
02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:38.710 align:start position:0%
and issue a release to the state for all
claims

02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
claims
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
so as long as i'm on record of being
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
unfair to you i i'd like to take like 30
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
seconds of your remaining time and give
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
it to the attorney general either to him
 
02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:48.469 align:start position:0%
it to the attorney general either to him
or

02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
attorney ramsey to just respond come up
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
to the and respond
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
to the issue
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
that is being presented that we are
 
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:01.830 align:start position:0%
in this bill
denying

02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
denying
 
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
standard judicial rights expected
 
02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
judicial rights whatever the right term
 
02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:17.510 align:start position:0%
judicial rights whatever the right term
is

02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
so the way jennifer ramsey for the
 
02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
record for the the way that this bill is
 
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
is structured and the current
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations to you still include
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
claimant would need to select into the
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
process and would waive the right to
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
continue to pursue litigation
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
in order to choose to participate
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
instead in this alternative resolution
 
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
process and that that would happen at
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
the beginning the participation in the
 
02:45:47.429 --> 02:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
process is entirely voluntary so if a
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
victim wishes to pursue litigation
 
02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
instead of this process
 
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
that is still an option for them
 
02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that opting um
 
02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
for acceptance of the process and not
 
02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
additional litigation that that's kind
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
of normal in an arbitration environment
 
02:46:07.510 --> 02:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
is or is that just a bad analogy no
 
02:46:10.150 --> 02:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's a good analogy and and in fact we
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
have included some references to the
 
02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
arbitration statute for that reason um
 
02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
it is important not for this process to
 
02:46:19.349 --> 02:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
just be
 
02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
um a waste of state resources
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
for a claimant to go through it get to
 
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
the end decide they don't like the
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
result and then proceed on with
 
02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:29.429 align:start position:0%
result and then proceed on with
litigation

02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
02:46:31.269 --> 02:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so
 
02:46:32.810 --> 02:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
please uh continue and
 
02:46:32.820 --> 02:46:33.910 align:start position:0%
please uh continue and

02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
there may be a number of ways to address
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
it what we want to make sure is that
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
our claimants are putting their best
 
02:46:42.389 --> 02:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
foot forward and not waiving what
 
02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
may be their only chance it's some kind
 
02:46:46.630 --> 02:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
of recompense for the suffering they've
 
02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:47.670 align:start position:0%
of recompense for the suffering they've
endured

02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
endured
 
02:46:49.590 --> 02:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
um it's a big risk for them to enter a
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
process about which they have no idea
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
what the result will be
 
02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
maybe if as we develop the matrix maybe
 
02:46:58.389 --> 02:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
as we have more security about who the
 
02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
administrator is and whether or not
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a level of trust
 
02:47:03.429 --> 02:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
in the administrator and in the matrix
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
and the process perhaps we could talk
 
02:47:07.349 --> 02:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
more about that and we we will continue
 
02:47:09.349 --> 02:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
talking more can i have one more point
 
02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
before i i quit i want to address uh
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
justice lynn of course had many
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
many very cogent comments but there was
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
one in particular and i think everybody
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
here would would probably
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
take some comfort in knowing it
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
it goes back to cooperation with the
 
02:47:26.790 --> 02:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
criminal case
 
02:47:28.630 --> 02:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
i of course
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
applaud what the attorney general is
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
doing with the criminal investigation
 
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's long overdue i will say that the
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
reason the criminal investigation began
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
is because my co-counsel russ riley
 
02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
brought his first client david meehan in
 
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
to meet with gordon mcdonald
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
before anything else happened and said
 
02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:46.950 align:start position:0%
before anything else happened and said
gordon

02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
gordon
 
02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:47.670 align:start position:0%
gordon
that

02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
my guy is credible and truthful and he's
 
02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
telling you that terrible things happen
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
at ydc and it was widespread and there
 
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
were a lot of people involved and a lot
 
02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
of victims not just him so what we have
 
02:48:00.070 --> 02:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
done ever since then and of course
 
02:48:02.389 --> 02:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
gordon to his credit took it and ran
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
with it gordon of obviously someone i
 
02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
have tremendous respect for my partner
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
for 17 years tremendous guy with
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
tremendous integrity and i
 
02:48:13.190 --> 02:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
i think he's done state a great service
 
02:48:16.150 --> 02:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
by by opening this up for public viewing
 
02:48:17.830 --> 02:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that it will never happen
 
02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:18.630 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that it will never happen
again

02:48:18.630 --> 02:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
so much to learn here but what we have
 
02:48:22.630 --> 02:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
done ever since and we have 500 clients
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
now we have asked each one of our
 
02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
clients after we do the initial
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
interview with them
 
02:48:30.070 --> 02:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
and find out what happened we asked them
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
all to go to the state police and be
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
interviewed by the state police and we
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't require them we don't make them
 
02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
because we want victims to have options
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
not a single one has refused us
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
every one of our clients has been
 
02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
interviewed by the state police now we
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
don't have access to those interviews
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
because the criminal and the civil
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
processes are totally separate and jen
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
ramsey doesn't have access to those
 
02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
interviews nobody does right now but i
 
02:48:55.429 --> 02:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
want you to know that that's part of our
 
02:48:57.190 --> 02:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
vetting process and
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
and it and and it's also a testament to
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
how much we support the state's efforts
 
02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
in that criminal investigation every one
 
02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
of our folks has been interviewed by the
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
state police and also offers a layer of
 
02:49:09.910 --> 02:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
extra protection because of course if
 
02:49:11.190 --> 02:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
you're not candid with the state police
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of legal
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
consequences so you better be right and
 
02:49:16.230 --> 02:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
you better be telling the truth
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
and we tell them all that and they
 
02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
they know what the risks are and not a
 
02:49:22.150 --> 02:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
single one of us has refused us they've
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
all been interviewed by the state police
 
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it with that
 
02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
so let let me ask you a question um
 
02:49:32.550 --> 02:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
we we would like to continue this
 
02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
conversation on the 24th of february
 
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh we'll probably start this hearing at
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
like 10 45 at 11 o'clock that we're
 
02:49:44.309 --> 02:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
going to hear 103 first
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and and you'll you'll lead off
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
what what uh what i'm going to ask you
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
is is that enough time for you to think
 
02:49:56.389 --> 02:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
that you and the ag office can get to
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
the point where
 
02:49:58.399 --> 02:49:59.110 align:start position:0%
the point where
you

02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
we don't need to talk about the things
 
02:50:03.510 --> 02:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
that you agree to agree on but the
 
02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
things where you have not come into
 
02:50:05.439 --> 02:50:06.790 align:start position:0%
things where you have not come into
agreement

02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:50:10.230 --> 02:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
we we really could use a very precise
 
02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:11.349 align:start position:0%
we we really could use a very precise
sharp

02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
sharp
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
to the point description of
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
that position versus this position so
 
02:50:20.230 --> 02:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
that so that we know what sort of issue
 
02:50:22.309 --> 02:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
that we need to decide on yes i
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and that date would be
 
02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
fine school vacation is the next week
 
02:50:27.670 --> 02:50:27.680 align:start position:0%

is there anyone on the panel that still
 
02:50:49.590 --> 02:50:49.600 align:start position:0%

and with that i'm going to open
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
02:51:27.269 --> 02:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
i i did not think it was going to take
 
02:51:31.349 --> 02:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
this but i i having done it i think it
 
02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
needed to be
 
02:51:35.910 --> 02:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
so so pat i just realized what we did
 
02:51:38.309 --> 02:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
not do
 
02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
we did not
 
02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:40.630 align:start position:0%
we did not
take

02:51:40.630 --> 02:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:51:43.110 --> 02:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
kathy rogers comments
 
02:52:17.190 --> 02:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
