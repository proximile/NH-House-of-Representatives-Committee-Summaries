hour I will I
 
00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
am I will call this sub committee work
 
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
session to
 
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.550 align:start position:0%
session to
order

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
um this the subject
 
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
is HB
 
00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
159 uh relative to default service rate
 
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
for electricity and energy procurement
 
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
plan in the department of energy and
 
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
there is an
 
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that is being
 
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.990 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that is being
proposed

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 align:start position:0%
um who did you proposed this amendment
 
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
the 0557 H um yes 0557 H was the
 
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
February Amendment that's correct okay
 
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to that uh I mean
 
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
first or actually we need a motion we
 
00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 align:start position:0%
need a motion to accept the
 
00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm taking minutes as well as
 
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%
trying to run the
 
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 align:start position:0%
meeting um so now discussion on this
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
amendment in light of of
 
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
what other things have happened this
 
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.270 align:start position:0%
what other things have happened this
since

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
February sure um I think just for a
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
little bit of history and background on
 
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 159 the intent here is to
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
come up with a strategy to allow um our
 
00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
utilities to procure Energy Services
 
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
more than twice a year more than every
 
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
six months um very similar to when we
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
talk about in an Investment Portfolio
 
00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
where you want to be able to have both
 
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
short and long-term Investments at
 
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
different levels of risk to then even
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
out a portfolio so even if the market is
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
not doing great your Investments should
 
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
still stay steady because you have a
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
good mix in a similar way we're looking
 
00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 align:start position:0%
at coming up with a solution for
 
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
electricity so that we can have our
 
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
electric rates stay steady with a
 
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
investment mix of both short and
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
long-term cost procurement right now
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is just a
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
six-month procurement timeline which
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have seen and many of
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
our constituents have felt uh where we
 
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
had crazy leaps in cost for electricity
 
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh due to obviously some international
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
issues cost of natural gas uh volatility
 
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the Market but nonetheless that
 
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
really hurts our constituents because
 
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
they can't plan for especially
 
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%
businesses but also U homeowners
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's pocketbook is hit you can't
 
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
plan for a long-term Financial impacts
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
if you don't know how things are going
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
to be and so rather than having these
 
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
jumps up and down and the volatility the
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
goal of House Bill 159 was to come up
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
with a strategy of laddering so that we
 
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
would have more consistent electric
 
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
rates and I want to say for the record
 
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
to be super clear the goal was not to
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
have cheaper necessarily the goal was to
 
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
have consistent reliable and something
 
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
that people can Budget on uh so
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
obviously the first version of House
 
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 159 did not go very well um and you
 
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
know it was a draft I would say we had
 
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
some discussions we got good feedback
 
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
from uh testimony from all of you uh and
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
then the response was to do the February
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 159 which I
 
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
still think Falls a little bit short uh
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
but the goal once again was to come up
 
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
with something that could be more
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
consistent um I understand that the
 
00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 align:start position:0%
department of energy was concerned about
 
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
additional cost for Staffing um and I
 
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
think that that's a valid concern uh
 
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
seeing as we are entering into a
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
non-budget year it's difficult to come
 
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
up with a Staffing Solution when we
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
can't allocate funds for that
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I still think that enabling
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
and allowing our utilities to go out to
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
bid more than once every six months
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
should for our constituents provide more
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
price stability so that's some
 
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
background on 159 um and I would say
 
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe that this February
 
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
amendment is really the answer but I
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
think it's better than the initial bill
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and I do believe that representative
 
00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
Bernardi the chair of the sub commmittee
 
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
better any other com any other
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.270 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
just a clarification um this amendment
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be talking about um
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
it talks about only Electric utilities
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
so were we not concerned about um the
 
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
utilities the bill that I proposed is
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
focused on El electrical
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
rates not not Gas
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
Utilities so natural gas is a part of
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity in New Hampshire
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
because we're using natural gas to
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
produce electricity in many cases yeah
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
it is the driver of the cost that we see
 
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
okay Hydro nuclear Basel load so
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
anything that changes the electric rates
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is virtually entirely
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh derivative of natural gas prices okay
 
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.150 align:start position:0%
uh derivative of natural gas prices okay
thank

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
you so um hearing that discussion and
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
your you know your
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
um comments about the inadequacy or or
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
well the falling a little short of the
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
desired goal uh as you mentioned I had
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
proposed a bill for the next session uh
 
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
which you have as an lsar I I sent to
 
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.430 align:start position:0%
which you have as an lsar I I sent to
you

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
folks

00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
um which
 
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
um which
specifically

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh is focused on
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
um on lading of of
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
contracts um I did get some comments
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
because uh I spoke with the Department
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
of energy during the summer to find out
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
what their preliminary thoughts on that
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
were they sent me an email that
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
commented both on uh HB 159 but the
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
bottom of that email was comments on on
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
the concept of lattering uh it
 
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
referenced uh a puci ir and and a um
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
IV uh and I provided those for you
 
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
um the bottom line is the Department of
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
energy is not yet ready to sign on to
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
the concept of lading I mean one of the
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
the words they use are uh uh lading
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
options offer net positive results in
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
periods when Energy prices sharply
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
increase and opposite occurs in stable
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
or decreasing energy price Market uh the
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
next comment is latter contracts are
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
longer term I think that's where there
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
may be a disconnect between uh the bill
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
that I proposed and some that we've
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
spoken about and where the doe is is
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
going here because I I'm viewing laded
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
contracts and and the uh the bill that
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
that uh um OS has prepared thus far
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't say this but I'm viewing the
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
contract period be from three months to
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
nine or 12 months and I'm open for some
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
discussion on that but
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
um a a period that is less than the
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
current six Monon uh required uh
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
Contracting period which puts us into
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
this position of buying at what may be a
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
peak and then living with that for six
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
months so a three to n or 3 to 12 Monon
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
um contract period uh that with then
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
potentially allow the utilities to
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
survey the market survey what's
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
happening in the industry uh and
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
purchase uh electric power at
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
potentially a more more stable rate now
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
there was a report uh by the p on the
 
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
8th of May where they went over th this
 
00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.550 align:start position:0%
8th of May where they went over th this
uh

00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh circumstance they
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
reviewed uh eversource Unitil and uh
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
Liberties uh contracts and prices from
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
2018 through
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
2023 uh and
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrating uh the difficulty of the
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
six-month uh
 
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
required uh Contracting
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
to keep a stable or more stable uh
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
um all right hopefully that's good
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
okay um H and then at the back they get
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
comments from some of the community and
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
other uh Power producers uh and they
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:00.069 align:start position:0%
have uh
share

00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
share that with the rest of the
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh this is the uh Doe's report
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
um anyway at the back of the report see
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
pu's report uh they
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
discuss uh New Hampshire Electric
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
Cooperative um which uh is not regulated
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
by the Pu but did provide some
 
00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
comments and they indicated that its
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
service was proc appeared largely
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
through a blend of short medium and
 
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.670 align:start position:0%
through a blend of short medium and
long-term

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
contracts uh with which then allowed
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
them to not suffer as high a price spike
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
as the other three major
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
utilities uh saw when they were on the
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
six-month contract uh period it also
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
includes a comment from the Department
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
of energy that
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh that they did not yet support uh a a
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
lading concept
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh again that I believe their their
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
assessment is that these contracts would
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
all all be of a longer term
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
nature so I think there still is an
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity here for us to uh to move
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
forward with a a Ling uh uh proposal and
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
um I I'm uh moving forward with this LSR
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
and and I would be willing to accept
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
amendments from the doe or other folks
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
before this committee takes it up
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
formally in the uh in the next session
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh so if there are some uh interesting
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
ideas on that that are forthcoming uh
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
this committee would definitely be
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
willing to entertain
 
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
them uh furthermore the doe has a uh
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
investigation on this and and as
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
indicated in in their papers their
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
report on their position is going to be
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
coming out in
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
December uh so we should get better idea
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
of their thoughts in that
 
00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:24.590 align:start position:0%
of their thoughts in that
regard

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
regard
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
um so with those comments I I guess uh
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
I'm does anybody else on the committee
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
have anything they would like to add yes
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um just a comment on the
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's review of
 
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759 align:start position:0%
lettering I I would be interested to
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
hear from the Department as to where
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
they definition of lading is coming from
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
because we're certainly seeing shorter
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
term contracts in other states so I'd
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Tom France I'm
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
the director of regulatory at the
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
department of energy previous to this
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
position I held positions as Chief
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
Economist and director of electric at
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
Commission um as you mentioned we have a
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing investigation at the department
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
of energy that's uh sort of jumps off
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
from the pu's report we are deep into
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
that investigation at this point we have
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
a expert consulting firm we've met with
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
and discussed a number of these very
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
issues with the utilities and continue
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
to do so we will also be interviewing uh
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
our expectations will be interviewing
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
with thirdparty wholesale
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
suppliers uh number of other parties
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
we've even reached out and had a
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
productive interview just last week
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
concerning descending clock auctions
 
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
which some states use to procure default
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
service um I was at the Pu when we did
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
actually have laddering for some of our
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
utilities definitely makes rates
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
somewhat more stable
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
um is somewhat
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
attractive when rates are going up and
 
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759 align:start position:0%
much less so when rates are going down
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
one should always keep in mind that we
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
live in a world in New Hampshire where
 
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
there is uh
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
third-party retail supply and customers
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
can and have and will continue to do so
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
when it's in their best interest to
 
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:47.959 align:start position:0%
switch from the utility default service
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
to thirdparty
 
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
supply um and that actually occurred
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
when the rates were going up under a
 
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.710 align:start position:0%
when the rates were going up under a
lading

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
lading
 
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
situation uh I mean so so the lattering
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
was actually had rates tied in but as
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
the rates actually dropped in the
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
markets and the default Service uh
 
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079 align:start position:0%
contracts reflected older long-term
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
contracts folks moved to default service
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
I mean to uh third party supply that was
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
actually more reflective of the market
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
and lower so my my comments on this is
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity we have the
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
ability the Pu has the ability right now
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
to actually still have lading in there
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
um and certainly some states do
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
it it hides to some degree what the
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
actual costs are in the market depending
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
on how long those contracts uh are
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
extended with suppliers and at this
 
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
point I'd say let's wait and see what
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
December any initial Insight on the time
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
window of laddering that you're looking
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
at well most places have sort of a
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
shortterm midterm long-term long-term in
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
these markets is usually two to three
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
years most contracts and most suppliers
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to enter into uh contracts
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
for much longer than two or three years
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
and then they roll over so you're
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
rolling over some shortterm and then
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
every three years entering another
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
long-term term deal
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
markets can change as you know based on
 
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
world conditions rapidly and
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
significantly so what what's the
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
shortterm window that you those
 
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
short-term windows are still in the six-
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
month period still are not not less than
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
six months
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh they're you can maybe see three
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
months but suppliers in New England are
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
used to six-month
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
periods and there's a cost to going out
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
if you're going out every two or three
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
months for Supply there's a cost to the
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
to the wholesale suppliers to actually
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
put those bids together uh contract for
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
it so there's not a lot of contracts in
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
New England that are less than six
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
months but six months to 12 months is
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
very common uh sometimes you'll see a
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more than that and we'll
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
we'll be covering this in depth in in
 
00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.230 align:start position:0%
we'll be covering this in depth in in
our

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.350 align:start position:0%
our
report

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
members of the committee yes Mr Carman
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question so it was it's
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
interesting you're saying that when um
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
prices are rising because of lading um
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
well not because of lading well okay I
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
me so actually so let's say let's say
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
prices are actually decreasing so the uh
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
the the alternative suppliers the
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
non-default suppliers the prices are
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
decreasing so customers are leaving
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
default service mhm is there an impact
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
on the utilities are they have they
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
overbought at that point are they
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
someone stuck with extra energy actually
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question because the
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
risk is on the and it's meant to be is
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
third uh party supplier so so that's why
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
we moved to restructuring really and put
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
the generation Supply risk on third
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
party suppliers it's it's not on the
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
utility and we try to make sure that
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's not and the utility have the
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
utilities have very good representation
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're not because they're
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
not making any money on this this is a
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
pass through for them and so they go out
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
and they solicit they make sure that the
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
companies that they're are bidding on
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
this are uh financially capable and
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
managerially and administratively
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
capable to supply the the full
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
requirements of default service but the
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
risk if you think about a third party
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
supplier there's a risk for price they
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
can hedge some of that risk there's a
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
risk for quantity that one's actually a
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
little tougher to to to actually hedge
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
so they are obligated to
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
provide supply for all those customers
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
so if they're expecting let's say just
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
throughout a number
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
100 million megawatt
 
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.830 align:start position:0%
100 million megawatt
hours

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
but their prices are and end up being
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
higher than they should be or could be
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
compared to the market and other people
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
start undercutting those in the in the
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
retail supply Market in New
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that 100 uh that million
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours may actually end up being
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
too much that they actually expected to
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
supply and they'll be tied up with that
 
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:47.559 align:start position:0%
when people are leaving Because the
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
actual load will be less now they have
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
to do something with that so that's a
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
quantity risk and then of course if they
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
don't hedge well there's a price risk
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
and It ultimately those risks will be
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
prices so I I I guess I'm still a little
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
unclear so let's let's say that um
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
Liberty contracts for a total of 500
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
million megawatt hours for some period
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
but people are leaving default service
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
and actually the Liberty customers need
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
only half of that 250 million megawatt
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
hours is liberty and Liberty has a
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
contract for 500 million is Liberty then
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
on the hook for that remaining 250 where
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
who who's paying for that the supplier
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
is on the hook for that because it's
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
literally a all requirements contract so
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
if they expected 500,000 megawatt hours
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
somehow uh
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
provided through contract contracts with
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
with generators enough power to supply
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
that or from the market and so they now
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
have to do something with that
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
excess it's not on the utility it's not
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
on the customers it's on the wholesale
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
risks um can I ask you I'm very
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
interested to learn more about the
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
thirdparty suppliers and the
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
participation rate in terms of um
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
quantify the number of people who are
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
either businesses or residential who
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
choose to go with a third party supplier
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
rather than default service yeah we have
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of that I'm happy to send that to
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
you but in general it is sort of what
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
you'd expect the large cni customers
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
historically have moved to retail supply
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that's true in
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
other states too there sophisticated
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
saving an extra three four five Mills
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour potentially is a big
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
deal to them when they're purchasing
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
millions of kilowatt hours per month um
 
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
and so what we've seen pretty much
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
across the board is the large commercial
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
industrial customers in some cases over
 
00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
80 to 90% have actually moved a retail
 
00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:14.870 align:start position:0%
80 to 90% have actually moved a retail
supply

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
supply
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
um economically that makes sense the
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
value to them is much higher they have
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh more at
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
stake residential customers the cost of
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
searching the cost of energy the cost of
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
looking into
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
contracts is higher potentially for them
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
for what their savings might be might
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
only potentially be two three five6
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
dollar per month but that's seems like a
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
lot but there's a cost to that to
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
actually sign up beond the contract
 
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
monitor the contract know when the
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
contract ends uh what the prices are so
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
res residential
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
customers about somewhere around 15%
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
maybe 20 20% at most have actually moved
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
to competitive retail supply in New
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it depends a little bit by
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
the service territory it also depends a
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
little bit what time frame we're looking
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
at and
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh so and then if it
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
depends a little bit when they can leave
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
their leave their retail supplier some
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
leave and come back to default service
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
also if the default service price now is
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
lower uh and you have to be the retail
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:29.230 align:start position:0%
lower uh and you have to be the retail
supply

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
supply
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
you have to be somewhat careful what
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
happens at the end of the contract does
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
it move to a uh variable rate is it much
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
higher you know if it's like anything
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
you sign up for as a residential person
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh you have to you have to pay attention
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so as a followup um what I'm
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
hearing is that our residential
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
customers are not nearly as
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
sophisticated as our commercial
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
customers there's about a 15%
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
participation rate with the third party
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
suppliers although my understanding is
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
when we set up this system initially the
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
goal was that default service would not
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
really be the service that residential
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
customers were using but in effect
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
what's happened is it is what that
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of customers so what are we
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
at 85% of residential customers that
 
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:18.990 align:start position:0%
at 85% of residential customers that
aren't

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
doing third-party contracts are just
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
going with default because it's all they
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
know they're not sophisticated they
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
don't know how to sign up they don't
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
know how to research they don't know how
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
to get a better deal and there's some
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
fear I've heard from my constituents
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's some fear that there will be a
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
balloon payment or some additional cost
 
00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:40.039 align:start position:0%
or they'll be stuck with a variable rate
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
after the term ends so just like when
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
you're doing an introductory rate to a
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
credit card you have to be very careful
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
to get out of it before it goes to a
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
much higher rate it's the same thing
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
with electric so you're playing a bit of
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
a game there's a sophistication level
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
required or you end up getting burned
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
and certainly I would say in New
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire those 85% of the customers are
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
the folks who are residential customers
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about commercial here I
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
think they're the ones who are looking
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
to us to come up with a way to protect
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
them because they're going to continue
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
using the default service rate however
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
if you in your experience have some
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
ideas for how we could incentivize
 
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
better deals or more education on the
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
residential customer side so that we can
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
fix what was intended to be a system
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
that allowed people to not use default
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
service I'm very interested in
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions because I think we're stuck
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
now with 85% residential in default
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
favors we will be addressing that in our
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
report that that is really one of the
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
reasons we're doing the Deep dive in
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
there are no easy solutions here uh we
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
have I think a excellent cons uh
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
consumer group at the department of
 
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
energy and there's a fair amount of of
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
very good information on our website
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
about uh retail suppliers prices what's
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
out there uh but those are search costs
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm an economist and there's
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
definitely a search cost to looking at
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
that and understanding that and and
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
going through a contract and wondering
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
well how much am I really going to save
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
what period is it what happens at the
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
end of the contract we recognize that
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
that that's uh that's true in the energy
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
Market markets and as many other markets
 
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:30.919 align:start position:0%
as as you
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned yeah I I would just like to
 
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:37.519 align:start position:0%
add to to that I I think the uh the
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
constituents that I've spoken to by and
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
large have no clue that they can look
 
00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:48.039 align:start position:0%
for other sources of you electrical
 
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
supply and when they're told they can
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
I've had people come back to me and say
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
I still don't know how to do it it you
 
00:29:03.549 --> 00:29:03.559 align:start position:0%
know uh so the the process and how to do
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
it and and what the ramifications of it
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
are uh that has to be made much more
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
clear to folks people have said uh well
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
I put some solar panels on and now uh
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
will I lose the value of that if I
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
change my service it doesn't say
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
anything about that in the uh in all the
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
you information that I looked at so uh
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
it's it remains a huge problem it's one
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
of the biggest issues that that I run
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
into when I talk to constituents go to
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
public meetings what's going on with
 
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
electrical prices and how can we get
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
greater stability and and ideally
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
reduction in their cost um so to the
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
extent that you folks are working on a
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
December date I would highly advise as
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
my compatriot here has said you need to
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
focus in on on that issue uh as well as
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
you know what options are there to uh
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
bringing the costs closer to what the
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
basis when CH
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so it's been mentioned
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
that um during this six-month period um
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
without the lading that that utilities
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
could buy high but then the prices might
 
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:36.519 align:start position:0%
fall right and you're stuck with that
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
high price for six months my question is
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
what happens to that extra money is it
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
refunded to it clearly is not refunded
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
to the customers but is it just pure
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
profit for the utilities no the
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
utilities make no money on this so if
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
I'm a utility let's say eversource and I
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
enter into after I go out for
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
solicitation I issue a request for bids
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
get X number of bids come in I evaluate
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
the bids on a lowest cost basis for the
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
average price for the next six months
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
now the price will vary based on the
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
month months
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
like uh December and January are
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
obviously higher price months in in this
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
region than than something like
 
00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:30.039 align:start position:0%
September and October and that has to do
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
with the price of natural gas but that
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
contract then is uh signed if everything
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
goes well
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's the case is filed at the Public
 
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission the OCA Department
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
of energy copies of it it's a really
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
fast docket because that uncertainty
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
about getting the contract approved is
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
another risk to a re to a wholesale
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
supplier to and if approved then the
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
contracts executed and the prices become
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
effective a couple months later on the
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
first of the month in this case for most
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
for our utilities it's February 1 for
 
00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:16.039 align:start position:0%
six months um
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
and the price that let's say residential
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
customers pay is an average price for
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
each of those for all six months perhaps
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's well 20 cents to during the winter
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
period when a lot of winter months are
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
involved uh and right now ever sources
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
price is more like 11 and half to 12
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
cents so at the end of that six months
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
well let's get back to your question so
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
supplier hopes that they hedge their
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
fuel risk that they got the quantities
 
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
right that everything was bid correctly
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
and they cover all their costs and make
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit bit of money for
 
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.350 align:start position:0%
a little bit bit of money for
sure

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
followup so um you just described um the
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
procedure for um getting to this
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
contract you go out and you evaluate the
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
bids and everything I assume this has
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
been the same procedure for eons this is
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
what people do right just slightly less
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
than eons right right but I I think my
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
point is it's 2023 shouldn't things have
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
gotten a little easier a little faster
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
to especially with the internet to to
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
look at the information that's out there
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is why hasn't this
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
procedure evolved well I think it's
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
adjusted somewhat I mean uh it's adjust
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
based on the market conditions the
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
suppliers uh what the risks are but we
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
spend a fair amount of time looking at
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
other states and other places some
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
states do it a little bit differently
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
for example parts of Pennsylvania and
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
Ohio use a descending clock auction we
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that um because it may
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
actually get slightly better prices or
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
has some advantages but in general for
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
the states that have restructured now
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
again this is for states that have
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
restructured and and divested their
 
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
generating assets or their long-term
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
purchase power contracts others many
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
many states in in our country still are
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated and have uh
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
generation assets or long-term purchase
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
power contracts are both and so that's
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
basically a cost of service as we did it
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
forever up till n up till about 2000
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
2001 but for the last 20 years this is a
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
pretty standard way the the the time
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
frames have become a little bit quicker
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
the risks are tried to be reduced to the
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
suppliers to get a little bit better
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
pricing um but this is pretty standard
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
and I think we're always asking I know
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
the utility
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh purchases are also saying well how
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
can we do this better what can make it
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
more efficient what can reduce the risk
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit better so I think we always
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
ask that question and try to look at
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
it and that's one of the things we're
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
looking at uh with our consultant and
 
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
and hope to address in the report but
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty standard procedure for
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
Most states that actually are divested
 
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.790 align:start position:0%
Most states that actually are divested
thank

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.950 align:start position:0%
thank
you

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
again Mr France uh one thing we haven't
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
discussed is community power which is on
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
the rise I live in Lebanon and in fact
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
we have Community power there and we're
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
going to see Community power in more and
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
more communities uh I'm wondering if you
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
can speak about the effects that uh
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
customers moving onto Community power
 
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
will have on default service and in
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
particular I wonder about uh this isn't
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
really about the the uh contracts but I
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
think about the auctions where if the
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
demand for default service
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
decreases it seems like the clearing
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
prices also ought to decrease so I'm
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can speak to community
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
power yeah I'm not going to spend a lot
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
of time on that at this point but I will
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
say this about Community power it offers
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh opportunities for savings for
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
potential potentially for savings for
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
communities um it is
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
and I have talked to many
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
suppliers uh and we hear this and we
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
hear it from our utility purchasers with
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
with the wholesale suppliers it is a
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
risk that they are aware of and to some
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
degree still coming to grips with how it
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
affects their bids for default service
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
some of it's
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
just timing some of it's understanding
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh when folks go to community power so
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
that the wholesale suppliers can
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
actually hedge that understand if that
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
load leaves how large that load is but
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
if you're expecting potentially to sell
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
a million megawatt hours and you have a
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
number of communities large ones leaving
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
during a certain period uh if they know
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
that they can maybe hedge that pretty
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
pretty well but they have concerns about
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
it and it is definitely an area we will
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
report then that's all I'd really like
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
now but everybody well having said that
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'll say one more thing everybody's in
 
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
plays in the same same Market you know
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
whether you're Community power uh group
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
purchasing in the market or or your a
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
utility uh negotiating contract with a
 
00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:02.349 align:start position:0%
utility uh negotiating contract with a
wholesale

00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
wholesale
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
supplier uh there one big Market in New
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
England all those folks are buying power
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
for default service or to retail supply
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
or for Community power and that's the
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
same basic generation across New England
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
players more comment if you could in
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
indulge me Mr fron um I'm just reviewing
 
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
this report on New Hampshire energy
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
commodity procurement I don't know if
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with this or not I'm
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
just looking at it for the first time P
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
um it's from the Pu and it looks like it
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
was published May 8 this year PU Report
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
okay so on page eight um there's a
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
comment from
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
Unitil uh where apparently they they had
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
an issue in Massachusetts where one of
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
their subsidiaries went out to do a an
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
RFP solicitation and it failed MH and so
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
Unitil made the comment that um the New
 
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire puc should authorize Electric
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
utilities to self-supply Via direct
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
purchases from the iso New England
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
Market in the event of a failed
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
solicitation without further
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
administrative or regulatory process
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
beyond what is currently undertaken for
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
approval of default Service rates with
 
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
the standardized approach to retail
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
ratemaking what are your thoughts on
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
that because I think that that's kind of
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
well honestly there aren't many choices
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
if there's a failed auction
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and and we've had certain
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
tranches of power for certain customer
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
classes over certain periods even in New
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fail recently and that was a
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
self-supply issue ultimately the policy
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
right now is that you quickly turn it
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
around go back out hope that uh someone
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
realized they maybe should have actually
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
bid on
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
that power and and maybe we'll submit a
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
bid but if they
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
don't uh the time frames are tight uh
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
and ultimately I think we end up with a
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
self-supply issue self-supply is
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
interesting because it'll truly reflect
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
the market price but it also puts
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous risk on customers because
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
instead of knowing what that price is
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
now you're at the whims of a market that
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
can vary dramatically hourly daily
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
monthly and that'll that price will
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately get Tred up over time
 
00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:41.710 align:start position:0%
ultimately get Tred up over time
so

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking at it in the report
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's one of the aspects that we we're
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
diving into
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and we'll be addressing it there I'm
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
not sure I want
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
to go a whole lot further than that at
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
this point thank you I appreciate you
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
looking into it in the report it seems
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
like it would be way better for our
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
constituents than the volatility of the
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
the ongoing rate changes well remember
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
that self-supply is perhaps the most
 
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
volle of all supp all pricing again
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
depending it could be though that you
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
set the price and customers then adjust
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
to the real type real prices in the
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
market and for whatever reason the
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
actual price goes down and customers
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
will may maybe actually save on on
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
self-supply uh it's a complicated issue
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
but there's definitely risks ass
 
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
associated with self-supply
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
too thank you very much my
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
pleasure thank you Mr France uh we look
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
report uh Mr Lata or any of the other uh
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
utilities have any comments they would
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:03.230 align:start position:0%
like to
make

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Michael Lata representing
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
eversource um really great discussion
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
this morning and I think the uh
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is really focusing in on a
 
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
number of the the key issues um that you
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
want to consider when looking at at
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
default service and um I just put a fine
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
point on a couple of them uh that were
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned one is
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
um as the legislature looks at default
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
service I think defining what the role
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
as we sit here in in
 
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
2023 of default service is um so RSA
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
374f uh colon 3 sort of provides the
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
framework that the utilities and the
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
commission and now doe Implement default
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
service which is kind of the the basic
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
parameters and it's it's actually very
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
high level level um just that default
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
service should be a safety net for
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
customers uh assure universal access and
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
be procured through um the competitive
 
00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
market and
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
so the discussion uh started off that
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps we want default service
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
to be a more stable product um and and
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's certainly you know the purview of
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
the legislature to direct the utilities
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
and the the commission to develop a
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
framework around a a more stable product
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
lading is one way to to reduce
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
volatility and Achieve that end um
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
previously you know I I think the
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
commission uh had looked at it as more
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
of a a market-based uh approach um so
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
you want the prices to be as reflective
 
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
of the wholesale Market um so customers
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
experience the the changes in the market
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
so those are just two different um
 
00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
different obviously approaches and
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh given the the volatility that we've
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
seen um you know certainly makes sense
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
that the commission and might excuse me
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature might want to revisit
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
and Tom talked a lot about the report
 
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
and I know they're looking at a number
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
of of these issues as well um another
 
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
consideration is um how detailed uh you
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
would want legislation to be um you know
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
one approach is you you sort of set a
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
goal you know price stability reduce
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
volatility or you know more reflective
 
00:44:35.549 --> 00:44:35.559 align:start position:0%
of of markets and then you direct uh the
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
commission to develop a
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
framework um to achieve that goal
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
another approach is you sort of put that
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
framework into statute which um you know
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
you'll probably get closer to what you
 
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
want if it's in uh in statute but if you
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
need to make changes and adjust that
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
then obviously you have to go back and
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
change the law uh as opposed to some
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
some additional flexibility that the uh
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
regul regulator may have if you're just
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
setting a policy goal um and the the
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
final piece or actually there's one
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
other item I just want to touch on uh
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
but uh you know as Tom described this is
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
a pass through um this is basically
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
we're procuring this service on behalf
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
of our customers what we pay in the
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
market every six months is um what the
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
customers pay we do not profit um and
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
you know one of the areas as you're
 
00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
looking at this um that the utilities
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
would have a concern or I should really
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
just say eversource but I I think the
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
other utilities would share it is is the
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
amount of risk the utility is taking on
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
so the more flexibility and sort of
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
utility judgment you put into the
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
process the more risk you're potentially
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
putting on the utility so if you said
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
hey utility go out you know and by three
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
months six months one year you decide
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
your port folio and and get the best
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
deal for customers you know one of the
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that utility would have is
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
these are very volatile markets and what
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
if we're wrong right what if we think
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing the right thing at the
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
period of time and we use our best
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
judgment but it turns out that prices
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
went down uh and then there's concern
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
that you know someone could look back
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
and say oh you know your your choices
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
resulted in um customers paying higher
 
00:46:25.319 --> 00:46:26.349 align:start position:0%
resulted in um customers paying higher
costs

00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
and should there be a disallowance and
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's not a position we want to be in
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
that's not a risk that we want to take
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
as part of this process so um having a
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
clearly defined process you know one of
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the current process is
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
every six months you shall do X and you
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
know we move on uh but having a clearly
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
defined process that doesn't put
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
additional risk on the utility again as
 
00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
a pass through product uh is is
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
important um um and the final thing I
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
just want to say is is just touching on
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
um representative MC Williams last
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
question of uh of Tom um in terms of
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
self-supply this was a a serious concern
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
that eversource um had going into uh
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
last winter that we would have um really
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
a failed solicitation so no one would we
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
put out our our load following RFP and
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
no one would bid in um or the bids that
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
we would get would be so outside of what
 
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
we would expect them to be that it would
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
our view be a failed auction and so um
 
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
just to put sort of a fine point on what
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
self Supply is or what we were
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
considering at the time and what other
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities in fact we did have a failed
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh RFP for our large customer group but
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
as Tom mentioned they're largely already
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
being served by competitive suppliers um
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
we would simply go to to the iso Market
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
and procure uh the day ahead price so if
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
you look at your your ISO app there's a
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
real time and a day ahead so you know
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
again we wouldn't be sort of using
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
judgment uh there we we don't have power
 
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
plants to supply with uh we would just
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
take the the day ahead pricing and
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's what our our customers would pay
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
and um as as noted that would be you
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
know that's probably the most volatile
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
of all the options so uh just want to
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
put a a a fine point on that and then um
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
and to representative uh uh Wendy
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
Thomas's question about you know hey why
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
don't you do this differently um a
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
couple of things I point out eversource
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
actually divested of our uh generation
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
assets um and started this current
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
process I think it was
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
2018 uh so we've been doing this
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
six-month RFP not for a terribly long
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
time um and uh we do look as as Tom said
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
at ways to improve this and um just to
 
00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:00.799 align:start position:0%
give an example one of the things we did
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
last year because of this concern about
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
failed auctions was uh while at the
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
six-month period we're going out for our
 
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
full customer load we actually broke
 
00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:13.799 align:start position:0%
that up into to smaller tranches so
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
suppliers didn't have to bid on
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
everything so we're going out for
 
00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:20.839 align:start position:0%
everything but they could bid in on on
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
smaller pieces and we we did find that
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
that attracted or we believe that
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
attracted larger number of suppliers so
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh so we do look to to improve the
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
process within the existing framework uh
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
as we go uh but certainly you know there
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
there is risk of uh of failure due to
 
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:45.470 align:start position:0%
there is risk of uh of failure due to
the

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
volatility thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr L always good to see
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
you I'm I'm thinking about uh what you
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
said about the utilities being um let's
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
say locked into uh situations where it's
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
not optimal you know they get locked
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
into something and I'm thinking about s
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
sp54 which allows for up to 20y year
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
contracts for up to 20% of the load and
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how eversource views that
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
do you think eversource will be availing
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
themselves of such contracts and and
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
what about the risk profile there sure
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that the
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
legislature did um to address that risk
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
issue in Senate Bill 54 was um the
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
utility essentially is acting as a for
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
lack of a better word of putting it
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
almost like a financing agent for uh the
 
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
generation asset so we put out a a
 
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
competitive RFP um you know different
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
generators would would bid into that
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
based on the criteria we would make a
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
selection and then um under Senate Bill
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
54 we would purchase that power at a
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
fixed price and resell it into the
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
marketplace uh and if there are uh the
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
idea would be that that power is less
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
expensive than the market and um
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
customers would receive the benefit of
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
that however if the cost of the fixed
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
price contract uh exceeded the market
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
price then that would be uh essentially
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
collected from customers as a a truing
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
up over a period of time so uh so there
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
was sort of a mechanism built into uh
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
that statute to to address that risk so
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
that the utility would be sort of
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable to proceed in that process
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
risk

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
so you started off saying one of your
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
concerns with potential lading was
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh you might be subject to the risk of
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
having made bad judgments in choice of
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
contracts uh and uh locked yourself into
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
some uh contracts where the price was
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm I have a little
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
difficulty understanding that because
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
right now you you are doing contracts at
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
six Monon intervals and you if when you
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
do that you know if the market price
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.789 align:start position:0%
do that you know if the market price
drops

00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
drops
 
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
two months in and stays low for the last
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
last four months uh customers are are
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
paying that elevated price you aren't
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
paying any uh anything for as a penalty
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
so how how would it be different if we
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
just said you could have contracts that
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
range from three to 15 months sure it um
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's a fair question it depends on on
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
the structure of the lading so if you
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
were to um say utility go out you
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
know twice a year for 50% of your load
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
for one-year contract so you're breaking
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
up the load so it's not 100% every six
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
months but it's 50% every every six
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
months but their year-long contract so
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
you're staggering it great like we know
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
what to do and we would Implement that
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's actually similar to what we do
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
in in other states but if you were to
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
say uh utility you may procure three
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
months six months one year use your best
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
judgment and you know make your filings
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
for approval at the commission so give
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
us lots of of um
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
flexibility that would be I think a
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
concern for for the utility to have sort
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
of too much judgment in it um so the
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
concept of lading itself we very
 
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable with um and have experience
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
with it's just how prescriptive is it um
 
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
you know you could say you know three
 
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
months uh excuse me three procurements
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
per year at
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
varying um uh intervals uh but as long
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
as that's clear and we're implementing
 
00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:19.799 align:start position:0%
that either regulation or statute we
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
don't have an issue with that it would
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
be if you said hey you know use your
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
best judgment to get the best
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
deal that in you know would uh uh
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
increase the risk for the utility to to
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
sort of you
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
know be making that judgment um uh
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
within a framework versus executing a
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
framework if that makes sense so so you
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
would be at risk of the slings and
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
arrows of public perception for having
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
made bad uh decisions but I I the cost
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
still should be the same irrespective of
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know to the customer or to you
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
because it's all passed through you just
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
made some bad judgments that your
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
customers are going to be impacted by
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
sure we we don't want to be in the
 
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.030 align:start position:0%
sure we we don't want to be in the
position

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
where we may make bad judgments I I
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
guess uh we quite frankly don't have um
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
those staff members anymore uh you know
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
back when we own generation we were
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
managing our portfolio dispatching
 
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
generation making market market purchase
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
is when we uh divested of generation we
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know those people either do other
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
things or have retired or or left the
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
company and so um you know I guess what
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
I'm uh saying is you know we we want a
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
clear framework that we're executing as
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
opposed to to
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
managing thank
 
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
Corman um so we heard earlier that it it
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
sounds like it is possible to Lad
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
already that it's not prohibited uh is
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
there a reason that eversource has not
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
laded so far in New Hampshire and if we
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
actually had legislation that actually
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
exp explicitly says you may lad would
 
00:56:13.359 --> 00:56:14.670 align:start position:0%
exp explicitly says you may lad would
that

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
somehow enable you to Lad more than you
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
are able to
 
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.069 align:start position:0%
are able to
now

00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so the reason that eversource does
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
not uh uh ladder in New Hampshire is
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
because of commission order following uh
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
electric restructuring and the sale of
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
Our Generation assets the company
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
actually uh we had to propose how we
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
would procure energy on behalf of our
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
customers and the company's proposal um
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
at the time I think this was in the 2017
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
time frame was actually to to do lading
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and the commission um directed us as
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
part of a settlement we we agreed to it
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
um to do the current six-month month
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
block so um so if the legislature were
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
to um direct either the utility or
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
obviously the commission to approve
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
lading we would certainly Implement that
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
and I I suppose it would provide a level
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
of of clarity on what the legislature
 
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
wants from a procurement standpoint but
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
um we did propose that uh uh and as as
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
um Mr France had mentioned other
 
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
utilities uh had previously employed
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
strategy so to follow up on that what
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing is this it sounds like from
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
ever source's perspective you would like
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
more Direction you want sort of an
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
engineered setup structure where the
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
legislation says there's a certain
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
number of procurements per year at a
 
00:57:58.270 --> 00:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
certain interval for a certain period of
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
time and you want to be told that's what
 
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to do rather than what my
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
colleague had suggested which was
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that says the
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
utilities may do between three and say
 
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
18mth period bids because you want more
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
Direction you don't want it to be loose
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
you don't want an artistic solution you
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
want an engineered solution is that what
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing about eversource's approach
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
here sure if the
 
00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.349 align:start position:0%
here sure if the
legislature

00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:58:32.589 --> 00:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
um wants to change uh how the utilities
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
procur default service
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
um we would want clear Direction either
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
through statute or direction from the
 
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
regulator so an approach as I said you
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
know you could say in the legislation it
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
says you will do X or
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
alternatively um you could could direct
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission to
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
develop that framework based upon your
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
public policy objectives or you could
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
direct the utilities to um uh propose a
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
framework for approval by the Pu but we
 
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
want a clear consistent framework um
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
whether that comes from the legislature
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
directly or comes from uh the commission
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
and you know there's probably a bit more
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
uh flexibility in the regulatory
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
approach uh because you don't have to
 
00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839 align:start position:0%
change the law every time you want to
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
change this process but but we would
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
want sort of clear Direction coming out
 
00:59:37.839 --> 00:59:38.910 align:start position:0%
want sort of clear Direction coming out
of

00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
whatever uh body is is making the the
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
changes thank
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
you oh thank you chair thank you Mr Lata
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
um many of my concerns are just answered
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
so just a refresh FR right now the
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
utilities would have to with this
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed the utilities be
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
working with the PCU Department of
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
energy and the commiss the commission
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
now to come up with a way would that not
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
clarify for the utilities what to
 
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
do with Through The Regulators with this
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
amendment are you
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
thinking we should look into different
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
wording thank you I I I'm not sure which
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
amendment you're referring to I I did
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
have representative MC Williams
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment from February if it's a
 
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
different amendment I I have not seen
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
that so I I I think what he's referring
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
to is is there is a LSR that is
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
proposing lading it has not been fully
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
drafted by the uh uh OS uh and but
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
that's the concept that that we have
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
been talking about as as derivative of
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
HB 159 discussion here got I I've seen
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
the LSR title outside of that I guess I
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the you know I thank it
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
my apologies to that I was refering to
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
LSR I think that is going to be
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
addressed um do look it up and get back
 
01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.470 align:start position:0%
addressed um do look it up and get back
to

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
us we'd be happy to to weigh in on on
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman yeah one other
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
question I'm just thinking uh right now
 
01:01:34.829 --> 01:01:34.839 align:start position:0%
you're in this mode where every six
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
months you go out for a contract and
 
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that with lading it's
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
every three months or every two months
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
so you're going out for contracts more
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
frequently does that add an
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
administrative cost that that is
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
increased because of that increased
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
frequency of going after contracts is
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
that an added administrative cost and
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
then does that if so does that get
 
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
passed through to
 
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
customers the answer to both questions
 
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
is yes the the the more uh rfps we we uh
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
put out into the market and then review
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
the results uh that is added cost and
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
then the filings associated with those
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
for approval at the commission and I
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
think uh Mr France had mentioned also
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
the uh cost of the suppliers to respond
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
to those ultimately that is pass through
 
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair um first of all I
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
I want you to know that I give respect
 
01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:39.580 align:start position:0%
to anyone who uses the phrase slings and
 
01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.230 align:start position:0%
to anyone who uses the phrase slings and
[Music]

01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
arrows um my my my question is that um
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
you're clearly asking for an for what uh
 
01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:50.839 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams said an
 
01:02:50.839 --> 01:02:52.510 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams said an
engineered

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
engineered
 
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
solution um and so you're asking the
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
legislature to to essentially tell you
 
01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
guys what to do um my concern is what if
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
we don't get it right what if we don't
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
include something and so what I'm saying
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
I guess is
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
that I I mean I agree with this this LSR
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I do have some questions on it um but
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
isn't that your job to sort of tell us
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
the procedures so that we can then
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
incorporate it instead of us telling you
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
what to do sure and I apologize if if
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't uh sort of
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
clear if the legislature wants to change
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
how default service is is procured there
 
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
there's two ways to go about doing that
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
um one is to put the process that you
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
want into statute and we would be H if
 
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
that is the direction you decide to go
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
in um we would be happy to work with the
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and offer suggestions based
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
upon our experience in other states um
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
the concern representative Thomas that
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
you're raising a what if we get that
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
wrong despite everybody's best
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
intentions um the other way to go about
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
doing it is to put public policy
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
objectives into statute and say we want
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
default service to reflect you know
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
reduced volatility on behalf of
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
customers and be procured you know
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
through a competitive process so and you
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
direct the
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
regulator um to approve that type or
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
develop uh that type of of solicitation
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
so that way you're saying these are the
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
goals that the legislature wants and
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
Commission Implement that and obviously
 
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
the utilities would would implement M
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
through our filing so
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
um what I'm the concern that I'm just
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
raising um is if you were to say you
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
know sort of open the doors for the
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
utility and say hey utility go out and
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
get the best deal for for the customer
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
you can do three months you can do six
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
months you can do it whenever you want
 
01:05:17.279 --> 01:05:18.789 align:start position:0%
months you can do it whenever you want
your

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
monitoring that increases risk because
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
um there a lot of judgment there's a lot
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
of volatility and uh that would open the
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
door for for sort of second guessing and
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the threat of disallowance if if we
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
were incorrect
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um so if we put this
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
into public policy
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
objectives um how would you recommend
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
that those objectives be measured
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
because you cannot have objectives that
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
measurable so you would uh
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh if you were to change the RSA to say
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of default service is
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
to provide a a safety net and shall um
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
be procured in a manner to reduce price
 
01:06:12.319 --> 01:06:14.190 align:start position:0%
be procured in a manner to reduce price
volatility

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
volatility
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
um then it would be on the utilities and
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
commission well really the commission to
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
approve um
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh filings that reflected that and so
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
lading would be one instrument that you
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
could use um to reduce volatility uh and
 
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:40.839 align:start position:0%
so uh you know there's a lot of review
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
that goes into these these filings um
 
01:06:47.789 --> 01:06:47.799 align:start position:0%
and you know there are periodic uh
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
investigations uh there were two that Mr
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
France had mentioned one by the
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
commission one by by the doe and so so
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
you know as you gain
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
experience you know you can go back and
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
look and say did this work out how we
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
intended it and one of the benefits of
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh if you were pursuing more of a
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
regulatory solution versus having a
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
structure in statute is the regulator
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
could make make changes to that um you
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
know if they found that It produced bad
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes they could could make uh you
 
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
know direct the utilities to make
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
filing thank you very
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
much I'm going to ask since this is a
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
working session there's nothing formal
 
01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
here is there anybody else in the
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
audience that is interested in making
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
comments on the the concepts that we've
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
here all right hearing none um what this
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
Comm committee needs to do is first well
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
it needs to do I guess two things we've
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
talked about here at the same time one
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
is address what are we going to do with
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
the current HB
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
159 as a as the Amendments been proposed
 
01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
um any any further Insight or
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the LSR that is in
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
preparation still so uh I'm going to
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
first start we have a motion on the
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
table seconded that we uh adopt the uh
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh amendment to HB
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
159 I think our initial discussion was
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
none of us thought it was ready for
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
prime time but we need to vote on that
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
and and then move to the next step so uh
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
I don't have a clerk so I'm going to
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
just call the rooll myself Wendy Thomas
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
um well
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
I um I guess I'm going to vote no on on
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
that Amendment based on on the
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
had Williams um I have a further
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I'm gonna vote no on this
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
one for a different Amendment all right
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
so no and and the chair votes no so the
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
amendment as uh February Amendment the
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
February Amendment uh
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
fails oh is he subbing for some
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
yeah you're
 
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
advising okay so you have a further
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
amendment I do um so my proposal is we
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
take your your draft LSR and we put it
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
in as an amendment to 159 to continue
 
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.630 align:start position:0%
in as an amendment to 159 to continue
the

01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
conversation um and obviously we could
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
have a floor amendment to it based on
 
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
the December study but to keep this
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
moving forward um I think I'd like to
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
try to keep it alive and put your we'll
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
call it the Bernardi
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to to
 
01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
159 so I mean the LSR is going to go
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
forward anyway do we need to continue HB
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
159 or can we just rely on a new bill
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
number um I think it's a timing question
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
yeah right because if we can get good
 
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
input in the December review from the
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy I think it would
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
really become a floor Amendment with
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the feedback we received for
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
the January vote but this just keeps it
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
alive so we keep talking about it and it
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
is likely not going to move forward much
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
past January but it's an ongoing
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
discussion we have a vehicle to keep
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
discussing until the LSR comes up for
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
hearing in January February right it's
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
proposal all right um so I moved to
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
adopt the uh Bernardi LSR as an
 
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
motion yes there is but I have some
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
questions on it yes but yes this the
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
motion is to second that
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
right discussion
 
01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.270 align:start position:0%
right discussion
then

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
um it's it's sort of a a definition uh
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
on line 16 and and I want to make it
 
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
known I'm a writer I'm not an editor but
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
I do think that somebody went crazy with
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
the commas um on this line but it says
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
that the commission may Implement
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
measures to discourage misuse or
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
long-term use of default service can you
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
just Define
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
that is in the current statute the
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
my Amendment going to uh so wait a
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
minute here get the right you're you're
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh HP
 
01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:17.830 align:start position:0%
uh HP
159

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
159
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes6 yes so that's that's that's in the
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
current statute uh uh that has not been
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
changed by my Amendment or the February
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to HB
 
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.950 align:start position:0%
amendment to HB
159

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
159
 
01:12:36.629 --> 01:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
um I I can only speculate as we all can
 
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
as to what that means but it's not
 
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
Define you're
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
right so just a those commas are
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
you all right any further
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
comment um just to follow up on intent
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
here um I'd like to keep House Bill 159
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
alive because I'd like it to be a
 
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle to receive information from the
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
report from the Department of energy in
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
December um and potentially have some
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
more discussion on this in January as a
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
full house which I don't have high hopes
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
for this actually passing but I see this
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
as sort of doing our homework and
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
getting our ducks in a row for the real
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
bill this LSR will become for hearings
 
01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.750 align:start position:0%
bill this LSR will become for hearings
next

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
as a replacement for HB
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
159 um in order to keep
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%

adjourn this working session of the
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
Science Tech and energy thank you very
 
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
much for your participation and we do
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%

yeah

03:04:10.030 --> 03:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:12.590 --> 03:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
welcome everyone um I see we're past
 
03:04:17.229 --> 03:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
1:00 so time we would get going um this
 
03:04:22.429 --> 03:04:22.439 align:start position:0%
is a uh work session uh of the St
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee for uh HB
 
03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
558 um to my uh well the four voting
 
03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee are myself
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas
 
03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative Tom PL and representative
 
03:04:44.550 --> 03:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
of C
 
03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
McGee um uh we have four assigned to the
 
03:04:52.190 --> 03:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee it is my intent to go over
 
03:04:54.469 --> 03:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
I understand there is a Amendment that's
 
03:04:57.550 --> 03:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
been presented by representative Ammon
 
03:05:00.110 --> 03:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's my intent to to uh bring him up
 
03:05:02.510 --> 03:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
and discuss the amendment and then we
 
03:05:06.229 --> 03:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
can discuss the pros and cons anybody
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
else that would like to come up and
 
03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
speak on that Amendment or make other
 
03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
alternative alternative um position May
 
03:05:19.229 --> 03:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
and it is my intent that um we aren't
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
here that long but we'll be here as long
 
03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
as it takes for people to discuss
 
03:05:27.429 --> 03:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
matters and then we'll vote on the um on
 
03:05:30.429 --> 03:05:30.439 align:start position:0%
our uh you recommended action uh in the
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
event that we get bogged down I have a
 
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
reserve today in case we have to meet
 
03:05:37.389 --> 03:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
again but I don't believe we uh we will
 
03:05:40.630 --> 03:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
need that I I I hope we don't so with
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
that in mind uh representative Ammon
 
03:05:52.590 --> 03:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
down all right thank you for the record
 
03:05:56.349 --> 03:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
my name is Keith Ammon I represent
 
03:05:58.950 --> 03:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
42 um so we had the hearing the public
 
03:06:03.550 --> 03:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on the original version of the
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
bill back in February I
 
03:06:09.710 --> 03:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
believe and we had uh a lot of
 
03:06:12.429 --> 03:06:12.439 align:start position:0%
testimony uh in support of the bill but
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
saying that it needed work and so over
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
the summer and in the most recent I'd
 
03:06:20.830 --> 03:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
say six weeks is when it got more
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
intense I reached out to the different
 
03:06:26.349 --> 03:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
parties that had testified uh including
 
03:06:29.710 --> 03:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
the department of energy uh eversource
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
and clean energy New Hampshire those are
 
03:06:34.990 --> 03:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
the three main stakeholders that that
 
03:06:37.309 --> 03:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
gave input and I went through their
 
03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and kind of compiled all the
 
03:06:43.469 --> 03:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
concerns and began asking uh for a
 
03:06:45.469 --> 03:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
solution uh to making the bill something
 
03:06:48.229 --> 03:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
that could be passed and so we we
 
03:06:48.239 --> 03:06:49.910 align:start position:0%
that could be passed and so we we
settled

03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
settled
 
03:06:53.790 --> 03:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
on um this directive for the Department
 
03:06:57.389 --> 03:06:57.399 align:start position:0%
of energy to conduct a technical study
 
03:06:59.429 --> 03:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
of the issues surrounding micro
 
03:07:03.389 --> 03:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
GDs um and if you look at the effective
 
03:07:06.030 --> 03:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
date it's it's effective 60 days after
 
03:07:09.070 --> 03:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
passage so that would be sometime maybe
 
03:07:11.150 --> 03:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
April or May next year you know if it
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
goes through um and then 120 days from
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
that date or sorry 60 days from that
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
date begins this 120-day clock for the
 
03:07:23.229 --> 03:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to prepare for the
 
03:07:27.150 --> 03:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
study and then from that date so that
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
would put us
 
03:07:31.990 --> 03:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
in July maybe November next year would
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
be the beginning of that year-long study
 
03:07:37.389 --> 03:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
process and then they would be uh
 
03:07:40.030 --> 03:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
requested to issue a final report that
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
covers the um the items listed in
 
03:07:46.349 --> 03:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
section two and that section Roman
 
03:07:48.870 --> 03:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 uh is pretty much a
 
03:07:50.229 --> 03:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
compilation of the things that were
 
03:07:52.670 --> 03:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
discussed in February during the public
 
03:07:54.710 --> 03:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
hearing uh including one that I hadn't
 
03:07:57.070 --> 03:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
thought of cyber security and phys
 
03:07:59.229 --> 03:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
physical security and I think that was
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
an important one that didn't make it
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
into the original version of the
 
03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
bill so and I think there's others here
 
03:08:09.870 --> 03:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
in support if you would would uh have a
 
03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
reason to call them up Mr
 
03:08:12.040 --> 03:08:14.630 align:start position:0%
reason to call them up Mr
chairman

03:08:14.630 --> 03:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions from
 
03:08:17.560 --> 03:08:19.269 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions from
our

03:08:19.269 --> 03:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:08:21.510 --> 03:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative
 
03:08:24.550 --> 03:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
mcge thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
03:08:27.910 --> 03:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative um
 
03:08:29.870 --> 03:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
I took a look at this and I think it you
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
know what it has included in it looks
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
fine to me um I'm wondering if uh you
 
03:08:38.190 --> 03:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
could speak a little bit about the
 
03:08:41.870 --> 03:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
objective um are we looking to just get
 
03:08:44.190 --> 03:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
over a year from now on micro grids um
 
03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
so that we have more information or are
 
03:08:55.309 --> 03:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
we looking to um bring about a pilot in
 
03:08:57.150 --> 03:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
in other words I'm just trying to figure
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
out yeah what the objective is yeah
 
03:09:00.429 --> 03:09:00.439 align:start position:0%
because because it's going to take us a
 
03:09:02.030 --> 03:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
long time into the future and we did
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a micro grid study and an attempt
 
03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
over UNH um which you probably know all
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
about right um that just sort of got
 
03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
stalled and and didn't get implemented
 
03:09:14.389 --> 03:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering how this is
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
intended to help sure if you look at the
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
very last line on the first page 32 it
 
03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
says the report shall provide
 
03:09:27.429 --> 03:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
guidance um to to the legislature and
 
03:09:29.070 --> 03:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission on
 
03:09:32.269 --> 03:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
developing a microgrid pilot program
 
03:09:36.389 --> 03:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
that balances several different issues
 
03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
um so eversource has had a recent
 
03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
experience in Massachusetts with a a
 
03:09:43.990 --> 03:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
micro grid
 
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
installation where they would have had
 
03:09:48.790 --> 03:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
to install very expensive transmission
 
03:09:51.429 --> 03:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
lines to solve an issue in a certain
 
03:09:53.309 --> 03:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
community and instead they created a
 
03:09:55.309 --> 03:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
micro grid that had some battery storage
 
03:09:59.309 --> 03:09:59.319 align:start position:0%
that was able to uh negate the need for
 
03:10:01.990 --> 03:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
that expensive transmission so um I
 
03:10:03.469 --> 03:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
think ever Source has had a positive
 
03:10:06.389 --> 03:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
experience in other states around this
 
03:10:10.830 --> 03:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
concept of a micro grid um and I think
 
03:10:13.389 --> 03:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire sort of needs to catch up
 
03:10:14.830 --> 03:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you a little background on
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
the the impetus of this
 
03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill um the governor signed an executive
 
03:10:21.990 --> 03:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
order in 201 early
 
03:10:25.269 --> 03:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
2022 created a a cryptocurrency and
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
digital asset commission okay and so we
 
03:10:30.910 --> 03:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
had a year-long um commission it was
 
03:10:33.229 --> 03:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
held at the Department of Business and
 
03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs and we had various
 
03:10:38.110 --> 03:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
experts come in and talk to um talk to
 
03:10:40.510 --> 03:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
us about these issues and one of the
 
03:10:42.030 --> 03:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
issu one of the the subjects that came
 
03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
up was the subject of energy use so we
 
03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
had all these energy experts come in and
 
03:10:49.469 --> 03:10:49.479 align:start position:0%
talk to us about the energy use and it
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
turns out that there are scenarios where
 
03:10:58.110 --> 03:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
um this this uh ability to vary the
 
03:11:01.070 --> 03:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
load uh within a few minutes right so
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
you can ramp up and ramp down a mining
 
03:11:08.269 --> 03:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh rig it's actually having positive uh
 
03:11:10.990 --> 03:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
effects on encouraging overbuilding
 
03:11:13.630 --> 03:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
capacity because it makes it makes a
 
03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
project economically viable to be able
 
03:11:18.229 --> 03:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
to utilize electricity that otherwise
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go to the grid you see what I'm
 
03:11:23.309 --> 03:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
saying so that's that's the concept of a
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
large flexible load it could be hydrogen
 
03:11:27.750 --> 03:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
production it could be a data center
 
03:11:30.229 --> 03:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
like a data center that supports AI for
 
03:11:31.670 --> 03:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
instance right there's there's these
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
ideas of large flexible loads that fit
 
03:11:37.150 --> 03:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
kind of into this micro grid concept
 
03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
where that extra piece could make the
 
03:11:42.229 --> 03:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
whole project more economically viable
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
so that was the impetus of it we wanted
 
03:11:46.190 --> 03:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
to make something technology
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
neutral um and that was the original
 
03:11:51.229 --> 03:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
version of the bill was technology
 
03:11:55.309 --> 03:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
neutral um also we have this commission
 
03:11:58.229 --> 03:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
I think cat yo representative McGee youo
 
03:12:01.030 --> 03:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh on small modular reactors and some of
 
03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
these business
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
models are based on energy as a service
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
where the company will own maybe a 20
 
03:12:11.910 --> 03:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt micro reactor and sell the
 
03:12:11.920 --> 03:12:13.389 align:start position:0%
megawatt micro reactor and sell the
energy

03:12:13.389 --> 03:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:12:16.990 --> 03:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
um but do so within like the concept of
 
03:12:18.910 --> 03:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
like an industrial power zone or
 
03:12:22.269 --> 03:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
industrial park where you have large you
 
03:12:23.950 --> 03:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
know manufacturers or data centers or
 
03:12:26.750 --> 03:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it is who want to contract for
 
03:12:29.870 --> 03:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
that energy so this would enable offers
 
03:12:31.750 --> 03:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah off-takers right so this would
 
03:12:34.269 --> 03:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
enable lots of different scenarios it
 
03:12:37.269 --> 03:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
would enable experimentation that
 
03:12:40.590 --> 03:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the larger grid and in
 
03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
fact one of the requirements in the
 
03:12:45.150 --> 03:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
amend mment is to study the effect on
 
03:12:47.030 --> 03:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
resiliency of the rest of the git
 
03:12:48.990 --> 03:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
because we know I think you you guys
 
03:12:50.469 --> 03:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
heard from
 
03:12:54.510 --> 03:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
um uh the author of shorting the
 
03:12:57.750 --> 03:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
grid and she talked a lot about
 
03:13:00.229 --> 03:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
resiliency or or you know that you want
 
03:13:02.190 --> 03:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
to have your grid maintain capacity at
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
all times and so that idea of grid
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
resiliency is a big part of this study
 
03:13:11.550 --> 03:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
but

03:13:14.389 --> 03:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:13:15.870 --> 03:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that that brings to
 
03:13:18.590 --> 03:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
mind is the idea of whether or not there
 
03:13:21.190 --> 03:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be we you know this talk here
 
03:13:23.790 --> 03:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
about U interconnection with the main
 
03:13:26.910 --> 03:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
power grid um system reliability and
 
03:13:28.830 --> 03:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
operational impacts cost allocation
 
03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
coordination with utilities I'm
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
wondering whether or not there should be
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
whether there needs to be a directive to
 
03:13:36.790 --> 03:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
interact with the iso New England in
 
03:13:40.710 --> 03:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
terms of um their experience with micro
 
03:13:42.190 --> 03:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
grids that have already been set up in
 
03:13:44.590 --> 03:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
other plac places in the region and I I
 
03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
know that eversource has some you know
 
03:13:49.070 --> 03:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
has some there are several people
 
03:13:51.229 --> 03:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
probably in state that have experience
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
already with microG grids but I I guess
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
the point I would make is micr grids can
 
03:13:58.550 --> 03:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
serve different purposes but we we would
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
have to Define upfront I think uh
 
03:14:02.670 --> 03:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
through this study what kind of purposes
 
03:14:05.070 --> 03:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would like them to serve
 
03:14:06.870 --> 03:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
right and then then you'd also have to
 
03:14:09.830 --> 03:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
decide where and I think those kind of
 
03:14:12.990 --> 03:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
discussions come from leaders ship so
 
03:14:15.030 --> 03:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I feel like the way that
 
03:14:17.389 --> 03:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
the bill is written it's going to be
 
03:14:19.630 --> 03:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
sort of a pingpong for a while in terms
 
03:14:21.510 --> 03:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
of decision Mak you're speaking to me
 
03:14:22.710 --> 03:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
and I thought it was a representative
 
03:14:25.389 --> 03:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
Thomas I couldn't tell I'm sorry I I I
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
thought he said followup yeah I'm sorry
 
03:14:31.070 --> 03:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I I just clicked that you it
 
03:14:33.190 --> 03:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't represent I was looking at
 
03:14:36.750 --> 03:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
you go ahead I'm sorry yeah I I thank
 
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Thomas for giving me
 
03:14:43.070 --> 03:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
the floor um yeah so I
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
I guess we do this a lot right we have
 
03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
bills where we're kind of fishing we're
 
03:14:49.710 --> 03:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
saying you guys go find this out for us
 
03:14:51.070 --> 03:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
so we have more information to make a
 
03:14:52.670 --> 03:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
better decision or to figure out which
 
03:14:54.750 --> 03:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
way we want to go but I'm wondering
 
03:14:56.710 --> 03:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
whether the the language in the bill
 
03:15:00.670 --> 03:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
also needs to include um more than just
 
03:15:02.269 --> 03:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
the illusions on some of these things
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
but to sort of direct uh the department
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
of energy toward what it is we're trying
 
03:15:09.429 --> 03:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
to get out of micro grids right you you
 
03:15:11.070 --> 03:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple of things that you
 
03:15:12.910 --> 03:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
can get with micr grids
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
but I guess what is New Hampshire's
 
03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
interest in having micro grids is it to
 
03:15:19.710 --> 03:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
allow people to have energy that is
 
03:15:21.990 --> 03:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
Standalone so that they do not have to
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
interact with the Grid or is it uh to be
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
able to act as an asset that can
 
03:15:29.830 --> 03:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
interact with the Grid in times when
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
Peak demand is you know requiring that
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
we put more energy
 
03:15:37.630 --> 03:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
on yeah no I hear what you're saying
 
03:15:41.229 --> 03:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
um the uh it's my understanding that if
 
03:15:43.189 --> 03:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
you wanted to build your own micro grid
 
03:15:45.550 --> 03:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
if you had your own plot of land and you
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
could contract with other entities that
 
03:15:49.910 --> 03:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's already allowed um so this would
 
03:15:51.670 --> 03:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
be the point of the
 
03:15:53.670 --> 03:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
interconnection is really the critical
 
03:15:55.389 --> 03:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
thing and I think the department of
 
03:15:58.110 --> 03:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
energy has already done uh a study
 
03:16:00.510 --> 03:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
similar to this on interconnection
 
03:16:02.670 --> 03:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
process so that you know they're it's a
 
03:16:05.189 --> 03:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
technically challenging subject and you
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
need experts to um this is why we didn't
 
03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
create like a like a legislative
 
03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
commission um but we want to have you
 
03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:13.269 align:start position:0%
commission um but we want to have you
know

03:16:13.269 --> 03:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:16:16.229 --> 03:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
experts uh who understand these issues
 
03:16:17.950 --> 03:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
design it and I understand what you're
 
03:16:20.429 --> 03:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
saying that we want to direct them so a
 
03:16:22.150 --> 03:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
couple of things in the
 
03:16:27.469 --> 03:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:31.349 --> 03:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
page the role of microG grids would be
 
03:16:34.950 --> 03:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
the focus would be uh economic growth
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
clean energy
 
03:16:39.389 --> 03:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
Innovation and reliable electricity
 
03:16:42.030 --> 03:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
service I think those three things are
 
03:16:44.950 --> 03:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know key and and most of us could
 
03:16:47.229 --> 03:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
agree that they're important so if if
 
03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
you think there's a need to expand on
 
03:16:52.469 --> 03:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
that further I'd be open to you know
 
03:16:54.309 --> 03:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
suggestions or whatever the the
 
03:16:59.389 --> 03:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:02.429 --> 03:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
do representative Winnie Thomas thank
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um it's me
 
03:17:09.070 --> 03:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
talking um sort of to piggyback on uh
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative um McGee's question um do
 
03:17:15.590 --> 03:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
you see these micro grids eventually
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
leaving the regional grid is that the
 
03:17:21.710 --> 03:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of all this uh it was leaving no
 
03:17:23.349 --> 03:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
I think it's in it's the other way
 
03:17:26.189 --> 03:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
around um that they would be built out
 
03:17:28.269 --> 03:17:28.279 align:start position:0%
and then connected to the larger grid
 
03:17:30.429 --> 03:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
and okay and there's there will be
 
03:17:31.950 --> 03:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
requirements for that interconnection
 
03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
and one of those will be that they have
 
03:17:35.990 --> 03:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
to provide additional resiliency to the
 
03:17:39.469 --> 03:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
larger grid um they can't make the make
 
03:17:41.469 --> 03:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
our larger grid less stable it has to be
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
more stable so follow
 
03:17:49.429 --> 03:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
up thank you um so so this in essence
 
03:17:50.870 --> 03:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
building these microG grid I'm just
 
03:17:53.910 --> 03:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
trying to understand this um it's it's
 
03:17:57.309 --> 03:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
to provide services for outlying
 
03:17:59.309 --> 03:17:59.319 align:start position:0%
communities or or stuff like that they
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't have this cap capacity right now
 
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean it's hard to completely
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
imagine what the market might come up
 
03:18:10.870 --> 03:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
with but one thing that I that comes to
 
03:18:13.830 --> 03:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
mind in in my imag ination is this idea
 
03:18:16.590 --> 03:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
of an industrial power zone so let's say
 
03:18:19.030 --> 03:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
we have the Burgess power plant up in
 
03:18:20.590 --> 03:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
you know there there's need for power
 
03:18:23.950 --> 03:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
and jobs up in the North Country um and
 
03:18:26.030 --> 03:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
our electricity is is expensive it's
 
03:18:28.389 --> 03:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to manufacturing coming into
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
the state but if they could build a a a
 
03:18:33.469 --> 03:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
you know industrial park that had its
 
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
own generation it could be wind and
 
03:18:38.830 --> 03:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
solar and a battery uh Source right um
 
03:18:41.550 --> 03:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
that was self- sustaining uh and then if
 
03:18:43.229 --> 03:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
they wanted to have the additional
 
03:18:44.429 --> 03:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
because there it's a two-way street
 
03:18:45.790 --> 03:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
right if your grid connects to the
 
03:18:48.070 --> 03:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
larger grid you get the benefit of when
 
03:18:49.510 --> 03:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
you need power you can pull from the
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
larger grid um but it also should be
 
03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
required to provide additional
 
03:18:57.990 --> 03:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
resiliency the other way um and so you
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
know it's it would be beneficial for the
 
03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:10.389 --> 03:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
state um so in your explanation you keep
 
03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
talking about one company might have the
 
03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
capacity to do this so and I I see that
 
03:19:19.030 --> 03:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
in line 16 on page one it's the purpose
 
03:19:22.030 --> 03:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
of this commission to come up with
 
03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
definitions uh requirement definitions
 
03:19:28.150 --> 03:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
and requirements yeah yeah so um so a
 
03:19:30.269 --> 03:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
micro GD grid could be one or more is
 
03:19:33.469 --> 03:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
that correct one or more customers for L
 
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
of right it could be a it could be a a
 
03:19:37.050 --> 03:19:37.060 align:start position:0%
housing you know Community or it could
 
03:19:37.060 --> 03:19:38.189 align:start position:0%
housing you know Community or it could
[Music]

03:19:38.189 --> 03:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
be yeah right all right thank you so
 
03:19:43.510 --> 03:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
this is for the Department to kind of
 
03:19:45.830 --> 03:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
work out the details you know we heard
 
03:19:47.710 --> 03:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
back in February that this is a complex
 
03:19:50.389 --> 03:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
issue um but there's you know there's
 
03:19:52.750 --> 03:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
interest in moving the ball forward in
 
03:19:55.229 --> 03:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
this area but this would be a
 
03:19:56.830 --> 03:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the Department of
 
03:19:59.910 --> 03:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
energy and then it's up to the legisl at
 
03:20:01.469 --> 03:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
that point to to act on those
 
03:20:01.479 --> 03:20:02.830 align:start position:0%
that point to to act on those
recommendations

03:20:02.830 --> 03:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
03:20:05.830 --> 03:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
so uh I think I'll have a question here
 
03:20:05.840 --> 03:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
so uh I think I'll have a question here
um

03:20:07.590 --> 03:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:09.910 --> 03:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
so and I think this question was
 
03:20:12.229 --> 03:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
probably going to be asked again again
 
03:20:14.910 --> 03:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
for Department of energy
 
03:20:17.670 --> 03:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
but we have been talking about micr
 
03:20:19.950 --> 03:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
grids for several years now and we've
 
03:20:21.790 --> 03:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
been talking about studies for several
 
03:20:27.790 --> 03:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
years and I'm all for having this study
 
03:20:31.510 --> 03:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
um legislation really moves slow is
 
03:20:33.870 --> 03:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
there a way that we can
 
03:20:36.510 --> 03:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
accelerate um the beginnings of this I
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
mean we have 60 days after enactment
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
which um I'm not sure why we did 60 days
 
03:20:45.429 --> 03:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
and then 60 days for Preparation which
 
03:20:49.269 --> 03:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh possibly can be explained by by Doe
 
03:20:51.150 --> 03:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
is there any other way that we can speed
 
03:20:53.389 --> 03:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
this up so we can get the survey go the
 
03:20:55.790 --> 03:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
um the study going
 
03:20:58.269 --> 03:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
faster that would be a question for doe
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
I think the 60 days effective date was
 
03:21:02.950 --> 03:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
just the default from OS um I didn't
 
03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
give them any instruction on on that
 
03:21:06.910 --> 03:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
date so but I I would leave it up to the
 
03:21:09.189 --> 03:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
department they have their own you know
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
task list and you know resource uh
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
constraint so I lead up to them I will
 
03:21:16.110 --> 03:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
offer I don't know if ever source is in
 
03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
the room but they had an idea to kind of
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
have it a more immediate approach where
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
they would uh allow for utilities to do
 
03:21:29.550 --> 03:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
up to a certain minimum uh I think it
 
03:21:32.189 --> 03:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
was like three uh micro grid projects
 
03:21:34.830 --> 03:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
like begin them in the queue um but
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
there's still some undefined things that
 
03:21:39.030 --> 03:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh I believe I don't want to speak for
 
03:21:41.550 --> 03:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
anyone in particular but that the
 
03:21:44.429 --> 03:21:44.439 align:start position:0%
department Department felt um you know
 
03:21:47.670 --> 03:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
need needed some more uh thought behind
 
03:21:49.590 --> 03:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
it before we launched something like
 
03:21:50.670 --> 03:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
that but you'll
 
03:21:56.870 --> 03:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:59.910 --> 03:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
it yeah it's uh line
 
03:22:04.389 --> 03:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
19 uh letter C evaluation criteria and
 
03:22:06.309 --> 03:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
approval process for utilities to
 
03:22:09.030 --> 03:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
propose a limited number of microG good
 
03:22:11.389 --> 03:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
pilot projects to the Public Utilities
 
03:22:13.469 --> 03:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
Commission annually so that was sort of
 
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
like uh taking ever sources input and
 
03:22:20.229 --> 03:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
you know making uh accommodations for
 
03:22:23.550 --> 03:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
that pilot that pilot idea but I hear
 
03:22:25.830 --> 03:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
what you're saying it this is this would
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
be a longer process than uh you know I
 
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
like immediate results but I can also
 
03:22:34.030 --> 03:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
wait for stuff to happen later you
 
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
know unless anyone has a question
 
03:22:39.950 --> 03:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
specifically for the representative um
 
03:22:42.309 --> 03:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
or is tactical is it
 
03:22:45.229 --> 03:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
you do okay because I I know that Doe
 
03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
will want to get up and talk about uh
 
03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
this as well so let's uh let's keep it a
 
03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
question so the representative can
 
03:22:54.750 --> 03:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
answer yeah representative wi my seat's
 
03:22:58.630 --> 03:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
getting hotter and hotter thank you um
 
03:23:01.309 --> 03:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
so um just on line 31 it says that they
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
will report the findings and
 
03:23:06.030 --> 03:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:08.710 --> 03:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
legislature the entire legislature or
 
03:23:11.469 --> 03:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
this committee who who do they report
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
this too I think traditionally it goes
 
03:23:15.750 --> 03:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
to like the Senate President and the
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and the governor
 
03:23:19.870 --> 03:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
and the state librarian and okay all
 
03:23:21.229 --> 03:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
right the house Clerk and then they
 
03:23:23.870 --> 03:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
distribute it it's not specific in here
 
03:23:27.790 --> 03:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:31.269 --> 03:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
point go ahead thank you Mr chair thank
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
you representative Amon again um I sent
 
03:23:36.309 --> 03:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
an email around to folks because when I
 
03:23:39.030 --> 03:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
looked at the update that came to all of
 
03:23:40.990 --> 03:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
us here on the committee my first
 
03:23:42.550 --> 03:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
thought was that that a lot of times
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
what delays us is that we don't have any
 
03:23:46.510 --> 03:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
funding source we don't have any way to
 
03:23:48.349 --> 03:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
get things going and then we have to
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
come back around and convince everybody
 
03:23:52.990 --> 03:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
that there's um value in doing something
 
03:23:54.750 --> 03:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
that we just spent time studying so we
 
03:23:57.070 --> 03:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
could determine that there was a value
 
03:24:00.070 --> 03:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
so my thought is that I know that right
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
now we get um a newsletter a monthly
 
03:24:06.150 --> 03:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
newsletter from doe which is chalk full
 
03:24:08.670 --> 03:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
of links and references to federal
 
03:24:10.630 --> 03:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
dollars that are available or federal
 
03:24:12.550 --> 03:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
programs that we
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
um in the middle of putting in
 
03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
applications for in order to help us
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
with transitioning our Energy Systems
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
and it's basically designed to give us a
 
03:24:23.950 --> 03:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
leg up in money that we wouldn't be
 
03:24:26.309 --> 03:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
putting in otherwise right so when I saw
 
03:24:29.870 --> 03:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
this bill my first thought was do should
 
03:24:31.510 --> 03:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
we add anything in here and we can ask
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
this of doe as well that um directs them
 
03:24:38.429 --> 03:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're referring to
 
03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
those monies that are available with
 
03:24:42.510 --> 03:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
Mind's Eye to this Pro you know to this
 
03:24:44.309 --> 03:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
project so when they come back to us
 
03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
with recommendations perhaps we can be
 
03:24:50.670 --> 03:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
leveraging funding that we're trying to
 
03:24:52.870 --> 03:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
secure now like try and marry them so
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's not up to us to try and figure out
 
03:24:56.630 --> 03:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
how to put it together no I think that
 
03:25:00.349 --> 03:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
would be a good addition um we had uh on
 
03:25:02.269 --> 03:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
our on our Advanced nuclear commission
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
we had the department the US Department
 
03:25:07.269 --> 03:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
of energy uh their office of nuclear
 
03:25:09.070 --> 03:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
energy we had representatives from the
 
03:25:11.189 --> 03:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
gain program which is a so there's a lot
 
03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
of ederal funding for you know Advanced
 
03:25:17.429 --> 03:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
nuclear but clean energy in general um
 
03:25:18.790 --> 03:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
and so you I've heard firsthand that
 
03:25:21.790 --> 03:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:29.950 --> 03:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
you we probably ask to we when they come
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
up here and everything okay and uh
 
03:25:34.710 --> 03:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you representative and
 
03:25:36.990 --> 03:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
um I guess by popular demand we could
 
03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
ask Department of energy to step forward
 
03:25:41.550 --> 03:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
and tell us the words that they put in
 
03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:53.510 --> 03:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee for the
 
03:25:56.630 --> 03:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
record my name is Chris Elms I'm the
 
03:25:57.870 --> 03:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
03:25:59.349 --> 03:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and I'm joined by
 
03:26:01.269 --> 03:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
Mark Tuscano who's a utility analyst in
 
03:26:03.870 --> 03:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
our regulatory Support Division um you
 
03:26:06.349 --> 03:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
know we are are supportive of this
 
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um we think it's a really good
 
03:26:11.469 --> 03:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to resolve some of the
 
03:26:14.030 --> 03:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had expressed uh you
 
03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
know back in February with the
 
03:26:17.790 --> 03:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill uh developing micro
 
03:26:21.070 --> 03:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
grids is a there are a lot of technical
 
03:26:23.870 --> 03:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
complexities that
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
um we believe that that the rirs of New
 
03:26:29.870 --> 03:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be best served by being
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
able to resolve prior to the
 
03:26:35.910 --> 03:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
implementation of Pilots or um some new
 
03:26:38.429 --> 03:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
filings related to micro grids you know
 
03:26:40.670 --> 03:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
anything from the size of the micro grid
 
03:26:43.590 --> 03:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
to the the ownership the relationship
 
03:26:46.269 --> 03:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
between you know utilities and maybe you
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
know third- party uh folks um the
 
03:26:51.750 --> 03:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
operation the
 
03:26:53.790 --> 03:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
interconnection uh the relationship with
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
ISO cyber security there there are a a
 
03:26:59.070 --> 03:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
lot of issues that that could come up
 
03:27:00.510 --> 03:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
and that if they're not resolved prior
 
03:27:02.429 --> 03:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
to that implementation of a pilot could
 
03:27:04.469 --> 03:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
lead us to a situation where you know
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
rars would be on the hook for um you
 
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
know stranded costs related to a a a
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
pilot that didn't you know bear fruit so
 
03:27:16.070 --> 03:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh we we worked with representative
 
03:27:19.710 --> 03:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
Ammon on um developing you know this
 
03:27:22.070 --> 03:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
directive uh that the department would
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
undertake an investigative proceeding
 
03:27:26.830 --> 03:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
where we would look at you know all
 
03:27:29.830 --> 03:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
these issues and more um you know
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of value in having that
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
legislative Direction uh in in you know
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
initiating an investigative proceeding
 
03:27:40.590 --> 03:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
like this uh and we we think that it
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
would uh well served Rays to allow us to
 
03:27:46.349 --> 03:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh take a look to work with the relevant
 
03:27:49.269 --> 03:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
entities um you know like ISO like the
 
03:27:52.110 --> 03:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
utilities various stakeholders uh and
 
03:27:53.710 --> 03:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
then be able to bring forward
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations on how to resolve those
 
03:27:58.510 --> 03:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
technical complexities um you know to
 
03:28:01.710 --> 03:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
the question of Direction on on purpose
 
03:28:04.229 --> 03:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
you know we are more agnostic as to why
 
03:28:06.510 --> 03:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
somebody might want to do a micro grid
 
03:28:08.309 --> 03:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
that' be interconnected to the grid I
 
03:28:09.590 --> 03:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
think you know there are a lot of
 
03:28:11.429 --> 03:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
benefits and they were highlighted we
 
03:28:13.790 --> 03:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see that as necessarily our
 
03:28:16.510 --> 03:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
role to tell you why they should do it
 
03:28:18.830 --> 03:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
our role would be to tell you how to do
 
03:28:21.469 --> 03:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
whatever folks want to do now some of
 
03:28:23.229 --> 03:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
this it it might need further
 
03:28:25.229 --> 03:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
legislation to implement Pilots it might
 
03:28:27.070 --> 03:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
be something that we we have existing
 
03:28:28.870 --> 03:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
authority to bring before the commission
 
03:28:31.870 --> 03:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
or other companies might so that's why
 
03:28:34.229 --> 03:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
um you know you saw a language that
 
03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
directs us to make recommendations to
 
03:28:38.110 --> 03:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
both the legislature and to the
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
commission um because you know there
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
there is just that possibility that it
 
03:28:44.630 --> 03:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
would fall within existing authorities I
 
03:28:46.389 --> 03:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
will say in on the topics of microG
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
grids there is not at this time a great
 
03:28:50.910 --> 03:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
deal of institutional knowledge in the
 
03:28:53.910 --> 03:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
state especially in the regulatory realm
 
03:28:55.950 --> 03:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
on on a lot of these issues and that's
 
03:28:57.710 --> 03:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
something that we see as a real
 
03:29:00.910 --> 03:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity through this bill to develop
 
03:29:03.389 --> 03:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
uh so that when we proceed with these
 
03:29:05.670 --> 03:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
Pilots or whatever would come out of um
 
03:29:07.750 --> 03:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
the invent the eventual investigative
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
proceeding that it's um off on the right
 
03:29:13.150 --> 03:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
foot right that we have an opportunity
 
03:29:15.790 --> 03:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
to you know take that purpose of a pilot
 
03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
which really should be to develop
 
03:29:19.349 --> 03:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge and you know learn some best
 
03:29:21.550 --> 03:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
practices see what works for us what
 
03:29:23.389 --> 03:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for us and then develop
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
that on a broader scale right a pilot
 
03:29:28.830 --> 03:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
isn't just a pilot um as the end goal
 
03:29:32.309 --> 03:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
you know so uh if if we don't you know
 
03:29:34.510 --> 03:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
have a foundation of knowledge leading
 
03:29:35.870 --> 03:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
into those Pilots we won't even really
 
03:29:37.630 --> 03:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
know what to look for what to account
 
03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
for and what data might be most useful
 
03:29:42.389 --> 03:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
to us so we see this is a really uh good
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity that if the legislature
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
wants to to move the state in a
 
03:29:49.150 --> 03:29:49.160 align:start position:0%
direction where micro grids are more
 
03:29:51.469 --> 03:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
prevalent that this gives us the
 
03:29:54.110 --> 03:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
direction to do the work um and have the
 
03:29:56.070 --> 03:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
resources able to provide that
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
Foundation uh we do see this bill as
 
03:30:00.750 --> 03:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
having as as allowing us to access the
 
03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
resources we would need uh to to move
 
03:30:05.429 --> 03:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
forward with that and um so we're we
 
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
happy to support it uh if you want to
 
03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
move forward with a micro Grid
 
03:30:12.790 --> 03:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
bill i' like to start off with a
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
question first
 
03:30:17.990 --> 03:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
um at the risk of sounding
 
03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:19.870 align:start position:0%
um at the risk of sounding
administrative

03:30:19.870 --> 03:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
03:30:24.510 --> 03:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
um us here and the folks here probably
 
03:30:27.910 --> 03:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
have a fairly a fairly good idea of what
 
03:30:33.550 --> 03:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
a micro grid is um I'm wondering I guess
 
03:30:36.670 --> 03:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
the question is why in this amendment
 
03:30:40.510 --> 03:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
would it not have been a um a more
 
03:30:40.520 --> 03:30:41.550 align:start position:0%
would it not have been a um a more
descriptive

03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
descriptive
 
03:30:45.910 --> 03:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
use of text if we if you could have led
 
03:30:51.150 --> 03:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
with just a very brief uh description of
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
what micr grids are and maybe a
 
03:30:57.870 --> 03:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
generalized listing of their pros and
 
03:31:00.870 --> 03:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
cons so people would have a good idea of
 
03:31:03.910 --> 03:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about uh and I I know
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
that the the purpose of the bill is to
 
03:31:08.189 --> 03:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
go and investigate and see how it could
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
affect us here and what all the
 
03:31:13.630 --> 03:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
implications are but what when the
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislator goes to vote on this not
 
03:31:17.269 --> 03:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to know what a microG
 
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
grid really is just kind of wondering if
 
03:31:23.510 --> 03:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
that might not be useful sure and and I
 
03:31:25.030 --> 03:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good question and I
 
03:31:27.790 --> 03:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
think it's a certainly a fair point to
 
03:31:31.070 --> 03:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
raise you know that balance between um
 
03:31:33.429 --> 03:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
what is necessary in statutory language
 
03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
but what's useful in explaining that
 
03:31:37.309 --> 03:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
right so that's that is something to to
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
think about and if if the legislature
 
03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to add a sort of a a finding
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
section um that had maybe more of that
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
information we'd be happy to you know
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
work with folks on that uh you know we
 
03:31:52.269 --> 03:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
see the language as it is here you know
 
03:31:54.469 --> 03:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
purely from that implementation
 
03:31:56.469 --> 03:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
statutory sense that we we know what
 
03:31:58.510 --> 03:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
you're asking of us with this language
 
03:32:00.750 --> 03:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
and we could Implement that in terms of
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
having the legislature have um further
 
03:32:08.790 --> 03:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
Clarity for folks who um might not be as
 
03:32:11.590 --> 03:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know focused on this issue area
 
03:32:14.110 --> 03:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh we would see that as up up to the
 
03:32:15.990 --> 03:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislature but would be happy to you
 
03:32:18.030 --> 03:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
know work with folks on
 
03:32:20.429 --> 03:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you perhaps something
 
03:32:26.830 --> 03:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:26.840 --> 03:32:28.389 align:start position:0%
 
perhaps

03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
Binky thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
03:32:36.349 --> 03:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
Elms for taking my question um so I
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you said and I
 
03:32:41.229 --> 03:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate the bill and um I think it's
 
03:32:43.870 --> 03:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing for us to be doing my
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
question is it does come back to those
 
03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
findings around the values of a micro
 
03:32:50.150 --> 03:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
grid the why are we doing the microG
 
03:32:53.309 --> 03:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
grid I know that we've had a lot of um
 
03:32:56.429 --> 03:32:56.439 align:start position:0%
discussion around supporting nonprofits
 
03:32:58.189 --> 03:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
who want to try and put in installations
 
03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
that will help them lower their costs
 
03:33:03.590 --> 03:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the publicly supported
 
03:33:06.349 --> 03:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
State facilities and campuses around the
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
state uh were just hit really hard with
 
03:33:12.550 --> 03:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
you know the the expenses of electricity
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the in the past year and so the
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
conversation comes back to I know with
 
03:33:22.469 --> 03:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
the UNA un micro grid uh pilot which was
 
03:33:24.189 --> 03:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
anticipated for some time when I was
 
03:33:25.189 --> 03:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
first in the
 
03:33:28.630 --> 03:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislature uh their point was to say
 
03:33:32.830 --> 03:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
when when we have um a shortage or a
 
03:33:34.990 --> 03:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
blackout or you know a short short
 
03:33:36.910 --> 03:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
period of time after a storm where power
 
03:33:39.150 --> 03:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
goes out we want to be self-sufficient
 
03:33:41.790 --> 03:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
right we want to have all of our
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
primary um you know electric uh
 
03:33:47.429 --> 03:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure available to us so we
 
03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to size it based on being
 
03:33:53.229 --> 03:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
able to do that and and I think we have
 
03:33:56.510 --> 03:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
other infrastructure like hospitals
 
03:33:58.469 --> 03:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
right who have expressed the fact that
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
they would like some way to be more
 
03:34:02.830 --> 03:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
secure so everybody right now pretty
 
03:34:06.070 --> 03:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
much has um generators in New Hampshire
 
03:34:08.229 --> 03:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
right we all know what that's like um
 
03:34:10.349 --> 03:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
and I think I think of the mic micro
 
03:34:13.950 --> 03:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
grid as a way to provide greater
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
security to people Beyond you know
 
03:34:19.710 --> 03:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
beyond the generator right it's a it
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's so maybe Mr Tuscana could talk a
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
little bit about about micro grids in
 
03:34:27.750 --> 03:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
terms of what value they bring to the
 
03:34:31.870 --> 03:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
table if if a campus or a business or a
 
03:34:35.189 --> 03:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
um what did you say uh you know
 
03:34:39.429 --> 03:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
corporate entity uh has one available to
 
03:34:41.870 --> 03:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
them so so that maybe we maybe the
 
03:34:43.309 --> 03:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
legislature or this committee
 
03:34:45.189 --> 03:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
specifically would be able to understand
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
when we get the report back what we
 
03:34:50.469 --> 03:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
would be looking to solve for in terms
 
03:34:52.030 --> 03:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
of where we might be interested in
 
03:34:55.229 --> 03:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
having Pilots no I think that's a valid
 
03:34:57.429 --> 03:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
point I think you know um the way that
 
03:34:59.710 --> 03:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
we would look at this as I said before
 
03:35:02.790 --> 03:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know the actual policy goal is
 
03:35:05.309 --> 03:35:05.319 align:start position:0%
something that we'd be more agnostic on
 
03:35:07.830 --> 03:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
but it this this legislation does list
 
03:35:09.630 --> 03:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
you know uh reliability I don't know if
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
we use the word Brazilian it's a
 
03:35:13.469 --> 03:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
interesting word but you know that as a
 
03:35:17.630 --> 03:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
goal it clean energy it um lower costs
 
03:35:20.429 --> 03:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
whatever we would see our role as really
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
helping to figure out what would enable
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
that micro grid for whatever purpose I
 
03:35:29.150 --> 03:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
will ask uh Mark to speak a little bit
 
03:35:31.590 --> 03:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
about his experience um and I I I think
 
03:35:34.150 --> 03:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
you'll find it Illuminating um but but
 
03:35:36.710 --> 03:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
it he can highlight some of the the the
 
03:35:38.910 --> 03:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
the complexities and the challenges that
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating
 
03:35:43.830 --> 03:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
um I think the only point I was trying
 
03:35:44.950 --> 03:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
to make and I kind of went around the
 
03:35:46.590 --> 03:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
world to make it was that I was
 
03:35:48.389 --> 03:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
wondering whether we
 
03:35:52.229 --> 03:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
should um in any way call out the idea
 
03:35:54.030 --> 03:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
of a
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
state facility for a pilot you know as a
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
way to C cut cost for the state as well
 
03:36:03.550 --> 03:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that's obviously up
 
03:36:05.950 --> 03:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
to your discretion whether or not you
 
03:36:08.429 --> 03:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
want to implement those I I we do we
 
03:36:10.030 --> 03:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
took the position and and and would
 
03:36:12.349 --> 03:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
continue take the position that we think
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
um an investigative proceeding would be
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
very beneficial in um leading to The
 
03:36:19.830 --> 03:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
Next Step whatever that next step might
 
03:36:22.429 --> 03:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
be and maybe it's a pilot that's um on
 
03:36:24.189 --> 03:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
the you know that the state undertakes
 
03:36:26.950 --> 03:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
maybe it's something else um that's
 
03:36:29.150 --> 03:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
something that we would hope to discover
 
03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
and and and hope our investigative
 
03:36:33.189 --> 03:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
proceeding could illuminate maybe even
 
03:36:36.910 --> 03:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
what a better path might be um I am
 
03:36:38.429 --> 03:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
going to ask Mark just to talk a little
 
03:36:40.910 --> 03:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
bit about what he's seen with this I I
 
03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful before you do
 
03:36:45.510 --> 03:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
that so I make sure did you have a
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
question representative Wendy Thomas for
 
03:36:51.510 --> 03:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
Chris or for uh no it's it's yeah for
 
03:36:55.710 --> 03:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
Chris um so thank you thank you um my
 
03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
question is is that there's no fiscal
 
03:36:59.630 --> 03:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
note attached to this and we're
 
03:37:01.269 --> 03:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
constantly hearing from the Department
 
03:37:02.830 --> 03:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
of energy that you don't have the staff
 
03:37:05.229 --> 03:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
you don't have the funds can you assure
 
03:37:07.189 --> 03:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
us that you have the staff and the funds
 
03:37:11.189 --> 03:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
to absorb this this committee and if not
 
03:37:14.030 --> 03:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
can you estimate a cost please yeah so
 
03:37:16.269 --> 03:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh I appreciate that question um just
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
sort of to you know reiterate a point
 
03:37:20.349 --> 03:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
we' we've made we don't control the
 
03:37:22.510 --> 03:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note process so once an amendment
 
03:37:25.870 --> 03:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
is adopted and brought forward uh Os or
 
03:37:27.990 --> 03:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
LBA will reach out to us and provide us
 
03:37:30.189 --> 03:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
a a fiscal worksheet which we'll fill
 
03:37:33.030 --> 03:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
out and make uh some of those estimates
 
03:37:37.150 --> 03:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
uh we would see an ability to um assess
 
03:37:40.150 --> 03:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
the costs of a consultant to rate payers
 
03:37:42.510 --> 03:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
you know you know through this under our
 
03:37:44.110 --> 03:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
existing statutory Authority which we
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
use uh in a variety of circumstances
 
03:37:51.150 --> 03:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
with with proceedings um I couldn't give
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
you an estimate today on that um we'd
 
03:37:56.750 --> 03:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
have to talk to our budget folks uh but
 
03:37:58.349 --> 03:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
but we would see that we have the
 
03:38:00.870 --> 03:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to do so I can't
 
03:38:02.309 --> 03:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
tell you what the number
 
03:38:04.710 --> 03:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
is thank
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
you I've got I just want to follow up to
 
03:38:08.910 --> 03:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
with tech
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
question can you at least assure us that
 
03:38:13.309 --> 03:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
the answer to
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
the physical note would not be
 
03:38:21.070 --> 03:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
indeterminate well you know uh we do uh
 
03:38:23.550 --> 03:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
pursue you know competitive solicitation
 
03:38:25.870 --> 03:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
for consultants and obviously in the
 
03:38:29.870 --> 03:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
energy field there is a uh it's a it's a
 
03:38:34.670 --> 03:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
very Niche um you know area of expertise
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
involved with with microgrid so I can't
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
tell you that there's a um there there's
 
03:38:42.630 --> 03:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
just a service where we can go and say
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
this will cost $100,000 exactly uh we
 
03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
would undergo competitive solicitation
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately the answer would
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
probably be indeterminate but we would
 
03:38:54.630 --> 03:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
probably be able to give you a range of
 
03:38:57.229 --> 03:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
estimates based on what we've seen for
 
03:38:57.239 --> 03:38:59.349 align:start position:0%
estimates based on what we've seen for
similar

03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
similar
 
03:39:02.910 --> 03:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
03:39:09.150 --> 03:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
chairman so following up on on a
 
03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
question representative McGee asked
 
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon we're looking at 60
 
03:39:17.670 --> 03:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
days from enactment and then another 120
 
03:39:21.389 --> 03:39:21.399 align:start position:0%
days from that for this proceeding to
 
03:39:23.990 --> 03:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
spin up so that's a half a year is a
 
03:39:26.070 --> 03:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
half a year I me do you really need half
 
03:39:26.080 --> 03:39:26.790 align:start position:0%
half a year I me do you really need half
a

03:39:26.790 --> 03:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:39:30.110 --> 03:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
year well um you know the more time the
 
03:39:32.349 --> 03:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
better and I guess from our perspective
 
03:39:35.790 --> 03:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
we we do see this as you know um a
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
balance between speed and having that
 
03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
Firm Foundation to move forward with
 
03:39:41.429 --> 03:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
with future things now look New
 
03:39:43.389 --> 03:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not an easy place to
 
03:39:45.469 --> 03:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
procure uh consultants and they go
 
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
through that process and I think you're
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
all well aware of what we have to go
 
03:39:50.750 --> 03:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
through with a governor and councel
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
process um and then in just the state
 
03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
procurement and that really can take
 
03:39:58.830 --> 03:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
several months um from you know scoping
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
out the investigation then creating an
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
RFP to uh select the right you know find
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
the right attributes and the right
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
expertise going out for an appropriate
 
03:40:10.830 --> 03:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
amount of time reviewing the bids that
 
03:40:14.670 --> 03:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
come in selecting the proper uh you know
 
03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
consultant balancing their expertise and
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
cost coming through the governor and
 
03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
Council process getting that approval
 
03:40:23.469 --> 03:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
starting the investigation um you know
 
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
that that really does eat up a lot of
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
time we see the benefit of having that
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
lead time as being able to frontload a
 
03:40:30.830 --> 03:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
lot of that work so once the
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
investigation is initiated we don't have
 
03:40:37.189 --> 03:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
to say um okay let's now spend the next
 
03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
four months getting a consultant before
 
03:40:42.670 --> 03:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
we can really even dive into this um you
 
03:40:45.910 --> 03:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
know I I think if you wanted to move up
 
03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
the initiation of it it's something that
 
03:40:49.510 --> 03:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
you could do we would ask I think for
 
03:40:51.710 --> 03:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
probably more than a year at that point
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
unless you you know we could rush it we
 
03:40:56.189 --> 03:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
can we can get the job done and whatever
 
03:41:00.790 --> 03:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
time uh is given to us it'll just be a a
 
03:41:03.510 --> 03:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
product that is the product of a rushed
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know process so again it's not meant
 
03:41:07.590 --> 03:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
to delay anything it's just you know the
 
03:41:10.189 --> 03:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
stay process is what it is and we want
 
03:41:13.070 --> 03:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
to work within that to be effective for
 
03:41:15.349 --> 03:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
repairs just keep it under
 
03:41:18.990 --> 03:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
10,000 just that'll be uh quite oh yeah
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah then we wouldn't have to go to
 
03:41:32.429 --> 03:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:34.349 --> 03:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
Council I'll give you just since I'm
 
03:41:36.349 --> 03:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
here I I'll make it make it real quick
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh but we are doing an investigation
 
03:41:39.269 --> 03:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
right now into interconnect as you
 
03:41:40.990 --> 03:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
probably know inter interconnection
 
03:41:43.630 --> 03:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
procedures for the state um and to
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
Chris's Point these things take time you
 
03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
know you have participants you got
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
feedback you got to solicit comments and
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
everything else and that's after you
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
have the consultant on board and we do
 
03:41:54.030 --> 03:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
not have anybody on staff right now
 
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's well verse enough in this uh to
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
do it justice based on the scope I give
 
03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of my background you
 
03:42:03.149 --> 03:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate where I come from um spent
 
03:42:04.830 --> 03:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
about 30 years at Brook Haven National
 
03:42:06.550 --> 03:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
Laboratory that's a department of energy
 
03:42:10.189 --> 03:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
research facility um so we are all we
 
03:42:11.630 --> 03:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
weren't a micro grid but my scientists
 
03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
wanted us to be a microG grid I was on a
 
03:42:14.830 --> 03:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
facility side of the house so the energy
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
and Facilities keeping the lights on and
 
03:42:18.910 --> 03:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
and the steam flowing all the good
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
things like that and uh we're 60
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
megawatt load so it's a big facility and
 
03:42:27.389 --> 03:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
the plan was my scientists that worked
 
03:42:29.149 --> 03:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
there the PHD type folks wanted to have
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
a microG grid and they were after me for
 
03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
many many years to get a micro grid
 
03:42:36.870 --> 03:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
going it's no easy task for all the
 
03:42:37.950 --> 03:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
things that you've already heard a
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
little bit and you'll find out from part
 
03:42:41.389 --> 03:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
of this investig ation and technically
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's not difficult it's more the
 
03:42:45.349 --> 03:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and the the the process
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's the real difficult part and I
 
03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
just want to mention that it's to my
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
understanding there are only two states
 
03:42:51.670 --> 03:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
right now that even have tariff
 
03:42:53.070 --> 03:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions for microG grids and that's
 
03:42:56.349 --> 03:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
California and Hawaii so this is up and
 
03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
cominging it's new quote unquote even
 
03:42:59.110 --> 03:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
though micro grids have been around
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
forever every hospital as you mentioned
 
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
before everybody's got a backup
 
03:43:03.630 --> 03:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
generator technically is kind of a micro
 
03:43:05.830 --> 03:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
grid anyway but now you need to come up
 
03:43:08.429 --> 03:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
with the process and the regulatory
 
03:43:10.189 --> 03:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
framework that allow these things to
 
03:43:12.030 --> 03:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
work and function without causing
 
03:43:13.469 --> 03:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
problems so that's where most of the
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
time will most likely be spent um but I
 
03:43:17.790 --> 03:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
I did spend a considerable about amount
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
of time trying to put those things in
 
03:43:21.070 --> 03:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
play and as I mentioned the technical
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
part was actually much easier than the
 
03:43:28.149 --> 03:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:32.349 --> 03:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
stuff represent McGee thank you uh Mr
 
03:43:34.910 --> 03:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
chairman yes and thank you Mr tscan for
 
03:43:38.189 --> 03:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is
 
03:43:41.389 --> 03:43:41.399 align:start position:0%
around whether or not you you think this
 
03:43:43.149 --> 03:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
this report should
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
include uh where the greatest benefits
 
03:43:49.389 --> 03:43:49.399 align:start position:0%
of H of placing micro grids within the
 
03:43:52.110 --> 03:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
state whether it's by sector or by
 
03:43:54.990 --> 03:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
region would be included in any results
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
that we would receive which would be
 
03:43:58.750 --> 03:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
helpful to us I think because we we've
 
03:44:00.750 --> 03:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
got public we've got private sector
 
03:44:03.429 --> 03:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
we've got individuals we've got you
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
know so having an idea of where where we
 
03:44:10.110 --> 03:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
should go next might be something that
 
03:44:13.189 --> 03:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
your report could help us with it's a
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
very good question and it's a very good
 
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
point I think you know the balance
 
03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
between the scope of the investigation
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
so that it can be effective and you know
 
03:44:24.189 --> 03:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
Finding as much information as possible
 
03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
you know the uh the the proceeding could
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
look at every possible aspect but but
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
every possible aspect might not be
 
03:44:33.670 --> 03:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to move forward with microG
 
03:44:35.750 --> 03:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
grids once we're able to you know focus
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
on those things that are the true
 
03:44:39.550 --> 03:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
hurdles so I think we'd want to have
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
some further conversations about whether
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
or not geography is one of those sort of
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
um hurdles where it would be best to
 
03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
overcome or if that would be economic
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
and sort of the the scope of what we're
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
talking about here um I don't know Mark
 
03:44:54.070 --> 03:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
if you have anything to say on that
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
topic um I I agree I think that would be
 
03:44:58.389 --> 03:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
nice if we could find you know that
 
03:44:59.830 --> 03:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
could be part of it is to where would be
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
the biggest benefit I mean that's the
 
03:45:03.030 --> 03:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
intent of of doing this in the first
 
03:45:03.040 --> 03:45:04.550 align:start position:0%
intent of of doing this in the first
place

03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:45:08.110 --> 03:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
um in past discussions we had you know
 
03:45:10.189 --> 03:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
resiliency is a word that nobody can yet
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
fully Define as you all know in terms of
 
03:45:16.110 --> 03:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
a metrics um but the idea that you would
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
Target micr grids for critical type
 
03:45:20.070 --> 03:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
facilities as you mentioned before
 
03:45:22.269 --> 03:45:22.279 align:start position:0%
hospitals or or security type things and
 
03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
things of that nature um in my mind this
 
03:45:27.750 --> 03:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know you you get into as Chris
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned before you know what direction
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
would be from a you know we're AG
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
agnostic so to speak um in terms of it
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
we just want to identify the issues that
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
have to be addressed in terms of
 
03:45:39.389 --> 03:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
priorities and where they would go I you
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's an area that I'd be
 
03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh not a place that I could really weigh
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
in on and just to go on that I I do
 
03:45:50.189 --> 03:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
think you know that's something that
 
03:45:52.189 --> 03:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
might fall into evaluation criteria that
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
the Pu might want to look at um when
 
03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
approving micr grids and how that plays
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
into reliability or whatever the goal
 
03:46:02.950 --> 03:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
might be um I I I could see some
 
03:46:04.630 --> 03:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
conversation about including geography
 
03:46:07.389 --> 03:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
as as part of that followup thank you
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and the
 
03:46:10.830 --> 03:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
followup would be to go back to the
 
03:46:12.670 --> 03:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
beginning of where I mentioned that I
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
had sent a note out to the committee
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
just stating that I wanted to know if
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
doe could also be responsible for or
 
03:46:21.550 --> 03:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
whether we have to put it in here to
 
03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
make it so uh figuring out whether there
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
is any money that's coming from the
 
03:46:29.030 --> 03:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
federal government to the state now that
 
03:46:30.910 --> 03:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
could be leveraged because it seems like
 
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
the timing of this bill may be just off
 
03:46:37.469 --> 03:46:37.479 align:start position:0%
enough that you know my understanding is
 
03:46:39.630 --> 03:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
the IRA funding goes for 10 years and in
 
03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
other words it's designed to provide
 
03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
some consistency so people can put in
 
03:46:46.630 --> 03:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
projects at various stages but I would
 
03:46:48.189 --> 03:46:48.199 align:start position:0%
think that it would be really helpful if
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
this bill also instructed the doe to let
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
us know whereas you're a lot more
 
03:46:56.790 --> 03:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with whether there are federal
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
dollars that could be leveraged for any
 
03:47:01.110 --> 03:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
initial pilot to make it more of a
 
03:47:04.750 --> 03:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
reality so yeah absolutely good question
 
03:47:06.189 --> 03:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think you need to include that
 
03:47:08.149 --> 03:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
in the in the language we are looking at
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
those opportunities uh if you if you
 
03:47:13.229 --> 03:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to direct us to do so that that
 
03:47:15.630 --> 03:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly okay we are constantly
 
03:47:18.030 --> 03:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
looking for federal opportunities we
 
03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
understand the mission and uh know that
 
03:47:21.910 --> 03:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire is a state where we
 
03:47:23.630 --> 03:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
want to you know leverage opportunities
 
03:47:25.950 --> 03:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
where we can find them um you know
 
03:47:27.269 --> 03:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
coming to mind you know I think you
 
03:47:30.870 --> 03:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
raised a good point we just got uh 7
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
million 6.6 million for the what is it
 
03:47:37.830 --> 03:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
the 40101 d uh grid resiliency grants
 
03:47:39.870 --> 03:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
those are fiveyear we got the first two
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
years of a five-year Grant um you know
 
03:47:44.710 --> 03:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
there are other opportunities where
 
03:47:46.830 --> 03:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
something like this might be able to you
 
03:47:49.750 --> 03:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
know say uh bid into an RFP or or or
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
what have you um I don't know any off
 
03:47:53.790 --> 03:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
the top of my head where mic that are
 
03:47:56.910 --> 03:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
micro grid uh specific but we have a lot
 
03:47:59.349 --> 03:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
more folks looking at it than just me uh
 
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
so you know I think there's uh that's
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
something we would definitely take a
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
look at in this realm and and across
 
03:48:07.510 --> 03:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
energy I have uh go ahead representative
 
03:48:13.550 --> 03:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas then I'll have Co after
 
03:48:16.030 --> 03:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
that go ahead thank you thank you Mr
 
03:48:19.189 --> 03:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
chair um and this may be a question for
 
03:48:22.990 --> 03:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
um Keith uh um representative Aman I'm
 
03:48:26.790 --> 03:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
sorry um on line 26 it says the role of
 
03:48:28.590 --> 03:48:28.600 align:start position:0%
the micr grids in supporting economic
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
growth clean energy Innovation does that
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
include solar wind Hydro is that
 
03:48:38.030 --> 03:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
considered a contributors to these micro
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
grids yeah uh you know we we uh would
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
see that those Technologies as following
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know as as as inclusive or being
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
included within the bill yeah okay thank
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
you my question hopefully is not
 
03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
regarded as a loaded question um but it
 
03:49:02.510 --> 03:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:05.469 --> 03:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this if if this is approved
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
the the the study uh and the Consultants
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
that you have the high
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
is going to cost a bit of
 
03:49:15.309 --> 03:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
money are
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
we that confident that we're just not
 
03:49:22.149 --> 03:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
studying a pig and a poke where New
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really will never be
 
03:49:27.189 --> 03:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
interested in a microid or are we put or
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
are we putting together uh a a a study
 
03:49:35.149 --> 03:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
where we are serious that we can
 
03:49:37.950 --> 03:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
actually in install microids here in in
 
03:49:40.469 --> 03:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
the foreseeable future and and I don't
 
03:49:42.349 --> 03:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
mean that to be negative I just want to
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're just not doing this
 
03:49:46.830 --> 03:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
because people want to have a study
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
because it's going to cost money and I
 
03:49:49.630 --> 03:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're putting
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
money into in in into a study where we
 
03:49:56.229 --> 03:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
really think we have a good case uh I
 
03:49:58.110 --> 03:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
think we do but I mean I I just want to
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that we do have a good case
 
03:50:03.070 --> 03:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
that when we're done with the study that
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're actually G to do something it's a
 
03:50:07.790 --> 03:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
good definitely a fair question um and
 
03:50:11.710 --> 03:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
one that I would answer by saying that
 
03:50:13.189 --> 03:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would be clear
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
direction to the department that the
 
03:50:18.670 --> 03:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
legislature wants us to pursue you know
 
03:50:21.550 --> 03:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
um fixing or or or looking into the
 
03:50:23.229 --> 03:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
complexities related to microG grids and
 
03:50:25.710 --> 03:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
we would take that very seriously and
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
and look for those opportunities to
 
03:50:29.630 --> 03:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
implement them uh in the best interest
 
03:50:33.070 --> 03:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh micr grids as as
 
03:50:35.550 --> 03:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon talked about do
 
03:50:37.790 --> 03:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
have a lot of promise and and a lot of
 
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
benefits and and of of course there is
 
03:50:41.229 --> 03:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
some risk
 
03:50:43.510 --> 03:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
that they don't work out or that there
 
03:50:46.149 --> 03:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
is something that doesn't um fit for New
 
03:50:50.070 --> 03:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we would take a a a very
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
um hard look and and we would have this
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
statutory direction to uh you know find
 
03:50:59.229 --> 03:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
all those complexities and act in the
 
03:50:59.239 --> 03:51:01.189 align:start position:0%
all those complexities and act in the
public

03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:51:05.149 --> 03:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
interest yes you would but what do you
 
03:51:08.429 --> 03:51:08.439 align:start position:0%
think you know I I think there are a lot
 
03:51:10.990 --> 03:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
of there are a lot of benefits here that
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
um that are worth exploring and I think
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
the the promise is
 
03:51:20.590 --> 03:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
probably something that you know finding
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
out whether or not we can overcome the
 
03:51:25.590 --> 03:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
hurdles is a worthy
 
03:51:27.910 --> 03:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
Endeavor thank you to make sure we put
 
03:51:36.469 --> 03:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:39.429 --> 03:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
use representative Winnie Thomas thank
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um you mentioned um uh
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hawaii and California already have Micro
 
03:51:47.590 --> 03:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
grids do you have any idea of how many
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
or the percentage if that's if it's
 
03:51:52.110 --> 03:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
measured that way U no I do not I just
 
03:51:54.070 --> 03:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
know that they finally got some tariffs
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory in process uh to help and
 
03:51:58.030 --> 03:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
even with that they're still working
 
03:52:00.149 --> 03:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
through the Growing Pains of those kinds
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
of things I I do want to say that uh you
 
03:52:03.990 --> 03:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
know micro grids it's interesting
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
because I've been doing this for a long
 
03:52:07.950 --> 03:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
time it's not a New Concept every
 
03:52:09.550 --> 03:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
college campus on the plan in every
 
03:52:11.149 --> 03:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
hospital like I mentioned before anybody
 
03:52:13.389 --> 03:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
that can Island and be on their own and
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
start up on their own of course um
 
03:52:17.229 --> 03:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
that's technically a micro grid so
 
03:52:18.710 --> 03:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
clearly we know there are benefits of
 
03:52:21.389 --> 03:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
them the question is often and I have
 
03:52:24.110 --> 03:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
draw fulls of my old job of evaluating
 
03:52:25.950 --> 03:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
total energy facilities so we could be
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
independent or partially independent and
 
03:52:30.429 --> 03:52:30.439 align:start position:0%
and it's there are a lot of long-term
 
03:52:31.710 --> 03:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
planning assumptions so these things are
 
03:52:33.309 --> 03:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
not quick they will take time to to
 
03:52:34.710 --> 03:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
address all the issues is where where
 
03:52:36.349 --> 03:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going with this even though we would
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
like it to move a little faster um but I
 
03:52:40.630 --> 03:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
I think clearly it is's enough desire
 
03:52:41.630 --> 03:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
and there are there are a lot of
 
03:52:44.309 --> 03:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
benefits in certain cases for them so we
 
03:52:46.189 --> 03:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
we'll go through this investigation with
 
03:52:48.870 --> 03:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
our eyes wide open for
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
sure follow up thank you um just um for
 
03:52:56.590 --> 03:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
my own education can you have Micro
 
03:53:00.750 --> 03:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
grids I don't see why not um you know
 
03:53:05.269 --> 03:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
like I said technically if there's more
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
than one it's a micro grid right well
 
03:53:09.309 --> 03:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
you were talking about an island well
 
03:53:10.830 --> 03:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
islanding yeah islanding is when you
 
03:53:13.269 --> 03:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
segregate from the utility um and you
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
can run all by yourself and you're
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
completely divorced and and you can stay
 
03:53:18.389 --> 03:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
there and and then of course the key is
 
03:53:20.189 --> 03:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to sink back in right or in
 
03:53:21.189 --> 03:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
and out that's where the biggest
 
03:53:22.389 --> 03:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
problems come for the utilities where
 
03:53:23.950 --> 03:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
they got to manage that and that's where
 
03:53:25.910 --> 03:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
you get into a lot of the technical and
 
03:53:28.149 --> 03:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
and then also you know contractual type
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
stuff regulatory things like how much do
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
you have to pay for this backup power
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
and the ability so in any case yes you
 
03:53:36.070 --> 03:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
can have mic micro grids within a micro
 
03:53:38.349 --> 03:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
grid technically okay thank you
 
03:53:38.359 --> 03:53:40.229 align:start position:0%
grid technically okay thank you
representative

03:53:40.229 --> 03:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh thank you for taking
 
03:53:44.189 --> 03:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
the question um I was wondering how I
 
03:53:47.710 --> 03:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
going to segue this in but in in the
 
03:53:51.630 --> 03:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
study would doe also be looking
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
at they be Rec recommending yes no
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
different ones but if there is a pilot
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
plant generator would they be allowed to
 
03:54:06.670 --> 03:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
be separate from the grid for like
 
03:54:09.429 --> 03:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
demand things residenti but when things
 
03:54:11.790 --> 03:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
go down I'm looking at Capital being put
 
03:54:14.590 --> 03:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
in from outside investors and all of a
 
03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
sudden we we're P um
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
producing electricity then all of a
 
03:54:21.070 --> 03:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
sudden the grid goes down and ISO says
 
03:54:24.429 --> 03:54:24.439 align:start position:0%
you got to dump it to us for a pilot
 
03:54:26.910 --> 03:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
plant to put the money in I can only see
 
03:54:29.950 --> 03:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
it going forward and this is Segway off
 
03:54:31.750 --> 03:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh represent Doug
 
03:54:35.469 --> 03:54:35.479 align:start position:0%
Thomas's the money is if they
 
03:54:38.550 --> 03:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
can go on by themselves and then we can
 
03:54:40.510 --> 03:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
do the the rest of them separate is it a
 
03:54:43.269 --> 03:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
possible way yeah no and I I think
 
03:54:44.710 --> 03:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's a that that is a really good
 
03:54:47.149 --> 03:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
question and and part of why we support
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
the investigative proceeding uh as
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
happening before the pilots because it
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
can help us you know as a state
 
03:54:57.149 --> 03:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
determine the best way to um approach
 
03:55:00.349 --> 03:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
that relationship between the micro grid
 
03:55:02.229 --> 03:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
the state and then the region right the
 
03:55:05.149 --> 03:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
grid that were're a part of uh so you
 
03:55:06.590 --> 03:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
know I think that that's something that
 
03:55:08.309 --> 03:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
we would have to look at as part of the
 
03:55:08.319 --> 03:55:14.790 align:start position:0%
we would have to look at as part of the
investigative

03:55:14.790 --> 03:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:18.110 --> 03:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
proceeding um thank you again and I
 
03:55:21.229 --> 03:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
invite anyone else interested in joining
 
03:55:24.349 --> 03:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
in the frey thank you very much I I see
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh Mr lado from ever
 
03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
source so I'm sure he's going to um be
 
03:55:36.189 --> 03:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:39.389 --> 03:55:39.399 align:start position:0%
prey good afternoon uh again Michael
 
03:55:42.750 --> 03:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
Lata representing ever Source um I'll
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
keep my comments uh brief first of all
 
03:55:47.670 --> 03:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to really thank
 
03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon for reaching out uh
 
03:55:52.590 --> 03:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
he did uh talk to me about some of the
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had raised with the
 
03:55:55.389 --> 03:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill we had a great
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
conversation walking through um you know
 
03:56:00.870 --> 03:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
what he's trying to achieve and our
 
03:56:03.630 --> 03:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
experience on micro grids and uh we
 
03:56:07.790 --> 03:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
offered uh some options uh uh in terms
 
03:56:11.110 --> 03:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
of a pathway forward um so one of which
 
03:56:15.030 --> 03:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
was a investigation by the department of
 
03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
energy and I think the legislation does
 
03:56:21.429 --> 03:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
a good job of of laying out the areas of
 
03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh of interest that one would want to
 
03:56:26.870 --> 03:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
explore uh we had suggested uh a little
 
03:56:29.550 --> 03:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
bit of a different approach um you know
 
03:56:32.830 --> 03:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
we were coming from this where as the
 
03:56:34.349 --> 03:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
statutes exist today there's nothing
 
03:56:36.830 --> 03:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
that prohibits a utility from proposing
 
03:56:39.309 --> 03:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
a micro grid to the
 
03:56:42.030 --> 03:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
um Public Utilities Commission so one of
 
03:56:44.469 --> 03:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
the challenges that we have is because
 
03:56:47.309 --> 03:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
um as uh Deputy Commissioner Elm said
 
03:56:48.670 --> 03:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
this is you know there's not a lot of
 
03:56:49.990 --> 03:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
experience in the state and this is
 
03:56:54.030 --> 03:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat novel um you know how you
 
03:56:57.710 --> 03:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
present that at the commission um uh
 
03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
creates a little bit of risk so
 
03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
typically the utility goes in for a rate
 
03:57:04.790 --> 03:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
case every so often and that's to
 
03:57:06.830 --> 03:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
recover the cost of their prudently
 
03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
incurred um spending on the capital side
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh and the expense side and it's sort of
 
03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
an after Thea look where we haven't had
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
micro grids really in New Hampshire this
 
03:57:20.429 --> 03:57:20.439 align:start position:0%
is something new uh you can go in for
 
03:57:22.830 --> 03:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a pre-authorization you would
 
03:57:26.110 --> 03:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
file a plan uh have the commission and
 
03:57:28.110 --> 03:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
and various stakeholders weigh in on
 
03:57:30.910 --> 03:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
that and then you would go out and
 
03:57:32.630 --> 03:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
actually construct and then you get the
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
cost recovery after assuming that your
 
03:57:37.950 --> 03:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
expenses are your spending is prudent so
 
03:57:40.550 --> 03:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
what we had suggested was um simply to
 
03:57:42.630 --> 03:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
set up a framework that the commission
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
would review uh micro grid proposals by
 
03:57:48.189 --> 03:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
the utilities as part of our planning
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
framework um and uh understand you know
 
03:57:54.110 --> 03:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
the department and other stakeholders
 
03:57:56.429 --> 03:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
were you know wanted to do a little bit
 
03:58:00.389 --> 03:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
more information gathering um I think
 
03:58:02.670 --> 03:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
representative McGee um you know you
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
raised uh several good issues our focus
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
is really on um reliability uh would use
 
03:58:11.149 --> 03:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
this as a planning tool where we would
 
03:58:13.830 --> 03:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
identify areas of of poor system
 
03:58:16.910 --> 03:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
reliability do an evaluation if a micro
 
03:58:20.030 --> 03:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
grid uh made sense to support as as you
 
03:58:21.790 --> 03:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
talked about critical facilities in the
 
03:58:24.189 --> 03:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
area whether those are uh hospitals
 
03:58:27.429 --> 03:58:27.439 align:start position:0%
police stations University uh State
 
03:58:29.309 --> 03:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
facilities uh and then of course you
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
know what are the costs associated with
 
03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
that versus a traditional sort of wires
 
03:58:38.550 --> 03:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
um uh solution so uh that was that was
 
03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
our uh suggested approach was sort of
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
developing the framework and the
 
03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
criteria that you know what would the
 
03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
utility have to present in terms of
 
03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
information um to the Public Utilities
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
Commission and then what would be their
 
03:58:53.550 --> 03:58:53.560 align:start position:0%
criteria for reviewing and we tried to
 
03:58:56.149 --> 03:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
mirror it a little bit off of um
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
existing statute 374 G which allows for
 
03:59:01.309 --> 03:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
utility investment in distributed energy
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
resources so we kind of use that
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
definition uh we did pull in uh a
 
03:59:09.389 --> 03:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
version of the federal us Doe definition
 
03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
of of micro grid because I think it is
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
important um to to have sort of a
 
03:59:18.429 --> 03:59:18.439 align:start position:0%
definition around what a micro grid is
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
um and so so that was uh some of the
 
03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
concepts that we had had discussed um
 
03:59:26.670 --> 03:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
but certainly we understand that there's
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
sort of an interest uh in moving forward
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
with with further investigation we agree
 
03:59:32.750 --> 03:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
that um you know there's a lot of
 
03:59:34.189 --> 03:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
questions here these are very
 
03:59:37.070 --> 03:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
complicated from uh both a regulatory
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
but I would add from uh in our
 
03:59:40.830 --> 03:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
experience extremely complicated from an
 
03:59:44.229 --> 03:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
engineering standpoint the ability to to
 
03:59:47.149 --> 03:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
isolate and control uh and make it
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
essentially seamless for the customers
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
and also not have um and also the
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
integration with the larger distribution
 
03:59:55.790 --> 03:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
system there's a lot of work that goes
 
03:59:57.950 --> 03:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
into that uh which is why we felt that
 
03:59:59.710 --> 03:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
it was appropriate as part of uh the
 
04:00:03.269 --> 04:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
utility planning process so um happy to
 
04:00:05.189 --> 04:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh certainly
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
support uh the language that's uh in
 
04:00:09.229 --> 04:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
front of you on the
 
04:00:13.349 --> 04:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
investigation and uh look forward to to
 
04:00:15.910 --> 04:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
answering um I'll lead with with a
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
question um from a technical standpoint
 
04:00:22.590 --> 04:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
since you did mention it was extremely
 
04:00:26.229 --> 04:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
view have you been or is there available
 
04:00:31.870 --> 04:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
I know there's conferences from time to
 
04:00:35.070 --> 04:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
time around the world there must be one
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
involving uh micro grids or at least um
 
04:00:41.550 --> 04:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
ones that utilities send people to has
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
there been any uh presentations or
 
04:00:46.750 --> 04:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
discussions with California or Hawaii to
 
04:00:49.469 --> 04:00:49.479 align:start position:0%
find out what their engineering uh
 
04:00:52.309 --> 04:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
challenges were that you could glean
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
from that and see if they even apply
 
04:00:55.680 --> 04:00:57.309 align:start position:0%
from that and see if they even apply
here

04:00:57.309 --> 04:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:01:01.269 --> 04:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm I'm not familiar with uh
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
California and Hawaii I I would say we
 
04:01:07.149 --> 04:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
do have at ever Source uh experience
 
04:01:10.110 --> 04:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
with developing and managing micro grids
 
04:01:13.149 --> 04:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut and Massachusetts um and
 
04:01:16.429 --> 04:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
so you know certainly if the legislation
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
moves forward we would make uh you know
 
04:01:20.710 --> 04:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
those folks available to work with the
 
04:01:23.550 --> 04:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
department and discuss their experiences
 
04:01:26.349 --> 04:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
on an engineering standpoint um and a
 
04:01:28.189 --> 04:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
planning standpoint so we could
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
certainly offer those folks as as
 
04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
technical experts in support of a um of
 
04:01:33.319 --> 04:01:34.349 align:start position:0%
technical experts in support of a um of
an

04:01:34.349 --> 04:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
investigation uh my followup yes but you
 
04:01:38.510 --> 04:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
said that was extremely complicated so
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of curious if there are
 
04:01:45.510 --> 04:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
ways that we can lower the risk um by
 
04:01:48.269 --> 04:01:48.279 align:start position:0%
consolidating information from other
 
04:01:51.149 --> 04:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
states as well as the ones you uh
 
04:01:53.910 --> 04:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
interested in and and and again are
 
04:01:56.590 --> 04:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
there conferences that utilities do
 
04:01:58.750 --> 04:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
attend that these types of things could
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
be uh talked about I'm I'm not
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we you know send you to
 
04:02:05.550 --> 04:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
one specifically but I'm just kind of
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
curious if they have them around here
 
04:02:09.870 --> 04:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
and that people can kind combine their
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
ideas I'm just trying to lower Risk by
 
04:02:14.790 --> 04:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
sharing ideas sure no of of course and
 
04:02:18.110 --> 04:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
our folks attend um you know numerous
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
conferences and present at conferences
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
on our own experience and and what when
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
I speak to sort of the the engineering
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
technical um uh complexities it's it's
 
04:02:31.870 --> 04:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
you know the actual engineering of of
 
04:02:34.349 --> 04:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
the physical poles and wires and
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
distributed uh resources and having
 
04:02:38.750 --> 04:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
everything communicate at a central
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
location usually in a utility control
 
04:02:44.229 --> 04:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
room sort of the disconnect and and all
 
04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
that that goes into it um and we yeah we
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
we have folks who who are you know very
 
04:02:52.510 --> 04:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's what they do for a
 
04:02:55.229 --> 04:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
living thank
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
you next oh thank you nice he's giving
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
me's G me all right um membership has
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
its privileges okay so um my question
 
04:03:11.670 --> 04:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
was around whether or not eversource had
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
any involvement in the UNH pilot or
 
04:03:14.590 --> 04:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
whether that was something that was
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
being done specifically with the
 
04:03:19.349 --> 04:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
university like who was involved with
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
trying to pull that together and do you
 
04:03:22.830 --> 04:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
have any idea why it fell apart because
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
I I never heard it just stopped yeah uh
 
04:03:28.229 --> 04:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
this predates my time with the company
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh but and I I'd be happy to get you
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
more information that'd be great um but
 
04:03:34.750 --> 04:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
but we were involved in the development
 
04:03:37.750 --> 04:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
of that and I as I sit here don't have
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
the full story on why it didn't move
 
04:03:42.189 --> 04:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
forward but um I know we were involved
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
working with the the university on that
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you represent Winnie
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you um you mentioned that
 
04:03:51.670 --> 04:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
eversource has micro grids in
 
04:03:53.149 --> 04:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Massachusetts I think
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
you both said um
 
04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
so does eversource have any kind of and
 
04:04:02.790 --> 04:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is piggy pigtailing Pig pigtailing
 
04:04:05.830 --> 04:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know piggy backing sorry on
 
04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas's um question
 
04:04:10.030 --> 04:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
are there is there a document of best
 
04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
practices for these micr grids in
 
04:04:14.189 --> 04:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and
 
04:04:14.199 --> 04:04:17.429 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and
Massachusetts

04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
um I I can certainly share the
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and statutory framework that
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
um help support the development of micro
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
grids if there's a sort of technical
 
04:04:31.630 --> 04:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
best practices document I'll I'm happy
 
04:04:34.349 --> 04:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
team I would think there would be
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
something I mean that's standard isn't
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
it to have best practices identified
 
04:04:43.950 --> 04:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
sure I I just not sure I I can
 
04:04:46.550 --> 04:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank
 
04:04:50.189 --> 04:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for yes
 
04:04:52.830 --> 04:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative Colman not not a question
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
but to answer a question from our chair
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
I was just looking there is a microgrid
 
04:05:00.309 --> 04:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge conference uh it'll be held in
 
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
April and you're volunteering
 
04:05:06.880 --> 04:05:11.870 align:start position:0%
April and you're volunteering
right

04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:11.880 --> 04:05:15.229 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:05:15.229 --> 04:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:17.429 --> 04:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
you sorry anybody else would like to
 
04:05:19.229 --> 04:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
speak on this
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
issue okay seeing none I'll open it up
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
for discussion amongst our subcommittee
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
members um as to the merits of this
 
04:05:29.550 --> 04:05:29.560 align:start position:0%
amendment and if we want to recommend
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
going forward to recommend adoption of
 
04:05:34.990 --> 04:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:35.000 --> 04:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:05:40.349 --> 04:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
any discussion of course go ahead of
 
04:05:42.269 --> 04:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
course yes well the two things that I
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
took down for consideration of whether
 
04:05:48.510 --> 04:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
we want to modify it at all um is you
 
04:05:50.590 --> 04:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
know this is an act it says it's an act
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
requiring the department of energy to
 
04:05:56.790 --> 04:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
initiate a microid study and um I would
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
want to modify that language to say that
 
04:06:00.149 --> 04:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
helps the state of New Hampshire make
 
04:06:02.269 --> 04:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
micro grids a reality because I want it
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
to be Tethered to us actually having a
 
04:06:08.149 --> 04:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
concrete outcome what line is it um uh
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's right under the line three you
 
04:06:14.189 --> 04:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
know the N act right so so if rather
 
04:06:16.229 --> 04:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
than descript the description just being
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
vague and
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
saying uh that the really the point of
 
04:06:22.030 --> 04:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire is to make
 
04:06:23.870 --> 04:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
micro grids a reality right to figure
 
04:06:25.750 --> 04:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
out how to get it from Soup To
 
04:06:25.760 --> 04:06:27.590 align:start position:0%
out how to get it from Soup To
Nuts

04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
Nuts
 
04:06:30.149 --> 04:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
um and then there was also some
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
discussion early about whether we should
 
04:06:35.389 --> 04:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
have a finding section in order to
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
Define either the value of or the the
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
description of micro grids it sounds
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
like if the department of energy is
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
saying California and Hawaii have Micro
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
grids and eversource is saying we're
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
supporting microG grids in Connecticut
 
04:06:50.110 --> 04:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
and mass then maybe the definition of
 
04:06:51.990 --> 04:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
microG grids is different depending on
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
who you're talking to you know based on
 
04:06:57.149 --> 04:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
size or or whatever it's supporting or
 
04:07:00.670 --> 04:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
whose it is so I think it might be
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
valuable for us to Circle back to try
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
and have a finding section that
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
discusses what we mean by micro grids
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
right what's a micro grid going to do
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and uh how can it be
 
04:07:14.590 --> 04:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
used and who can use it it would be
 
04:07:18.149 --> 04:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
helpful this this this would requ this
 
04:07:22.030 --> 04:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
would require um work another amendment
 
04:07:23.429 --> 04:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
another iteration and we'd have to come
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
back and meet again just to vote on
 
04:07:28.830 --> 04:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
it well if we agreed to the amendment
 
04:07:30.630 --> 04:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
and we could circulate it amongst the
 
04:07:32.590 --> 04:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
folks on the committee we could bring it
 
04:07:34.990 --> 04:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
to the executive session and make make
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
our recommendation for the vote on the
 
04:07:36.840 --> 04:07:38.710 align:start position:0%
our recommendation for the vote on the
amendment

04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:07:42.309 --> 04:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
when it comes when it gets voted out of
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee we could the subcommittee
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
would still have to formally make a
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh at some time if you're
 
04:07:51.670 --> 04:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
suggesting we meet five minutes before
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
the executive session no so you're
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
saying none of what we heard today we
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're either going to take this or
 
04:07:58.429 --> 04:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
that's it well that's that's what I'm
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
asking if if we make any
 
04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
changes uh we what what would be we
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we couldn't vot we couldn't
 
04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
vote on something that was wasn't yeah
 
04:08:12.030 --> 04:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
an official draft of this correct y
 
04:08:13.710 --> 04:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm saying so I I I
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
guess the question is is can we can can
 
04:08:18.429 --> 04:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
we live with this the way it is I think
 
04:08:20.189 --> 04:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
the Bill's okay as it is I'm not not
 
04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
saying and then in in in the uh in the
 
04:08:24.910 --> 04:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
executive session or even in in
 
04:08:26.790 --> 04:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
legislation we could we could even
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
modify the amendment if needed that's
 
04:08:31.229 --> 04:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
true all right yeah then I'm I'm fine
 
04:08:33.830 --> 04:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
with moving it forward as is these are
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
just uh this is just word smithing
 
04:08:39.870 --> 04:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.269 --> 04:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
I see s Mr Sam Evans Brown hasn't spoken
 
04:08:46.030 --> 04:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
at all and so I highly unusual so I want
 
04:08:51.550 --> 04:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
next go
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
ahead if uh folks are looking for a
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
definition of micro grid there was a US
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
dooe definition of micro Grid in uh the
 
04:09:04.429 --> 04:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
suggested language that eversource had
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
put forward and so I have it right here
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
if folks I happy to email to the
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee if that's
 
04:09:09.760 --> 04:09:12.349 align:start position:0%
committee if that's
helpful

04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
sure represent am you had a a
 
04:09:18.149 --> 04:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
comment ditto
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay so we can take care of that
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:09:28.429 --> 04:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
chair um you know I I'm going to vote
 
04:09:32.349 --> 04:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
for this um I think it's it's a pretty
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh descriptive example of what we want
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
um my concern however are is the time
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
frame if you add everything together the
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
60 days the 120 days the year that comes
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
to 1.5 years and I think you brought
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
that up
 
04:09:50.950 --> 04:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
too um that's just one of my concerns
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's not enough to sync it for me but um
 
04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
I do have concerns about the time um I
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
do have concerns about the fiscal note
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
um lacking um again I mean if if it is
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
going to cost money to do the right
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
thing then we have to do that and then
 
04:10:09.309 --> 04:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
finally um I have concerns about and I
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
brought it up in a question on line 26
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
that clean energy Innovation I just
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
would like to see that uh defined I'm
 
04:10:20.830 --> 04:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
definitions What defined Define yeah
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
more specifically because I asked if it
 
04:10:29.429 --> 04:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
included solar and wind and and and the
 
04:10:32.349 --> 04:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
answer was yes it was but it's not
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
defined here so it feels like they don't
 
04:10:37.109 --> 04:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
have to consider it if they don't want
 
04:10:37.119 --> 04:10:38.990 align:start position:0%
have to consider it if they don't want
to

04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
um well I
 
04:10:44.510 --> 04:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
think there was a unofficial effort
 
04:10:47.070 --> 04:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
going around to try and have a
 
04:10:50.149 --> 04:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
definition of clean energy but I think
 
04:10:53.630 --> 04:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
it was decided that uh rather than than
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
narrow it down that it would be better
 
04:11:00.269 --> 04:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
to just um leave it open so that we know
 
04:11:02.070 --> 04:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
it we know it definitely includes
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
renewable energy we we know that and uh
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
possibly even asmrs but um
 
04:11:12.309 --> 04:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
I think I think the's suggestion or or
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
intent was to to leave
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
it generalized specific so that no
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
one one energy source was was picked out
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
in other words it wouldn't be just solar
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be just wind or just battery
 
04:11:29.950 --> 04:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
um no and I I can appreciate that and
 
04:11:31.630 --> 04:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
but we you're talking about clean energy
 
04:11:34.309 --> 04:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
but this is clean energy
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
Innovation and it's the Innovation that
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
has me a little concerned again it's not
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
enough for me to sync the bill and I'm
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
sure the Senate if they're not happy
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
with it they'll they'll get rid of it
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you uh although I'm not
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
officially member of the subcommittee I
 
04:11:54.990 --> 04:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
just want to speak to something that
 
04:11:57.109 --> 04:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative McGee said and I'm going
 
04:12:00.109 --> 04:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
to preface it by I once had a software
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
engineering job where the first thing I
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
did was a feasibility study for the
 
04:12:06.910 --> 04:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
product they hired me for and my answer
 
04:12:09.990 --> 04:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
was no no and uh as a result I was laid
 
04:12:11.229 --> 04:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
off very
 
04:12:14.030 --> 04:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
quickly um so an honest man is what
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
so when when I think about um saying
 
04:12:20.109 --> 04:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
that that we're going to require the
 
04:12:22.149 --> 04:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
part the doe to initiate a microG grid
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
study with a goal toward uh actually
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
implementing micr grids it's possible
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
that the conclusion of the study would
 
04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
be well actually these are infeasible or
 
04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
the costs of doing so are rather
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
prohibitive so I think it's probably
 
04:12:38.030 --> 04:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
better to not actually state that goal I
 
04:12:40.109 --> 04:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
think we all want micro grids but I
 
04:12:42.710 --> 04:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
think it's better to not State the the
 
04:12:52.229 --> 04:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.670 --> 04:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
Clause see any comment thank you uh
 
04:12:58.830 --> 04:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative Corman mentioned mine and
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
side okay well I um I agree I I think we
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
have enough here in this amendment to go
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
forward with a a recommendation I
 
04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
certainly would would support it I'm
 
04:13:15.710 --> 04:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
sure that by the time it reaches uh
 
04:13:17.950 --> 04:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
Prime Time there might be additional
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
amendments that might come forward after
 
04:13:22.590 --> 04:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
goes through committee and uh you know
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
whatnot but I think we have enough here
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
to uh to you uh recommend so unless
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
there's an objection from our four
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members uh I would like to
 
04:13:35.670 --> 04:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
open the uh executive session on the
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and call for a vote on the
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
